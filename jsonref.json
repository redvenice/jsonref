If we are forced by EU stubbornness to leave on WTO terms, we will be able to draw from the £39 billion budgeted for the Brexit deal, to help ease the transition.We could manage the short-term risks of leaving on WTO terms – not least after another six months to prepare for it.And, as the Institute for Government observed, it is ‘near impossible’ for MPs to stop a Prime Minister who is determined to leave in this way. I don’t want a WTO departure.          \u0027I would put together a Cabinet with wide-ranging experience, reflecting different views from across my party. This team would be united in the need to deliver Brexit by October 31, even if the EU refuses to move its position,\u0027 Mr Raab addedBut we must end this debilitating uncertainty – for businesses, and for trust in our democracy. Brexit is only the starting point for the change we need. We face the threat of a dangerous hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn who threatens jobs, our security, and gives succour to virulent anti-Semitism.The most potent antidote to Corbyn’s poisonous politics is an optimistic Conservative vision for the future – a fairer deal for Britain.We need a fairer deal for workers. That means grasping the opportunities of Brexit through a more energetic approach to global free trade – to boost small businesses, stimulate productivity to raise workers’ wages, and ease the cost of living by cutting prices for UK consumers.Next, we should cut taxes to give workers on low and middle incomes a pay rise, which many haven’t had for years. Raising the threshold for National Insurance to £12,500 and taking 1p off the basic rate of income tax will boost take-home pay for those on low incomes, saving the average worker £640 a year. We must also end consumer rip-offs, to deliver a fairer deal on everything from a student’s mobile phone contract to pensioners’ energy bills. And we must build a fairer society – to give the aspirational underdog in our country their shot in life.          Mr Raab said: \u0027We must also end consumer rip-offs, to deliver a fairer deal on everything from a student’s mobile phone contract to pensioners’ energy bills. And we must build a fairer society – to give the aspirational underdog in our country their shot in life\u0027This is personal to me. My father came here as a refugee aged six with no English. Britain gave him sanctuary and opportunity, through a grammar school education and a great job at Marks \u0026amp Spencer.Neither of my parents went to university. Both enjoyed successful careers, bought their own home, raised a family and lived the British dream. Those opportunities have narrowed for young people today. We won’t be taken seriously in Brussels unless we’re clear that we will walk away...  So we must renew our mission to break those glass ceilings, so every young person gets their chance to be a success, based on their abilities and hard work.I would revive Young Apprenticeships for 14- to 16-year-olds, and expand degree apprenticeships, like the one offered by Jaguar Land Rover in partnership with Warwick University – giving young people all of the opportunity of university, but without the debt.We must radically upgrade our ambition for building the homes young people and those on lower incomes can afford – overhauling stamp duty, releasing government- owned land and ramping up the delivery of homes for shared ownership. We should also recognise the generational shift in the way young families now work as a team.          \u0027Great challenges lie ahead. But they are challenges we can rise to with an optimistic vision for post-Brexit Britain. That’s why I am putting myself forward for the leadership of the Conservative Party,\u0027 he promisedLast week, I was proud to work with Maria Miller, the chairman of Parliament’s Equalities Select Committee, on plans to protect new mums who return to work from losing their job.We are also pressing for paternity leave reform. With two sons, aged six and four, I know how precious this can be. Paternity leave helps us dads bond with our children, and nurture a team ethic with our partners – one of the best ways to build more resilient families.And giving dads more opportunity to take on childcare responsibilities helps working mums to pursue their careers. It’s about empowering couples by giving them more choice.The next generation also cares passionately about the environment. The Luddite Labour Party won’t come up with credible solutions to climate change.So Conservatives must harness the power of innovation and technology to reinforce UK energy policy so that it makes environmental and economic sense.Great challenges lie ahead. But they are challenges we can rise to with an optimistic vision for post-Brexit Britain.That’s why I am putting myself forward for the leadership of the Conservative Party.That’s why I am fighting for a fairer deal for Britain – a fairer deal for workers, a fairer society, and a fairer deal from the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Rudd surprises Westminster defends Chinese tech giant Huawei","story":"Share this article          A friend of the Rudds insisted last night: ‘Amber and Roland lead totally independent lives and his business affairs have no impact on her views’"},{"url":null,"title":"Mel B brands Victoria Beckham bit b says loves her","story":"Make a statement like Mel in a dress by House of CBHouse of CB \u0026#39Nalani\u0026#39 dressGet it here!It’s safe to say Mel B’s wardrobe has had quite the overhaul in the years since the Spice Girls were at the height of their fame.

Lots of it. It was only a year since Zuckerberg had paid them $65 million following one of the most famous legal battles on the planet. They’d always been an unlikely match-up. Zuckerberg was nerdy and socially awkward the handsome Winklevoss brothers were twin embodiments of America’s East Coast elite who, already blessed with ‘brains the size of houses’, would go on to become members of America’s 2008 Olympic rowing team in Beijing.Two years later, they competed for Oxford in the Boat Race. Yet it was Zuckerberg who was making the real name for himself. From murky and contested origins, he was turning Facebook into one of the most powerful companies on Earth with a staggering 2.3 billion users.The problem, though, was this: the Winklevosses believed the idea for such a network had been theirs and that Zuckerberg had effectively stolen it from them. In 2011, after years of wrangling – which included a bizarre threat from Zuckerberg to ‘f*** them in the ear’ – they reached a settlement. Zuckerberg could certainly afford it as by this time his fortune was an estimated $15 billion.For the twins, this was a new beginning. It was a chance to disentangle themselves from the poisonous battles of the past four years and, as author Ben Mezrich explains in a compelling new book about the brothers, it brought the prospect of revenge in its sweetest known form – success.         Tyler and Cameron were cautious, replying that Bitcoin was just a gamble and that few get rich by gambling. ‘True,’ said Azar with a grin. ‘But you do get rich if you own the casino’       Yet, as Mezrich reveals, Zuckerberg cast a long shadow, something the twins would find out for themselves as they started to explore the strange new world of the technology boom. On one occasion, for example, they flew out to Silicon Valley in California to meet with a tech wizard looking for investors. Their appointment, it turned out, was in a burger bar with a nervous-looking red-haired young man called Jake. It was the sort of place where the whizzkids and tech geeks came to eat and talk between working at the headquarters of Facebook and Google, Apple and PayPal nearby.Yet by the time they sat down, Jake had already gone cold. No one looking for start-up capital in Silicon Valley would dare take investment cash ‘from the two guys Zuckerberg hates more than anyone else in the world,’ he explained. ‘You should be glad this place will even serve you a hamburger.’ The Winklevoss twins knew then they needed something entirely separate from the giant corporations of the Valley, something utterly brilliant. It would be the start of their gamble with the shadowy new world of cryptocurrency – and their ascent to a new level of fame and fortune based on an invention so powerful it might even eclipse the billions of Zuckerberg.  Google was born in a garage. PayPal was first pitched in a Silicon Valley pancake restaurant. And the Bitcoin investment revolution started in an Ibiza nightclub at 3am in July 2012.The muscular guy with the big idea was a man called David Avar. When the three of them met again at the Blue Marlin beach club – where a sun lounger costs £350 for one afternoon – he was sober. And, as the twins listened, it all started to make sense. With Facebook you could befriend anyone in the world. With Skype you could talk to anyone in the world. But try to move money around, and the banks would do it at a snail’s pace and take a cut for themselves.Money was still controlled by institutions formed centuries before the internet. Bankers, governments, bureaucrats: all of them had a say in what you did with your money – your money, not theirs.         The brothers have a long way to go to match their enemy Zuckerberg, who is reckoned to be worth almost $69 billionAvar explained that it was time for money to become cryptocurrency with no human authority in charge and no headquarters. This would be a currency of digital data and pure maths, money that moved at the speed of electricity. The implications were staggering.Tyler and Cameron were cautious, replying that Bitcoin was just a gamble and that few get rich by gambling. ‘True,’ said Azar with a grin. ‘But you do get rich if you own the casino.’Even today, the whole Bitcoin business looks like a mad gamble.But for the Winklevoss twins, widely read in economics, Bitcoin looked like something else entirely. First set up in 2009 by someone calling himself (or themselves) Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows people to send or receive money across the internet. No identities are revealed or required, only encrypted ‘addresses’. It is also ‘decentralised’, meaning, in a sense, that there are no human beings in charge. It is rather governed by the laws of mathematics, and processed via computers.The Winklevosses did some research. Every establishment figure they talked to dismissed Bitcoin as a scam, a Ponzi scheme. But what about cash, they replied? No longer linked to gold, any government could print as much as it liked. Wasn’t that a Ponzi scheme? In contrast, the total number of Bitcoins had been fixed for ever at 21 million by its shadowy creator. It would never change.Then the brothers started meeting stranger figures still, including a jittery, pot-smoking 22-year-old called Charlie Shrem. A tech genius, he still lived in his mother’s basement in New York, and believed in Bitcoin with a passion.They encountered an obese recluse called Mark Karpeles, who ran the Bitcoin exchange itself – which implemented the transactions. They met passionate libertarians who saw Bitcoin as a way of taking back power from the state.The cryptocurrency was also becoming a favourite of criminals, most notoriously on the so-called Dark Web. Cryptocurrency was the Wild West. But for Tyler and Cameron, the arguments were convincing. It was good maths. After all, no one eschewed cash just because criminals liked using it. The same went for Bitcoin.Soon afterwards, they put $800,000 into the BitInstant company, an electronic platform for buying and selling the currency, and began to buy heavily into Bitcoins themselves. They started learning about cybersecurity. They worked on ‘cold’ computers that had been purchased new and never connected to the internet. The twins used these to set up accounts and store data. They bought a 16-sided dice to generate random numbers for passwords.On one occasion, Cameron took a sledgehammer to a laptop to make sure they’d left no digital fingerprints. Soon, the Winklevosses would put $11 million into the virtual currency, which at that time bought them about one per cent of all the Bitcoins in existence.           Richard Branson invested in another Bitcoin-dealing platform called BitPayAround the world, Bitcoin was derided as a scam, yet the value kept going up. And then, in 2013, something happened to dramatically change the way the world saw cryptocurrency. When the EU bailed-out the tottering Cyprus economy, it did so on condition that the government order a huge levy on all bank holdings over €100,000 (£88,150). The EU called it a tax, but to others it seemed a staggering act of theft from private bank accounts – many held by Russians – and on a colossal scale. It was just as the libertarians of Bitcoin had warned: governments and banks could not be trusted.The price of a single Bitcoin unit rose from $80 to $260 in a matter of weeks.Then in April 2013 The New York Times ran a headline that made the brothers’ hearts soar: ‘Never Mind Facebook: Winklevoss Twins Rule in Digital Money.’ It was a dream come true for the brothers – and they started living that dream to the full. Among America’s most eligible batchelors, they share an interest in tall, dark-haired beauties, with models Amanda Salvato, Natalia Beber and supermodel Irina Shayk appearing on their arms. They own separate luxury apartments in Manhattan, but routinely stay together at one or the other, and share ownership of an £18 million contemporary mansion in the Hollywood Hills.Bitcoin was even becoming respectable. Richard Branson invested in another Bitcoin-dealing platform called BitPay. ‘A million dollars isn’t cool,’ Tyler Winklevoss was now saying. ‘You know what’s cool? A billion dollars … in Bitcoin.’  The brothers have a long way to go to match their enemy Zuckerberg, who is reckoned to be worth almost $69 billion. Even so, their one per cent ownership of all Bitcoins is worth around £1,323,000,000, making them the world’s first known Bitcoin billionaires. They have also established a cryptocurrency exchange business called Gemini, itself valued at another billion or so.Believing passionately in the future of cryptocurrency, Tyler and Cameron claim that Bitcoin is, in fact, ‘gold 2.0,’ another form of investment safe from economic downturns and crashes. Then, yesterday, came perhaps the strangest twist of all in this astonishing story – when it was revealed that the Winklevoss twins have been approached by a major figure from Silicon Valley to collaborate in launching a new cryptocurrency, a digital coin that will be tied to the value of the US dollar. The figure in question is Mark Zuckerberg. For more than a year, a secretive Facebook unit has been working on the project, aiming at a currency to be used across Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and beyond. Reportedly called GlobalCoin, it is due to be launched next year.  The first commercial transaction involving Bitcoin took place on May 22, 2010, when a computer programmer in Florida called Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas because he liked to have a bit of spare pizza around to nibble on the next day.Ten thousand Bitcoins were worth about $30 then, so $15 per pizza, with home delivery, was about right.A young student took him up on the offer, and the pizzas were duly delivered. If Hanyecz had kept a hold on those Bitcoins, today they would be worth around £62,800,000.Even Zuckerberg, the eighth-richest man in the world, has taken notice. But this time, it’s advantage Winklevoss.Bitcoin Billionaires by Ben Mezrich is published by Little, Brown priced £20."},{"url":null,"title":"Council boss urges staff not answer calls switchboard quickly","story":"Share this article His comments prompted a sharp reminder from campaigners for the elderly that not everyone can access the internet. ‘Public services should always offer multiple ways of contacting them, especially via the phone to ensure those who are offline don’t miss out,’ said Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK.Councillor Derek Bastiman echoed her concerns.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Total of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 60 candidates running in 29-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 39-seat constituencyTotal of 47 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyGreen election victories for Chu and partner Patrick CostelloTaoiseach says FG under-performed against expectations in local electionsMan in his late 30s was fatally injured in road traffic incident at Oulart, GoreyTotal of 49 candidates running in 20-seat constituencyTotal of 67 candidates running in 34-seat constituencyCannabis herb, cannabis resin and cocaine uncovered during Garda operation in FinglasTotal of 79 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 35 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyDivorce referendum passes by high margin as Green wave sweeps through localsTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituency"},{"url":null,"title":"d%C3%BAn laoghaire rathdown county council greens top the polls with three seats","story":"In keeping with the Green theme of the day, the Green Party’s Daniel Dunne topped the poll in Dundrum and was elected on the first count with a substantial surplus of more than one thousand votes.

He predicted the party would secure eight or even nine seats in the city of the 10 candidates the Greens ran for the city’s 11 wards.Asked if the party should have run more candidates in the city, Mr Ryan said it certainly could have run a second in Pembroke. “We could have run two here and we would have won two here.”With the possibility that the Greens could be the largest party on the council Mr Ryan said their strategy for the coming term would be “about more than just iding up mayors and chairs” and would see the party pushing for real environmental measures to be taken at council level.Chu born in Ireland, to parents from Hong Kong, is the partner of sitting Green city councillor Patrick Costello. She said it was “a bit overwhelming but great privilege” to be elected.Two Green candidates who were celebrating in the RDS were Michael Pidgeon and Hazel Chu, both of whom are poll toppers.Hazel Chu topped the poll in the Pembroke area with more than 2,000 votes above the quota, told The : “Politics was never part of what we do. Both my parents were kitchen workers, they washed dishes. It wasn’t until I met my partner Patrick Costello who is, hopefully, a councillor in Kimmage Rathmines because he is topping the poll, that I decided to get involved in the Greens. I decided you know what, I’ll put my name forward.”Mr Pidgeon said at one stage he expected to have to fight for the last seat instead of topping the poll. “I am a little bit in shock. I’m really humbled. We thought we would be scrapping away for the last seat here. There hasn’t been a Green councillor here for 25 years,” he said. “There is a part of me that’s aware that we worked really hard on the campaign. This isn’t a personal vote, it’s not even really a party vote. It’s a vote about the issues the Government are not tackling. From what I can tell, looking at the areas where we got the votes, they were coming in from areas including areas that wouldn’t have been traditionally Green at all.”French-born Sophie Nicoullaud was elected for the Green Party in the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh Dublin City Council ward, as yet another first time candidate brought in on a surge of popularity for the party.Sitting Sinn Féin councillor Daithí Doolan topped the poll in the ward, and was followed by Solidarity-People Before Profit candidate Hazel de Nortúin on the eight count. A strong number of transfers for Ms Nicoullaud, who moved to Ireland in 2006, saw her take the third seat in the ninth and final count.Independent councillor Vincent Jackson retained his seat, finishing behind Ms Nicoullaud. It was initially announced that Michael Jackson had been elected to the council, a mistake quickly corrected by the returning office team. Fianna Fáil’s Daithí de Róiste took the last seat in the ward, beating the Labour Party candidate Michael O’Sullivan by 178 votes.The Greens knocked another one out of the park with Claire Bryne, one of their three sitting councillors, topping the poll in the South East Inner City. Byrne was a comfortable winner with 1,961 first preferences ahead of the 1,144 quota in this five seater.Sinn Fein’s Chris Andrews, once a Fianna Fáil councillor, but now a full council term in Sinn Féin, took a seat after the fourth count.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Election surges of differing political hues have littered the Irish political landscape for decades, but the green wave of 2019 is different.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald described the latest manifestation as “a green tsunami”, which is an accurate description of her party’s losses to the Greens, especially in Dublin.The surge this time means the Greens will go close to trebling their council seats, get them back into major cities such as Cork, Limerick and Galway, and may give them three European Parliament seats if they live up to its transfer-friendly reputation.Three factors contributed to this far from overnight success. Firstly, the party re-organisation after the 2016 election greatly strengthened the candidatepolicy mix.Secondly, along with climate NGOs, they helped bring awareness of climate change into consciousness of almost every Irish citizen. Climate breakdown is a hard sell because of complex science and the perception of it being “a future problem”.That included getting politicians to understand and accept the gravity of the climate crisis. A critical factor was the completion of a landmark report from the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action (CCA). This may be hard for other parties to swallow: The exercise demonstrated the Greens already had in place the best climate policies, displayed better understanding of climate science, and were most persuasive on the need for urgent action.UCD environmental policy fellow Dr Cara Augustenborg felt there would be a green wave bigger than polls suggested simply because politicians were saying climate change was in the top five issues coming up on doorstep. “Finally climate has become a doorstep issue that has translated into votes.”The science on global heating and accelerating wildlife loss has seen off climate science deniers. A global movement seeking the prioritising of wellbeing of both planet and citizens, ahead of obsession with growth is gaining momentum.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan noted their vote is “reflective of a green wave of thinking that’s happening all over the world, all across Europe. We were waiting for it to rise here and it has risen today.”It’s broad-based and across generations but strongest among people in their 20s and 30s, who are increasingly concerned about their carbon footprint, and are unlikely to abandon them in a general election as they are not loyal to old FGFF politics.The Green Party is no longer an eclectic mix of well-meaning eco campaigners who consume elderflower wine. It is no longer a one-policy party, Ms Augustenborg says. “They have an opportunity now to show they are not a one-trick pony”.Yes for many, voting green is an easy way to signal virtue and they probably did not read the small print of their manifesto – notably on carbon tax. But Mr Ryan consistently flags this is just one of many necessary measures.The message to Government is emphatic guilt-tripping iniduals won’t work, it’s about leadership and urgency.Climate researcher Sadhbh O’Neill who advised independents on the CCA underlines a new scenario: “Firstly, climate change is a real threat demanding urgent political action. The policies that are needed won’t happen without political intervention. We’re not going to get a redirection of public funding towards public transport and cycling, or towards sustainable land-use and social housing, for example, without a change of politics, at government and local authority level.”Passing fancyThe Green wave won’t be a passing fancy, she says. “If anything, the new era of climate politics is only beginning. I believe the entire political debate will reorganise itself around green issues, out of necessity and urgency if nothing else.”But the Greens will find it hard in practice to implement policies at a local level. “Our local government system is designed to make politics singularly ineffective at this level, regardless of who’s in power. Funding, policies and many spending programmes are controlled by central government, and it’s not obvious that the FG-led government is ready to relinquish any of its pet projects such as the road schemes in Project Ireland 2040 any time soon.”They won’t necessarily have a voting majority anywhere to drive its policies through. So to be effective, its representatives “will need to demonstrate tenacity in holding these bodies to account, along with a pragmatic approach to working with other parties to achieve results,” Ms O’Neill says.“It’s vital that local authorities now review every aspect of their development planning and budgets and put climate change and environment centre stage. That means prioritising active modes such as cycling and walking over cars, and reducing the demand for car-based transport with sensitive land-use planning that promotes social and affordable housing, good quality and mixed urban design in all of our towns and cities.”“Some quite basic functions that can green our urban environments and our transport options like footpath widening, public green spaces and dedicated cycle lanes and greenways are within the capacity of local authorities to deliver.”In rural areas, there is a need to see an extension and development of Local Link transport services, combined with greenways and better support for public transport solutions and EV charging points. “Planning authorities are key to making the shift to sustainable land-use and transport so we need to curtail out of town retail developments and the suburbanisation of the countryside.”Mr Ryan is set to push this local agenda, bringing sustainable development back to the core of local government, including an overhaul of land use to move more urgently.Ms O’Neill suspects “climate anxiety” is a factor attaching itself to competent, policy-oriented candidates that look like they have solutions. “Green politicians, by their rhetoric as well as their actions, can help to shift the political narrative towards a conversation about how to plan for the uncertain future where the effects of climate change will loom large.”European platformThe Greens will potentially be a dominant party in the next EP and counter balance far-right parties marked by nationalism and climate science scepticism.In the middle, will be an attempt to forge emerging consensus is to strengthen the EU’s 2050 target of moving to net-zero emissions. CAP reform will be a key priority in ensuring more sustainable family farms.Yet the steps to get there remain highly contested. The net-zero goal raises tough questions about the future for coal mining and car-making communities in Europe, and the sustainability of trade relations outside it.If Ireland delivers three Green MEPs, it could make a significant contribution to them becoming a dominant party, which would be a game changer in making a more social than defence-orientated Europe.On the home front, managing success will be a challenge. “That means translating these successes into Dáil seats, developing the party at a local level so that it can field more candidates and turn itself into a real political force around the country. If the party wins three EP seats, it will have the resources and the visible political presence to reshape Irish politics in the next general election,” Ms O’Neill adds.Nationally, top of its agenda will be recasting the National Development Plan because of a glaring shortfall in delivering emissions reductions and a reversal of the 2 to 1 ratio of roads development to public transport investment.“The mandate for politicians is clear – act now and act boldly to make the right choices in environmental protection, in nature-friendly farming, in sustainable energy, in public transport, and in housing,” says environmental pillar co-ordinator Michael Ewing. “Our citizens are clearly crying out for a vision for the future of both Europe and Ireland that puts climate action, bioersity protection and environmental justice at the core of the bloc’s policies.”Fortunately, a climate action plan with real potential to decarbonise Ireland is almost ready to roll out if vigorous implementation accompanies it.As for the rash of love bombing the Greens that has broken out, Mr Ryan doesn’t mind if it means parties become more ambitious on climate. It this happens, he says, the electorate will have done a good job.On this occasion, his party benefitted as voters saw through the late conversion of others on the need for meaningful climate action.Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3904700.1558808796!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the sinn f%C3%A9in election postmortem could be pretty brutal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader  Mary Lou McDonald at the count centre in the RDS. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEven very early on in the count, it was shaping to be a very difficult weekend for Sinn Féin and its leader, who now faces her second disaster - two out of two - in her second national election in the South since she became leader early last year.Friday night’s exit poll signalled the difficulties ahead. Two of the three European Parliament seats should be OK, but the Dublin seat, held by Lynn Boylan, is in grave danger. Whatever happens with the final counts in Dublin, the party’s vote in the Euros has cratered. And the party’s share of the vote in the local elections, the poll predicts, is due to slump to 12 per cent.In recent hours, bulletins from around the country have borne out what that is likely to mean in terms of seats. The party’s vote has collapsed in Tullamore and Birr, reports from the count said, poking the wound opened by the acrimonious departure of TD Carol Nolan over the party’s support for legalising abortion.Seats would fall all over Dublin, party figures ruefully conceded. In Mary Lou McDonald’s home patch in Dublin Central, the party will be struggling to win one seat. The general election candidate in Tipperary won’t even win a council seat, it looks like. In Cavan, the party ran two candidates in the three local electoral areas and runs the risk of having none of them elected, early reports said. Same in Galway. Bad day in Louth, too. And so it went, around the country.Put this in the context of Sinn Féin’s longer-term trend in recent elections. Since the 1990s, when the peace settlement in the North began the political detoxification of Sinn Féin in the south, the party has steadily grown its share of the vote in local and national elections. Starting in 1994, the party’s share of the vote in the European elections has gone from three to six to 11 to 19 per cent. In the locals, it has gone to from two, to three, to eight - back to seven and a half - and up to 15 per cent in 2014.The general election graph looks similar.It’s not that there haven’t been stutters in the past. McDonald lost her Euro seat in 2009. The party lost one of its Dáil seats in 2007 (though the share of the vote went up). But stutters are one thing there’s never been a full scale reversal like this. The Sinn Féin election postmortem could be pretty brutal.In the past, Sinn Féin’s links to the IRA hurt them with a lot of voters, but as time moves on, and a new non-military generation takes over, that is less of a factor. In a way, that makes the political difficulties more serious.There’s never one single reason for a big electoral failure. But some reasons are more important than others. Many voters seem unimpressed with the record of Sinn Féin councillors - several of whom, of course, have left the party amid internal difficulties. Nor have voters haven’t responded to the party’s trenchant opposition to the Government on every issue that emerges in national politics. But if everything is a scandal, nothing is a scandal. The party’s campaigning on Brexit has done it few favours, it seems, perhaps unimpressed by the failure to revive the Northern power-sharing institutions, or even take its seats at Westminster.But there’s also a more basic question. When McDonald took over the leadership, she was on a mission to enter government in Dublin - as a minority partner if necessary - a strategic move made in tandem with an appeal to the middle ground, and the middle class. It hasn’t quite worked out that way. And if the main theme an purpose of McDonald’s leadership has been thrown off course, then she will need to do one of two things: get it on back on course, or get a new one.Some hard thinking, and hard choices, await her.Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903651.1558726772!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory leadership race candidates jostle for position after may s exit","story":"British prime minister Theresa May has announced that she will leave her office, three years after succeeding David Cameron.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish  prime minister Theresa May making a statement outside 10 Downing Street. She   has announced that she will resign on Friday, June 7th. Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesCandidates to succeed Theresa May as British prime minister were jostling for position last night after she announced her resignation in a tearful statement outside 10 Downing Street.Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would contest the Conservative leadership, joining his predecessor Boris Johnson and international trade secretary Rory Stewart.Other cabinet ministers are expected to follow in the coming days, including home secretary Sajid Javid, environment secretary Michael Gove, defence secretary Penny Mordaunt and health secretary Matt Hancock.Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is also expected to join the race, and former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is considering a second leadership bid.Watched by her husband Philip and senior aides, Mrs May’s voice cracked as she almost broke down towards the end of her statement announcing that she would resign as Conservative leader on June 7th.\u0026nbspMajority\u0026nbspShe said she had done her best to win a parliamentary majority for the withdrawal agreement, and warned her successor that compromise was needed to agree any Brexit deal.“It will be for my successor to seek a way forward that honours the result of the referendum. To succeed, he or she will have to find consensus in parliament where I have not. Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise.”Ms May’s resignation puts Brexit in a new phase that may be “very dangerous for Ireland”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said. Mr Varadkar said her departure could lead to the election of a “Eurosceptic” prime minister.The Taoiseach said her successor may scrap the Brexit withdrawal agreement. “We may see the election of a Eurosceptic prime minister who wants to repudiate the withdrawal agreement and go for no-deal, or we may even see a new British government that wants a closer relationship with the EU and goes for a second referendum,” said Mr Varadkar. But the Taoiseach said that whatever happens, the Irish Government will “hold its nerve”.NominationsMrs May will stay on as prime minister until a new Conservative leader is elected. Nominations will close on June 10th, and MPs will then vote in successive rounds to choose two candidates to go before all members of the party, with a result expected in late July.The clear frontrunner is Mr Johnson, who told a conference in Switzerland on Friday that he would not seek a further article 50 extension beyond the end of October. “We will leave the EU on October 31st, deal or no deal.”He suggested that he would seek to negotiate changes to the Brexit deal, but would leave without an agreement if necessary.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

I think about how cool it will be to see Idris Elba resume his role as a world-weary London homicide detective in Luther. I think about what a harrowing tale Patrick Radden Keefe has woven in Say Nothing: a True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland.But once I’m completely awake, a gravitational pull takes hold and I am once more bedevilled by our preposterous president.I flip on the TV and gird for the endless stream of vitriol coming from the White House, bracing for another day of overflowing, overlapping, overwrought news stories about President Donald Trump. I’m sapped before I rise.As mayor Pete Buttigieg said on his Fox town hall about the national Trump preoccupation, “It is the nature of grotesque things that you can’t look away.”My head hurts, puzzling over whether Trump is just a big blowhard who’s flailing around, or a sinister genius laying traps to get himself impeached to animate the base ahead of the election.A minute ago, we were fixated on the half of the Mueller report that vividly details how Trump tried to shut down and hinder the Mueller investigation. But now the president has triggered the media’s shock collar, so everyone is fixated on how he gave William Barr vast new powers to use the intelligence agencies to investigate the investigators.Daily onslaughtJust as Trump once wore out contractors, bankers, lawyers and businesspeople in New York with his combative, insulting and wayward ways, now he’s wearing out the political crowd, as he tries to beat everybody here into submission with his daily, even hourly, onslaught of outrage piled upon outrage.Journalists must not become inured to Trump’s outlandish, transgressive behaviour. Mitch McConnell, Barr and almost everyone else in the GOP have made themselves numb to his abhorrent actions because of self-interest.But for those who are concerned about the scarring of the American psyche, it’s exhausting to find the vocabulary to keep explaining, over and over, how beyond the pale and out of the norm the 45th president is.How do you ratchet up from “remarkable,” “extraordinary,” “unprecedented”?What words can you use about someone who considers pardoning war criminals on Memorial Day? Who wants to make it simpler for adoption agencies to bar same-sex couples? Who circumvents Congress to complete arms deals to benefit the same Saudis who are clearly culpable in the case of the dismembered Washington Post columnist?Buttigieg and Nancy Pelosi have both mastered the art of puncturing Trump – far better than his Republican primary debate rivals did.“I don’t have a problem standing up to somebody who was working on season seven of Celebrity Apprentice when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan,” Buttigieg told the Post’s Robert Costa, saying he took a dim view of Trump’s bone-spurs excuse to get out of serving in Vietnam.Pelosi winds Trump up when she drips condescension worthy of a Jane Austen grande dame, saying she will pray for the president or pleading for someone to stage an intervention with the poor soul.After Pelosi remarked that the president was engaged in a cover-up, Trump dynamited his own meeting with “Crazy Nancy,” as he called her. His ‘I’m not crazy, you’re crazy’ rebuttal to Pelosi echoed his ‘I’m not a puppet, you’re a puppet’ line to Hillary Clinton during the debate.Trump tweeted a video of Pelosi that was manipulated to make her look as if she were slurring her words.“Well, I don’t know about the videos,” the president told reporters as he left on his trip to Japan.Destructive“He does outrageous, nasty, destructive things, knowing full well he’s crossing a line, and then he pretends he didn’t,” said Trump biographer Tim O’Brien. “He has spent five decades going to gossip columnists, radio shows, TV interviews and newspapers to stick a knife into almost anybody who crosses his path that he doesn’t like and he revels in it. There is something amazing in the Energiser Bunny aspect of his nastiness and his ignorance. He doesn’t care what people think about how mean or dumb he is. He just keeps going.”O’Brien said Pelosi “hit on something that is core to his con. His whole life is about the cover-up. He has covered up his academic record, his health reports, his dalliances with women, his finances, his family history. Even while he was saying he was the most transparent president in history, his treasury secretary was across town telling Congress, ‘I’m not giving you the president’s tax returns.’“One of the biggest motivating factors in Trump’s life – other than food, greed, sex and revenge – is mythmaking. Deep down, he knows he’s a pathological liar and he’s not the person he says he is. But any time anyone pierces that veil, it sends him into a rage.”It’s wearing, not letting this petulant man wear us all out. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeEuropean elections results live: National projections announced ahead of official results - latest newsComment: We must exploit the EU\u0026#39s growing isions to push for a better dealSteal pebbles from beach and risk prosecution, visitors in Pembrokeshire warnedJodie Chesney: 17-year-old boy charged with teenager\u0026#39s murderEven after Brexit, the decisions made in these European Parliament elections will have an impact on BritainChancellor warns next PM \u0026#39will not survive\u0026#39 if they try to force a no-deal Brexit - and hints at supporting no confidence motionRussia launches new nuclear-powered icebreaker in bid to tap Arctic potentialBar owner says health-conscious customers who only order tap water are ruining her businessIreland referendum: Voters back plan to allow orce without four-year separation Care home residents offered NHS Skype calls in bid to cut hospital visitsTwo people charged over Sheffield teenager house deaths following \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39Owners of replica Noah\u0026#39s Ark sue insurers for flood damage compensationMichael Gove: Back me for Tory leader to beat Jeremy Corbyn and deliver BrexitWhy going for a \u0026#39Ruby Murray\u0026#39 may never be the same againComment: Brexit Party\u0026#39s rise forced dithering Tory MPs to ditch Theresa MayJews warned against wearing kippa skullcaps as anti-Semitism rises in GermanyComment: Dreading old age?

By 2000 this figure dropped to almost 28,000.The country has now seen no new infections since 2013 and is the first nation in WHO Africa region to be declared malaria-free in more than 40 years – only  Mauritius, which achieved the goal in 1973, has also eliminated the disease in the region. “Algeria is where the malaria parasite was first discovered in humans almost a century and a half ago, and that was a significant milestone in responding to the disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO regional director for Africa.“Now Algeria has shown the rest of Africa that malaria can be beaten through country leadership, bold action, sound investment and science. The rest of the continent can learn from this experience,” she said. War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Algeria\u0027s success has been due to a combination of free malaria diagnosis and treatment and a well-trained health workforce. Similar factors have helped Argentina eradicate the parasitic disease – the second country in South America to do so following Paraguay last year. “Argentina reported the last indigenous case in 2010 and has demonstrated the commitment, the capacity within its health, laboratory and surveillance systems, and the necessary financing to prevent the re-establishment of malaria within the country”, said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, director of the WHO Pan American Health Organization.“I am sure that Argentina will serve as an inspiration and as an example for other countries of the Americas to achieve the elimination of malaria in the coming years,” she added. India and Rwanda have made huge progress in tackling malariaAccording to the 2018 World Malaria Report, China is also close to eradicating the disease and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Pakistan have reduced infection levels. The countries are a highlights in an otherwise gloomy global picture. The countries with the highest disease burden are all moving backwards, including Nigeria, DRC, Mozambique and Uganda.“The news that Algeria and Argentina have been declared malaria free is a remarkable achievement for both countries,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria.“As well as saving precious lives and strengthening health systems, malaria-free status provides external economic benefits for these countries enabling them to free up resources to address other health and development priorities and improve worker productivity and school attendance.“Other countries now have two more nations that serve as examples of how elimination can be achieved,” Dr Diallo added.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security European elections results live: National projections announced ahead of official results - latest newsComment: We must exploit the EU\u0026#39s growing isions to push for a better dealSteal pebbles from beach and risk prosecution, visitors in Pembrokeshire warnedJodie Chesney: 17-year-old boy charged with teenager\u0026#39s murderEven after Brexit, the decisions made in these European Parliament elections will have an impact on BritainChancellor warns next PM \u0026#39will not survive\u0026#39 if they try to force a no-deal Brexit - and hints at supporting no confidence motionRussia launches new nuclear-powered icebreaker in bid to tap Arctic potentialBar owner says health-conscious customers who only order tap water are ruining her businessIreland referendum: Voters back plan to allow orce without four-year separation Care home residents offered NHS Skype calls in bid to cut hospital visitsTwo people charged over Sheffield teenager house deaths following \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39Owners of replica Noah\u0026#39s Ark sue insurers for flood damage compensationMichael Gove: Back me for Tory leader to beat Jeremy Corbyn and deliver BrexitWhy going for a \u0026#39Ruby Murray\u0026#39 may never be the same againComment: Brexit Party\u0026#39s rise forced dithering Tory MPs to ditch Theresa MayJews warned against wearing kippa skullcaps as anti-Semitism rises in GermanyComment: Dreading old age?

This is partly down to people wanting to drink healthier or non alcoholic drinks (which is great), but as we offer around 50 different options for those not wanting to drink alcohol it certainly can\u0027t account for all of them.So I wanted to highlight to those people that them drinking tap water means we are unlikely to meet the average spend from their visit required to break even or turn a profit.She added that offering tap water costs the business money, explaining: Lastly we are also paying for the dishwasher, the glass, the tea towels to dry it, the bartender, the front of house person, and everything else associated with that glass of water.Many replied saying that they order water to go with their food as it does not contain the added sugar of non-alcoholic drinks.Natalie Palmer tweeted: Why are you assuming it’s because people can’t afford it? It may boggle your mind but some people actually choose to drink water. I can’t drink alcohol (for medical reasons), don’t drink fizzy drinks \u0026amp don’t like juices! All I drink is water!Joseph Murphy added: So you’re saying if I buy a 3 course meal and order water then I’m helping to put you out of business?! Some people don’t want a £7 glass of sugar at dinner. I get that you have to make a profit but you’re being unfair on customers that are spending hard earned money on your food.Oisin Rogers, who runs The Guinea Grill in London, disagreed with Ms Espensen. He told The : I\u0027ve absolutely no problems giving tap water or soda water for free whatsoever. Never have. Sometimes people are just thirsty and it\u0027s a product we offer to everybody, for free. I\u0027m confused and a little dismayed when people who run hospitality businesses criticise their customers for doing what they want to do. We are in the business of making people happy and our businesses should be set up in such a way that when people are happy, we shall turn a little profit.Lots of people who come to me have water with bar snacks, most often at lunchtime. I\u0027m totally ok with this, and I\u0027d never consider criticising a guest for their choice to do this.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. “I had four or five cameras running that morning on that set, and there’s power lines, air lines, that will blow blood everywhere,” he said.“I knew once that happens, the white set will be decimated and will take probably two weeks to clean up. So there was no second take. So I positioned everything the way I felt is going to happen, where it was going to come out. And poor John Hurt was lying strapped down on the table under an artificial chest. And we shot and I honestly had to cross my fingers.”Sex, thugs and shocking roles: The 10 best films of 1969Alien: How Ridley Scott’s masterpiece has stayed relevant for 40 years“The T-shirt didn’t open,” he said. “All there is, is this bump in the T-shirt that flashes out and then it goes away. So I scream, ‘Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!’ And all the actors start laughing, but they’re kind of nervous because they haven’t seen it.“I go back and say, ‘Clear the set!’ They all go off the set. I crawl in on top of John Hurt — poor bugger lying there — and I’m razor-blading the T-shirt so it will pop when the alien hits the back of the T-shirt. We went again. And it was perfect.”chestbuster in \u0027Alien\u0027 (20th Century Fox)In his tribute to\u0026nbspAlien, The Independent’s critic Ed Cumming wrote how\u0026nbspthe original is\u0026nbsp”still the most gripping sci-fi horror ever made“.“Its pacing, with a slow start building to a frenetic climax, is masterful. Its design has held up where more recent films look dated,” he writes.\u0026nbsp“For sci-fi, it depends remarkably little on technology. There are spaceships and weapons and androids, but they are not the main focus. The further we get from the time the film was made, the easier it is to see Alien as an artefact separate from its contemporary technology and the less egregious its clunky computer screens, for example, seem.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scunthorpe was built around steel, not the other way round.”Closing the steelworks would take out a huge amount of wages from the economy. The average steel worker makes £36,000, well above average for the region and the UK as a whole. It would double the local unemployment rate in the region, even before any jobs are inevitably lost in the supply chain.But the impact goes beyond that.\u0026nbspHundreds of local businesses rely on steel indirectly.“My brother has a car garage across the road from the steelworks,” says Ms Childs, who is now a representative for the GMB union.“Most of his customers\u0026nbspwork for British Steel or its contractors. Where is his income going to come from?“There are loads of businesses that are there purposely because of British Steel, like the cafe where the workers can go for a cheeky butty on their break.”Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin is determined to find a resolution that allows workers to keep their jobs. Closure would cause strategic damage to the UK, he said.“This is not just about the core of 4,500 workers that would lose their jobs and not just about those in and around Scunthorpe.“In the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe we are talking about a national strategic asset. To lose that would damage the supply of steel to key industries like defence.“The steel industry is the foundation of manufacturing in this country and vitally important for our economy.”After the UK’s last steelworks closure at\u0026nbspRedcar in 2015, the UK now has just two active blast furnaces – Scunthorpe and Port Talbot in South Wales. They provide some of the highest quality steel in the world.“Once you lose that capability you can’t make your own steel. Are we serious about being a modern, independent nation?” asks Dakin.Such concerns are particularly pertinent at a time of growing nationalism in trade policy with Donald Trump pushing up US tariff barriers and China responding in kind.\u0026nbsp“We would have to import from overseas, where production might be less carbon friendly, the impact on the environment and air quality is higher“You can be held to ransom if you need to import to build important national assets: your railways, ships, planes and whatever else.Ms Childs agrees that the UK will be left in a vulnerable position. “If the Tories abandon manufacturing in the UK, as they seem to be doing, China will one day finish flooding the market with cheap steel and realise that there’s no competition left.”Another thing that\u0026nbspirks is that despite pledges to support steel as part of its industrial strategy, the government undermined it in one important way.When EU steel tariffs were proposed after China began dumping steel onto markets, pushing down prices,\u0026nbspBritain led efforts not to introduce tariffs that would have protected British steel.“It’s fine for the government to talk about an industrial strategy, but what does that actually mean?”Anna Soubry came to visit when steel was facing its last crisis in 2015.“I couldn’t tell you one tangible thing that they did after that.”While many people might want to blame Brexit for the closure, the government must look at its own record, says Ms Childs.“Once the Brexit shambles is over there will still be the same problems and issues that were there before.”British businesses pay twice as much for energy as their French counterparts while business rates are five to 10\u0026nbsptimes as high as on the continent.The experience of Redcar, points to what could befall Scunthorpe if the British Steel plant were allowed to close. Average weekly wages have gone from being some of the highest in the region to amongst the lowest since the steelworks shut.“Redcar knows only too well the cost of a closed steelworks and the impact it has on families, on communities, and on the local economy,” says MP Anna Turley.“Former steelworkers still contact my office needing support.”\u0026nbspBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe site – which is as big as a town in itself – also poses big, and expensive, problems for the environment.Steelworks can leave behind a toxic legacy which presents dangers to the public. Following a plant closure in Corby, Northamptonshire, 19 children were born with deformed feet and hands after their mothers inhaled toxic particles while pregnant during the Eighties\u0026nbspand Nineties.In Redcar, many more millions need to be spent to make the site safe and ready to become productive again.“It’s costing millions every month, and has been for three and a half years, just to keep the site safe,” says Anna Turley.\u0026nbsp“That is before any real clean up work has begun.“The cost of closure is astronomical, especially in comparison to much smaller sums needed to protect the assets, keep them running, and give the business and workforce a future.”The cost of environmental clean-up in Scunthorpe would be “at least” in the hundreds of millions of pounds and would take years, says local MP Nic Dakin – a huge bill that would be footed by taxpayers.“While its operating and it’s safe it’s all an asset but once it stops operating there are some dangerous things there,” he says.Some critics have said that market forces must be allowed to run their course and that the industry is in terminal decline -\u0026nbsp186,000 were employed in UK steel in 1981 compared to just 32,000 last year. Yorkshire and the Humber has already been the worst hit region with 40,000 jobs gone.But there this simplistic story of decline is misleading. Despite little support from the government, the average steel worker has become roughly five times more productive than they were in 1970 a significantly bigger improvement than in the economy as a whole.Given the UK’s current dire level of productivity growth, jettisoning some of the country’s most skilled workers would raise some serious questions.Now that the company has gone into liquidation there are three main options: find a buyer, nationalise or close it down.\u0026nbspThe public broadly supports nationalisation, with 48 per cent of people believing British Steel should be taken back into public ownership compared to just 18 per cent thinking the opposite, according to a new YouGov poll.It reveals that, even among Tory voters, 41 per cent think British Steel should be nationalised compared to 30 per cent who don’t.Nationalisation is the last thing that would have helped British SteelThis leaves a tricky decision for business secretary Greg Clark. Nationalisation of key assets such as the energy and rail networks has been a high-profile element of Labour’s policy platform -\u0026nbsp and one that some Tories have ridiculed.\u0026nbspTo take the British Steel into public ownership could easily be seen as a capitulation or at least an admission that Labour has a point. But to do otherwise could appear heartless. It would also be criticised as\u0026nbspa failure of the government’s industrial strategy, part of which was supposed to be a sector deal to support the steel industry.Clark has said that there are interested private-sector parties but Ms Childs is wary that an “unscrupulous” owner may enter the fray.“We don’t want a buyer that wants to take certain bits of the steel works and discard the rest or charge extortionate rates of interest.\u0026nbsp“We want someone who will take the whole thing and make steel in Scunthorpe for the foreseeable future.”“One thing is for sure” she says. “Through the financial crisis, the 2015 steel crisis and this current crisis, the men and women that work at that plant have always turned up, worked hard and delivered the best steel they can.\u0026nbsp“They will never stop doing that. Unless the gates close for good.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a strong stance against the unregulated, so-called wild-west world of cryptocurrency, and some feared it was an attempt to silence the nascent space. But secretly, the social network was actually planning its own version of the virtual currency.Less than a year after the ban was\u0026nbsplifted, details about what this cryptocurrency might look like have emerged. GlobalCoin, as it is reportedly called, may be about to upend the entire payments industry.The social network, which is used by more than two\u0026nbspbillion people around the world, has sought advice from the Bank of England and US Treasury about how the virtual currency could integrate with existing payment systems.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

This new small team is exploring different applications.How would GlobalCoin work?It is understood that the value of GlobalCoin will be pegged to a handful of established currencies, like the US dollar and euro, in order to avoid the price volatility issues that continue to plague bitcoin.It remains unclear whether Facebook\u0027s cryptocurrency will be decentralised like bitcoin. Industry experts have questioned whether the social network would launch a digital currency that was out of its control, despite advocates considering decentralisation a key tenet\u0026nbspof cryptocurrency.Bitcoin now accepted at Starbucks and dozens of other shopsMark Zuckerberg doesn\u0027t have an idea how to implement it where Facebook doesn\u0027t own it, Phil Chen, who masterminded the HTC Exodus blockchain smartphone, said in March.Cryptocurrencies are open, decentralised, censorship resistant and borderless – this is completely antithetical to the current business model of big technology companies, whose walled gardens mean they essentially own their customers.Facebook is also currently planning a merger of its other social media platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp, meaning GlobalCoin could be transferred between\u0026nbspa variety of apps. Both the merger and the cryptocurrency launch are expected to take place at some point in 2020.Rival messaging apps are also working on their own cryptocurrencies, with Telegram expected to launch its so-called GRAM cryptocurrency later this year.Competing with ChinaOne explanation to why Facebook feels the need to have its own currency lies in a country where Facebook and its various apps aren\u0027t even allowed: China.In order to compete on a global scale with the social networks and messaging apps spreading out of China, its own form of currency could give Facebook the upper hand.Corporate lawyer and fintech expert\u0026nbspTim Bird, who has worked closely with Facebook in the past, said he believed\u0026nbspGlobalCoin\u0026nbspwould give Facebook a new hold over advertising revenues thanks to the massive amounts of data it could generate.Ever since I spent a day working in Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, California, three years ago, it has been evident that they feel the need to challenge China, Bird told\u0026nbspThe Independent.To do this, Facebook needs a currency or payment platform of its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On 19 August, a temporary license granted to Huawei by the US government will expire.Users will also lose\u0026nbspthe ability to install future versions of the Android operating system.“Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally,” a Huawei spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“We will continue to build a\u0026nbspsafe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.”But this will not be the case for future versions of Huawei smartphones, which will lose access to popular Google apps like Maps and YouTube.The suspension will also mean owners of new Huawei phones will not be able to download any apps using the Google Play store.Huawei\u0026nbspsays it has been preparing for this eventuality by building its own technology that is not reliant on US tech giants.Chief executive Richard Yu said in an interview last year that it has a backup plan should it ever be cut off from the likes of Google and Microsoft.Google issues message to Huawei phone owners“We have prepared our own operating system,” he told German publication\u0026nbspDie Welt. “Should it ever happen that we can no longer use these systems, we would be prepared.That’s our plan B but of course we prefer to work with the ecosystems of Google and Microsoft.”After the Trump administration placed Huawei on its “entity list” last week, Huawei executive Ren\u0026nbspZhengfei\u0026nbspreiterated this in comments to Japanese media.“We have already been preparing for this,” he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett reports\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentJoy Division: (left to right) Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter HookIt’s a big year for fans of Joy Division and New Order. This summer marks 40 years since the former’s debut album Unknown Pleasures, their only LP released before the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis, aged 23, in May 1980. The surviving members – bassist Hook, guitarist Bernard “Barney” Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris – transformed themselves into New Order that year, joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards, with Sumner taking over vocals. It’s 30 years since the band released Technique. It was their their fifth album, but the one that propelled them to the top of the charts and into proper stardom, influenced by the Balearic sound of house music.Everybody, it seems, has a Joy Division or New Order story to tell, as evidenced by the books released this year. Jon Savage’s This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is an “oral history” of Joy Division, published by Faber in April. Drummer Stephen Morris has his memoirs, Record Play Pause, out this month. Dave Haslam, one-time DJ at Manchester’s Hacienda club, the focal point of the so-called Madchester scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, mentions his love of both bands in his recent autobiography, Sonic Youth Slept On My Floor.“Hooky”, you might be unsurprised to hear, doesn’t have a lot of truck with any of them. We meet in a Costa in Alderley Edge, a leafy little town in Cheshire, only 20 miles away, geographically, from Salford, where Hooky and Bernard Sumner grew up, but half a world away in other respects.He’s lived here for 20 years, and as we find a quiet corner of the coffee shop, I mention in passing that I took my 14-year-old daughter to listen to Haslam reading from his book a few weeks ago. “Well, when she grows up she’ll never forgive you,” he says.Created with Sketch.Caught on film: Joy Division on tour in 1979 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hooky perhaps has a reputation for abrasiveness, for speaking his mind, for not taking any crap. He and New Order parted ways in 2007 and don’t appear to be on good terms. I mention that Haslam had spoken fondly of him, which he finds hard to believe. Has he read Haslam’s book?“I haven’t read many good Manchester books,” he says. “I think my favourite is Bez’s. I’ve got Mark E Smith’s on my shelf but not got round to it yet.”Peter Hook to perform Joy Division albums in full at UK showsJoy Division’s Bernard Sumner’s memoir recalls the death of bandmateHooky himself wrote Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division, published in 2012, and he says he did so as a direct response to the author and journalist Mick Middles’ 1996 book, From Joy Division to New Order. “That Middles book was a crock of f**king shit but he inspired me to write my own,” he says. “I suppose I’m in the unenviable position of being too close to the whole thing.”I wave Jon Savage’s book at him and he shakes his head. “That is particularly annoying that one, it’s Joy Division in their own words but a lot of it’s just lifted from when we did the Joy Division documentary. Those interviews were from the Control interview, Faber bought them lock stock and barrel without our permission, without even a f**king charity donation. He had access to the whole transcripts. Didn’t make sense to me, especially from Jon Savage who you’ve known for 40 f**king years. We weren’t party to how it was done in any way shape or form so it’s just another annoyance.”Does a lot of stuff annoy Peter Hook generally? He shrugs. “It’s not that bad after a while. You just get used to it. You get to that bit where nothing surprises you. I mean, I’ve had a few fracas with Jon because he sided with them lot and excluded me which I felt was really unfair, especially when I used to tow his f**king car back so our kid could fix it. So yeah… people have short memories.”There’s a chapter in Dave Haslam’s book where he details being commissioned by NME to interview New Order, a band of which he describes himself as “a devotee, bewitched by them”. Haslam interviewed the band in 1986 at their recording studio in Cheetham Hill afterwards, Hooky gave him a lift back into Manchester city centre. Haslam had taped the interview but something went wrong his tape was blank. In a panic, he sat down in a cafe and tried to write down everything again from memory, commenting:\u0026nbsp“No one knew how I’d crafted the quotes by New Order.”Tales grow in the telling. Legends get embellished. Stories take on a life of their own. “Yeah,” concedes Hooky. In 2010 he wrote a book called The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club, and says he initially wanted to do it on interviews with the principal characters. “What I found which was really weird, when I started talking to a few people I very quickly realised that everybody had a different memory of the single occasion, so I thought f**k this, I’m going to have to do it on my own. And you find even though you think something is true you can be contradicted by people.”As an example, Hooky cites his auctioning off earlier this year of all his old Joy Division and New Order memorabilia, to raise money for the Epilepsy Society (Ian Curtis suffered from it) and Calm, the charity aimed at tackling suicide, especially among men. He put a bell tree percussion device in the lots, saying it had been used on the Joy Division track Atmosphere. Drummer Stephen Morris, who would have used it, disputed the fact.Hooky says, “I think you’d have to be deaf not to realise that a bell tree made the sound and it wasn’t a tambourine stuck on a pair of scissors. But that is an example of how people can remember completely different things. Normally it doesn’t lead to that level of aggro but it is quite shocking really because there is no truth, the only truth really is your truth. You’re not gonna lie. I’m sure Stephen Morris thinks it was but, y’know, in my opinion he’s wrong, and you have to go with your own truth otherwise you’d never get through life. It is interesting the way you can have completely different ideas.”V97 with Monaco (PA)There’s a sense when talking to Peter Hook that his often cutting remarks about the people he’s shared some of the last 40-odd years with are, in a way, a defensive tactic, that there’s been so many wars of words since New Order split that he’s getting his jabs in first. At one point I ask him what would happen if Bernard Sumner walked into the Costa we were sitting in, and he laughs uproariously and says, “You’d need your camera, mate!”But it’s obvious he loves the music. He’s rarely been without a band or project since he started while New Order were still going he worked with another Factory band, Ad Infinitum. When New Order had their first break-up in 1993, he started two new bands, Revenge and Monaco. New Order reformed for almost a decade from 1998, during which time Hooky began to develop his DJing career, which now sees him about to embark on a tour with Hacienda Classical, kicking off on 8 June at Scarborough’s Open Air Theatre.Classical accompaniment to pop and dance music is something of a thing right now, but this is the fifth year of the Hacienda Classical concept, which combines the live orchestral music of the Manchester Camerata with DJs recreating the sounds of the nightclub’s heyday. If you think that sounds a bit weird, then you wouldn’t be on your own.Camerata Orchestra performing Hacienda Classical (Rex)The idea had been pioneered by DJ Todd Terry in the States, and British DJ Pete Tong had started doing it over here. “Pete Tong was doing it more as a concert, songs finishing and starting. Graeme’s idea was to do it as a DJ mix, just the same as it would be in a club, so once you started you didn’t stop,” says Hooky.That caused some problems with some venues because they wanted an intermission in which to make up the takings on the bar. “But we felt it was more intrinsic to the spirit of the Hacienda to be complete it starts and it finishes, you’re f**ked and you go home and you recover. It was that depth of feeling that you wanted from what we were doing.”The orchestra plays live and the sound is mixed by the DJ in to the classic Hacienda club tracks, with live vocalists. Hooky gets a bit of fire in his eyes that’s impossible to fake just for PR purposes as he waxes lyrical over the gigs. “A lot of these songs you’ve grown up with and they’ve marked many, many special occasions in your life… death, kids, meeting the missus, losing the missus … it’s very charged, it’s very physical, and people f**king love it. And it gives all us old people the excuse to live our youth again, get a babysitter, have the kids tucked up at home, and fearing what you’re going to feel like the next morning.”Hooky started DJing in 2004, doing it full time in 2007 when New Order split for the second time. He says, “I started doing it out of necessity because I had no money at that point, as New Order we’d not worked for a bit. I mainly do dance music and I get in a lot of trouble because everybody expects you to play the f**king Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays ad infinitum.Madchester’ hub\u0026nbsp(Rex)“The other fantastic thing is most DJs are sober and they’re always on time, which is f**king fantastic. If I’m on at 9 o’clock I know the DJ before me will finish at 8.59.59. You play with groups and they’re always f**king late, nobody arguing about who goes on last and all that crap. It’s very courteous. The rivalry comes with you wanting to play a better set.”So he’s looking forward to hitting the road with the Hacienda Classical Tour, which takes in the Royal Albert Hall and the Isle of Wight Festival among its dates. But Hooky has a special soft spot for the tour opener, Scarborough.“Scarborough is a great place,” he enthuses. “I DJ’d in that old place on the pier the last time I was there. They were nuts. And I never realised how beautiful Scarborough was. Scarborough actually reminded me insanely of Palma, Majorca. I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. All that European money, innit? And they won’t be getting that any more.”Ah, here it is. We look at each other cautiously over our coffee cups. Ageing rock stars and Brexit. You never know how that one’s going to pan out, do you? Morrissey calling the referendum result “magnificent” and Johnny Rotten in a “make America great again” T-shirt.“Look,” says Hooky, who lives in Majorca for half the year and has ambitions to do that full-time. “I’m a traveller. I go all round the world all the time and I do think it’s important in this day and age for us all to stick together, and not to be fragmented. I think that’s the worst thing that could happen to anybody and I think it exacerbates differences and things like immigration and racism.“I just think it’s the wrong way of pursuing a modern life. It’s old-fashioned, and honestly if you found someone who still thought it was a good idea then they’re a f**king idiot because it’s been proved that our government can’t handle it, which is an embarrassment. I was sat there last week doing a Euro news interview and the guy’s going, ‘What’s happening with Brexit?’ and I haven’t a f**king clue but there’s one thing I do know that if I was doing my job as shit as them I’d be stood on me own in a concert hall. There’d be no audience, right, and that’s what makes me laugh about it. Our government is selfish, it’s only interested in power, personal power, personal politics, and the country is just an absolute f**king embarrassment.”He pauses, then shakes his head and adds, “David Cameron should be torn apart by an angry mob. Theresa May had\u0026nbspthe balls to try to stay in office and say I’ll see it out, not like that shithouse.”Though DJing with the Hacienda Classical tour will dominate this summer, Hooky does of course still keep his bass arm working, primarily with Peter Hook and The Light. That started in 2010, around the 30th anniversaryof Ian Curtis’s death, the same year he opened a new nightclub, The Factory, in the old\u0026nbspoffices of Factory Records\u0026nbspin Manchester. The Light performs Joy Division and New Order tracks, as they were meant to be heard, faithfully following the order of the songs on the albums.“I literally only booked one gig, which was at The Factory, and it was supposed to be a one-off celebration and we ended up doing two nights and we started getting loads of interest,” he recalls. “We hadn’t booked anything until we played, it all came out as a result of that and it was wonderful. I’d not played Joy Division songs for 30 years ... to actually start playing them was absolutely fantastic because we hardly ever did them as New Order.”According to Hooky, New Order “buried Joy Division along with Ian”, and they would only very occasionally revisit the old stuff, such as when manager Rob Gretton asked them to play Love Will Tear Us Apart “because it’s f**king so-and-so’s birthday”. He says, “I think we played in our whole career of New Order about three Joy Division songs.”That changed in 2006 when New Order played the first Manchester Versus Cancer gig, an initiative set up by Andy Rourke of The Smiths. They played a full set of Joy Division tunes. “It was absolutely fantastic, it was delightful, absolutely delightful to do,” says Hooky. “But I don’t think Barney liked doing it and I understand that. He wanted to do his own lyrics, he wanted to do his own songs, which makes perfect sense. But it was a frustration, because you’re sort of given something back for a moment and then it’s snatched off you again.But Hooky had developed a taste for performing the Joy Division songs he hadn’t played for 30 years, and The Light was born. In May 2020 The Light will perform the two Joy Division albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in full, at the Manchester Apollo and the Brixton Academy. Again, they will be benefiting the Epilepsy Society and Calm. It will be 40 years, almost to the day, since Ian Curtis died.Without taking anything away from any of the musicians Hooky has worked with (his own son Jack has played with Monaco and The Light), I wonder if it wouldn’t just be simpler – and more satisfying for fans – to get the old band back together again to play these classic songs?We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?Hooky thinks for a long moment before musing, “With any group you’re always going to get a problem if the members of the group don’t get on. Look at The Smiths the only two that make most money out of it are Morrissey and Marr. It’s a great shame.”I wonder out loud what The Smiths would be like if they were still together as a band today. Hooky looks at me. “Well, what would New Order be like if they were going today?”And could that be a thing?“What happened at the end of New Order was that Bernard and I had completely different ideas about the group, the music, the attitude to business, and they were that far apart,” he says holding his hands wide. “And the only thing in the middle was Stephen. I had the opinion that Steve agreed with me and then found out afterwards that he seemed to agree with Bernard so I’m looking forward to his book for an explanation of that.“Then they reformed behind my back, and licensed the assets to themselves. Which is not exactly the most honourable thing to do but...” He shrugs. “It’s survival.”There was a long-running court case over Hook’s claim of lost royalties after the band’s “restructuring”, which was settled out of court in 2017. Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert continue under the name New Order.Three decades since Technique, 40 years since Unknown Pleasures. Next year will be the 40th anniversary\u0026nbspof Ian Curtis’s death. Is there any change of a reconciliation on the horizon at all? Over the course of the interview, Hooky seems to have mellowed away from his initial defensive-offensive tactic of getting his attacks in first, albeit done with wry humour as they were. Now he seems almost reflective.“You asked me earlier what would happen if Barney walked in here,” he says. “We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood.

The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab wrote that the cast – including Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Steve Buscemi – gave strangely listless and deadpan performances. The two-star review continued: Tilda Swinton brings some comic vim to her role as a samurai-like undertaker with a broad Scottish accent while Caleb Landry Jones and Danny Glover are good value as they take a stand against the undead in the local convenience store, but neither the satire nor the slapstick here are as sharp as you would like them to be.Dexter Fletcher’s Elton John biopic Rocketman had its world premiere at Cannes. While The  awarded the film with five stars, most other publications were more muted. The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab called the film a rousing and emotional affair with an operatic sweep. However, he added: At times, Rocketman risks turning into a chronicle of woe. Much of the film focuses on the years when Elton was abusing alcohol and drugs. He was miserable in his own life and took out his unhappiness on those closest to him. This doesn’t make him very good company. It can become tiresome to hear him say yet again how much he hates himself. However, Fletcher films even the darkest scenes in a very flamboyant fashion and manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour.Ken Loach, two-time winner of the Palme d\u0027Or, returned to the festival with Sorry We Missed You. Late in his career, Loach retains the ability to make heart-wrenching and very topical dramas that expose the grimmer aspects of contemporary British society, wrote Geoffrey Macnab in a five-star review for The Independent. Scripted by his regular collaborator Paul Laverty, this is another of Loach’s films about decent people trying to do the best for themselves but being defeated by a system in which \u0027everything is out of whack.\u0027 Other publications were equally positive about the film.420 Pain and GloryGeoffrey Macnab described Pedro Almodóvar\u0027s Pain and Glory as the kind of indulgent and self-absorbed film that only a director with such a glittering career behind him would be allowed to get away with. The four-star review continued: It’s about a filmmaker looking back on his past, mulling over his life and relationships. Imagine a Spanish version of a Bergman or Woody Allen film about love and loss and you will come close to its essence. It’s a wonderfully evocative affair with a subtle, soulful performance from Antonio Banderas.520 Once Upon a Time in HollywoodProbably the biggest film of the festival, Quentin Tarantino\u0027s Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, was met with almost unanimous praise. Quite simply, I just defy anyone with red blood in their veins not to respond to the crazy bravura of Tarantino’s film-making, not to be bounced around the auditorium at the moment-by-moment enjoyment that this movie delivers – and conversely, of course, to shudder at the horror and cruelty and its hallucinatory aftermath, wrote Peter Bradshaw in , awarding the film full marks. Variety was slightly more damning, with Owen Gleiberman writing: By the end, Tarantino has done something that’s quintessentially Tarantino, but that no longer feels even vaguely revolutionary. He has reduced the story he’s telling to pulp.Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson star in Robert Eggers\u0027s follow-up to The Witch. Titled The Lighthouse, the two-header won over critics, with both The  and  awarding the film five stars. The film is shot in inky black and white, on grainy 35mm film, and presented in a series of rigorously composed square frames, wrote Kevin Maher in The Times. It has the feel of a newly discovered artefact from FW Murnau (Nosferatu) and is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking movies at the festival. If it has a palpable flaw, it’s that the style sometimes overwhelms. More head than heart. The final image is so breathtaking, however, that you can forgive even this.Bong Joon-ho was last at Cannes with the Netflix film Okja. His return with Parasite was met with critical acclaim. Peter Bradshaw of  described the film as a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama. He added: It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho. Parasite is a bizarre black comedy about social status, aspiration, materialism and the patriarchal family unit, and people who accept the idea of having (or leasing) a servant class.Director Ladj Ly\u0027s debut turned heads at Cannes. Nicholas Barber of the BBC wrote that the racially charged urban drama about the hostility between police and civilians is impressive but lost momentum in the middle. However, Barber concluded: Just when you think that the story is drifting towards an obvious ending, there is an explosion of savage action which, although highly implausible, is so shocking, exciting and politically fascinating that it blasts the film into a different level.920 Portrait of a Lady on FireFew films received praise equal to Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The film website IndieWire awarded French filmmaker Céline Sciamma\u0027s film an A grade. Critic David Ehrlich wrote: “Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a profoundly tender story about the process of self-discovery and becoming... The film is paced at the speed of a world that’s lit by candlelight, the sex is sensual without being provocative, and the third act will frustrate anyone hoping for a more radical takedown of heteronormative structures.Russian talent Kantemir Balagov may be just 27 years old, but the director has already won over critics from across the world. The first sounds, over the black of the opening titles, are of tiny, gasping breaths catching in a throat, wrote Variety\u0027s Jessica Kiang of Balagov\u0027s second feature film. It could be a death rattle or an asthma attack or the last throes of a strangulation, but it is undoubtedly a human in distress. And it’s a very close analogy for how Beanpole, the slow, ferocious, and extraordinary film from Balagov, can make you feel. You quite often have to remind yourself to breathe.French-Senegalese director Mati Diop was the first black female director to ever compete for the Palme d’Or. Her film, Atlantics, won positive reviews, with Screenrant\u0027s Allan Hunter writing: Constantly intriguing, Atlantics successfully blends its disparate elements of love story, ghost story and female empowerment into a distinctive, involving drama.Danielle Lessovitz\u0027s Port Authority went down well with audiences. The Hollywood Reporter described the film as a boy-meets-trans girl romance about identity and belonging around the New York underground ballroom scene. Their critic David Rooney wrote of the film: There\u0027s a disarming gentleness to Port Authority, echoed in composer Matthew Herbert\u0027s subtle score, that makes this story of love, family and self-discovery quite satisfying.Diao Yinan\u0027s first film since Black Coal, which won the Golden Bear at Berlin Film Festical in 2014, received mixed reviews. Peter Bradshaw wrote in the  that The Wild Goose Lake is a movie showcasing similar flourishes of brilliance, violent impacts and setpiece bravura – but also some of the same slightly stolid, opaque style that made me a little agnostic about that 2014 hit. One fan was Tarantino himself who is reported to have cried at the film\u0027s premiere.Another directing debut, this one from French actor and screenwriter Maryam Touzani. The Hollywood Reporter\u0027s Deborah Young described Adam as a bright addition to Cannes\u0027 Un Certain Regard section. She added: With great delicacy, Touzani shows how Moroccan society censures a woman who gives birth outside marriage — not a terribly original theme, but here it is made heartrending by the superb performances of Lubna Azabal and Nisrin Erradi in the lead roles.Michael Angelo Covino\u0027s debut The Climb, described as depicting a bromance by numerous outlets, was met by rave reviews. The Climb is a fantastic film about frenemies, bringing craft and intelligence to what easily could have been a hackneyed, boring bit of cringe comedy, wrote Jason Gorber for SlashFilm. Instead there’s genuine heart at the connection between these two, foolish and friendly and flawed in equal measure. With bravura cinematic flourishes that never get in the way of the character moments, this remarkable film clambers its way into your heart as you find yourself rooting even for these decidedly awkward iniduals.Corneliu Porumboiu\u0027s noir suspense thriller The Whistlers was compared to Neil Jordan’s Mona Lisa and Orson Welles’ The Lady from Shanghai by \u0027s Peter Bradshaw. Porumboiu gives us a knotty, twisty, nifty plot that’s quite involved but hangs together well, and there’s an amusing juxtaposition of gloomy, rainy Bucharest and the sunny terrain of La Gomera, he continued. We also get a neat and unexpected coda. An elegant and stylishly crafted piece of entertainment.1720 Joan of Arc (Jeanne)Bruno Dumont\u0027s sequel to Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc, simply titled Joan of Arc, received equally as negative reviews as its 2017 predecessor. Enthusiasts of the prolific Dumont will surely get something out of this latest effort — as perhaps will Joan of Arc movie adaptation completists, wrote Jordan Mintzer in The Hollywood Reporter. But beyond that niche, many will find watching the 137-minute movie akin to being burnt at the stake.The Dardenne brothers\u0027 latest effort, a taut study of a devout 13-year-old Muslim, marked a rare misfire for the directing duo. On the aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film sits – following the festival screening – as their lowest rated work yet. Charles Bramesco of Little White Lies wrote: The Dardennes have often settled on not-knowing in their work, only here, that acceptance of uncertainty plays like a concession that they\u0027re in over their heads.Despite starring Isabelle Huppert, Ira Sachs\u0027 Frankie has ided critics like no other film at the festival. Whereas  awarded the film a squalid one star, The Hollywood Reporter called Huppert magnetic in the starring role. IndieWire concluded: It\u0027s like an elegant bracelet that\u0027s modest enough to go unnoticed, but nevertheless reveals a quietly exquisite beauty to those who are willing to lean in and look closer (even if they have to squint).Terrence Malick made his return to Cannes with A Hidden Life. While critics have been harsh on the director\u0027s more recent works, he\u0027s impressed many with his latest effort. It may not have the stellar Hollywood casts of his last couple of films, but it has the driving sense of purpose, wrote Nicholas Barber for the BBC. It even has a proper screenplay, instead of hours of sleepy improvisation. The fact that it is gorgeous to look at is a bonus.Jim Jarmusch\u0027s The Dead Don\u0027t Die opened Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews. The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab wrote that the cast – including Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Steve Buscemi – gave strangely listless and deadpan performances. The two-star review continued: Tilda Swinton brings some comic vim to her role as a samurai-like undertaker with a broad Scottish accent while Caleb Landry Jones and Danny Glover are good value as they take a stand against the undead in the local convenience store, but neither the satire nor the slapstick here are as sharp as you would like them to be.Dexter Fletcher’s Elton John biopic Rocketman had its world premiere at Cannes. While The  awarded the film with five stars, most other publications were more muted. The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab called the film a rousing and emotional affair with an operatic sweep. However, he added: At times, Rocketman risks turning into a chronicle of woe. Much of the film focuses on the years when Elton was abusing alcohol and drugs. He was miserable in his own life and took out his unhappiness on those closest to him. This doesn’t make him very good company. It can become tiresome to hear him say yet again how much he hates himself. However, Fletcher films even the darkest scenes in a very flamboyant fashion and manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour.Ken Loach, two-time winner of the Palme d\u0027Or, returned to the festival with Sorry We Missed You. Late in his career, Loach retains the ability to make heart-wrenching and very topical dramas that expose the grimmer aspects of contemporary British society, wrote Geoffrey Macnab in a five-star review for The Independent. Scripted by his regular collaborator Paul Laverty, this is another of Loach’s films about decent people trying to do the best for themselves but being defeated by a system in which \u0027everything is out of whack.\u0027 Other publications were equally positive about the film.420 Pain and GloryGeoffrey Macnab described Pedro Almodóvar\u0027s Pain and Glory as the kind of indulgent and self-absorbed film that only a director with such a glittering career behind him would be allowed to get away with. The four-star review continued: It’s about a filmmaker looking back on his past, mulling over his life and relationships. Imagine a Spanish version of a Bergman or Woody Allen film about love and loss and you will come close to its essence. It’s a wonderfully evocative affair with a subtle, soulful performance from Antonio Banderas.520 Once Upon a Time in HollywoodProbably the biggest film of the festival, Quentin Tarantino\u0027s Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, was met with almost unanimous praise. Quite simply, I just defy anyone with red blood in their veins not to respond to the crazy bravura of Tarantino’s film-making, not to be bounced around the auditorium at the moment-by-moment enjoyment that this movie delivers – and conversely, of course, to shudder at the horror and cruelty and its hallucinatory aftermath, wrote Peter Bradshaw in , awarding the film full marks. Variety was slightly more damning, with Owen Gleiberman writing: By the end, Tarantino has done something that’s quintessentially Tarantino, but that no longer feels even vaguely revolutionary. He has reduced the story he’s telling to pulp.Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson star in Robert Eggers\u0027s follow-up to The Witch. Titled The Lighthouse, the two-header won over critics, with both The  and  awarding the film five stars. The film is shot in inky black and white, on grainy 35mm film, and presented in a series of rigorously composed square frames, wrote Kevin Maher in The Times. It has the feel of a newly discovered artefact from FW Murnau (Nosferatu) and is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking movies at the festival. If it has a palpable flaw, it’s that the style sometimes overwhelms. More head than heart. The final image is so breathtaking, however, that you can forgive even this.Bong Joon-ho was last at Cannes with the Netflix film Okja. His return with Parasite was met with critical acclaim. Peter Bradshaw of  described the film as a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama. He added: It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho. Parasite is a bizarre black comedy about social status, aspiration, materialism and the patriarchal family unit, and people who accept the idea of having (or leasing) a servant class.Director Ladj Ly\u0027s debut turned heads at Cannes. Nicholas Barber of the BBC wrote that the racially charged urban drama about the hostility between police and civilians is impressive but lost momentum in the middle. However, Barber concluded: Just when you think that the story is drifting towards an obvious ending, there is an explosion of savage action which, although highly implausible, is so shocking, exciting and politically fascinating that it blasts the film into a different level.920 Portrait of a Lady on FireFew films received praise equal to Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The film website IndieWire awarded French filmmaker Céline Sciamma\u0027s film an A grade. Critic David Ehrlich wrote: “Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a profoundly tender story about the process of self-discovery and becoming... The film is paced at the speed of a world that’s lit by candlelight, the sex is sensual without being provocative, and the third act will frustrate anyone hoping for a more radical takedown of heteronormative structures.Russian talent Kantemir Balagov may be just 27 years old, but the director has already won over critics from across the world. The first sounds, over the black of the opening titles, are of tiny, gasping breaths catching in a throat, wrote Variety\u0027s Jessica Kiang of Balagov\u0027s second feature film. It could be a death rattle or an asthma attack or the last throes of a strangulation, but it is undoubtedly a human in distress. And it’s a very close analogy for how Beanpole, the slow, ferocious, and extraordinary film from Balagov, can make you feel. You quite often have to remind yourself to breathe.French-Senegalese director Mati Diop was the first black female director to ever compete for the Palme d’Or. Her film, Atlantics, won positive reviews, with Screenrant\u0027s Allan Hunter writing: Constantly intriguing, Atlantics successfully blends its disparate elements of love story, ghost story and female empowerment into a distinctive, involving drama.Danielle Lessovitz\u0027s Port Authority went down well with audiences. The Hollywood Reporter described the film as a boy-meets-trans girl romance about identity and belonging around the New York underground ballroom scene. Their critic David Rooney wrote of the film: There\u0027s a disarming gentleness to Port Authority, echoed in composer Matthew Herbert\u0027s subtle score, that makes this story of love, family and self-discovery quite satisfying.Diao Yinan\u0027s first film since Black Coal, which won the Golden Bear at Berlin Film Festical in 2014, received mixed reviews. Peter Bradshaw wrote in the  that The Wild Goose Lake is a movie showcasing similar flourishes of brilliance, violent impacts and setpiece bravura – but also some of the same slightly stolid, opaque style that made me a little agnostic about that 2014 hit. One fan was Tarantino himself who is reported to have cried at the film\u0027s premiere.Another directing debut, this one from French actor and screenwriter Maryam Touzani. The Hollywood Reporter\u0027s Deborah Young described Adam as a bright addition to Cannes\u0027 Un Certain Regard section. She added: With great delicacy, Touzani shows how Moroccan society censures a woman who gives birth outside marriage — not a terribly original theme, but here it is made heartrending by the superb performances of Lubna Azabal and Nisrin Erradi in the lead roles.Michael Angelo Covino\u0027s debut The Climb, described as depicting a bromance by numerous outlets, was met by rave reviews. The Climb is a fantastic film about frenemies, bringing craft and intelligence to what easily could have been a hackneyed, boring bit of cringe comedy, wrote Jason Gorber for SlashFilm. Instead there’s genuine heart at the connection between these two, foolish and friendly and flawed in equal measure. With bravura cinematic flourishes that never get in the way of the character moments, this remarkable film clambers its way into your heart as you find yourself rooting even for these decidedly awkward iniduals.Corneliu Porumboiu\u0027s noir suspense thriller The Whistlers was compared to Neil Jordan’s Mona Lisa and Orson Welles’ The Lady from Shanghai by \u0027s Peter Bradshaw. Porumboiu gives us a knotty, twisty, nifty plot that’s quite involved but hangs together well, and there’s an amusing juxtaposition of gloomy, rainy Bucharest and the sunny terrain of La Gomera, he continued. We also get a neat and unexpected coda. An elegant and stylishly crafted piece of entertainment.1720 Joan of Arc (Jeanne)Bruno Dumont\u0027s sequel to Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc, simply titled Joan of Arc, received equally as negative reviews as its 2017 predecessor. Enthusiasts of the prolific Dumont will surely get something out of this latest effort — as perhaps will Joan of Arc movie adaptation completists, wrote Jordan Mintzer in The Hollywood Reporter. But beyond that niche, many will find watching the 137-minute movie akin to being burnt at the stake.The Dardenne brothers\u0027 latest effort, a taut study of a devout 13-year-old Muslim, marked a rare misfire for the directing duo. On the aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film sits – following the festival screening – as their lowest rated work yet. Charles Bramesco of Little White Lies wrote: The Dardennes have often settled on not-knowing in their work, only here, that acceptance of uncertainty plays like a concession that they\u0027re in over their heads.Despite starring Isabelle Huppert, Ira Sachs\u0027 Frankie has ided critics like no other film at the festival. Whereas  awarded the film a squalid one star, The Hollywood Reporter called Huppert magnetic in the starring role. IndieWire concluded: It\u0027s like an elegant bracelet that\u0027s modest enough to go unnoticed, but nevertheless reveals a quietly exquisite beauty to those who are willing to lean in and look closer (even if they have to squint).Terrence Malick made his return to Cannes with A Hidden Life. While critics have been harsh on the director\u0027s more recent works, he\u0027s impressed many with his latest effort. It may not have the stellar Hollywood casts of his last couple of films, but it has the driving sense of purpose, wrote Nicholas Barber for the BBC. It even has a proper screenplay, instead of hours of sleepy improvisation. The fact that it is gorgeous to look at is a bonus.\u0026nbspThe festival’s second-place award, the Grand Prize, went to French-Senegalese director Mati Diop’s\u0026nbspAtlantique​. Diop was the first black female director in competition at Cannes.\u0026nbspWhat the critics are saying about Cannes festival’s top filmsBelgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne shared the best director for Young Ahmed.Best actor went to Antonio Banderas for Pedro Almodovar’s Pain and Glory,\u0026nbspwhile best actress was won by British actress Emily Beecham for Little Joe.Celine Sciamma’s period romance Portrait of a Lady on Fire\u0026nbspwas the Palme pick for many critics this year, but it ended up with best screenplay.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the festival’s 72-year history, only one woman has won the top prize.

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Has argued that a no-deal exit would reflect the result of the 2016 referendum. The\u0026nbspformer mayor of London\u0026nbspwas once seen as the “Heineken candidate” capable of reaching voters other Tories could not. But his star has waned among Tory\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspleft unimpressed by his two years as foreign secretary.\u0026nbspHis popularity among Tory activists would give him a strong chance of winning if he made the final shortlist, but he might be blocked by a determined “stop Boris” campaign already being planned by his critics. If successful, the move would anger many Tory activists.Leadsom’s\u0026nbspleadership hopes have been revived (Getty)Resigned from the cabinet on the eve of the European elections, saying she no longer believed the government’s approach would deliver the Brexit referendum result the people voted for.She showed her inexperience in the 2016 leadership election, withdrawing to leave May as the last candidate standing after making comments appearing to suggest\u0026nbspshe would make a better leader because she had children.Javid is one of the frontrunners to replace Theresa May (Jack TaylorGetty)Backed Remain in 2016 referendum despite his Eurosceptic instincts. Now a keen Brexiteer, and prepared to keep a no-deal exit on the table. Has consistently challenged\u0026nbspMay in cabinet meetings.Ambitious and has a brilliant backstory as the son of Pakistani bus driver who came to the UK with £1 in his pocket. But appears to be suffering from the curse of being one of the frontrunners in the Tory race. His stock has fallen recently after what some MPs see as unforced errors such as his handling of\u0026nbspmigrants crossing the English channel and his decision to strip Isis schoolgirl Shamima Begum of her UK citizenship.Remainer who briefly supported a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal after the 2016 vote. Now rejects the idea, and is seen as a born-again Brexiteer who also wants to keep a no-deal departure on the table.His pitch would be as the candidate who could unite the Tories’ warring factions. Tory members might judge him too much of a Remainer. Critics worry that his long stint as\u0026nbsphealth secretary\u0026nbspcould return to haunt him at a general election. Could benefit from a slide in Javid’s fortunes, but will not want to overtake him to become\u0026nbspthe frontrunner.Along with Johnson, headed the victorious Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. Even his critics admit he is one of the few successful departmental ministers since his surprise return to May’s cabinet in 2017, a year after she sacked him.Has been a loyal and articulate promoter of the withdrawal agreement. Critics see this as in part an attempt to shed his reputation as an assassin who turned on\u0026nbspJohnson\u0026nbspto run for the leadership in 2016.Gove’s\u0026nbsprefusal to join other Brexiteers in resigning from the cabinet might count against him among\u0026nbspEurosceptics. However, many of them are now coming round to his strategy of getting the deal “over the line” to save Brexit.Eurosceptic former chief of staff to David Davis, and followed his path by becoming and then resigning as Brexit secretary, complaining he was kept out of the loop by May and her civil service negotiator Olly Robbins. Displayed a grip on the detail while in the job, and impressed May allies in the 2016 referendum when he campaigned for Leave.\u0026nbspBut did not impress Brussels officials.A fresh face, although his relative lack of cabinet experience could count against him. But a\u0026nbspdark horse to watch in a leadership race. Has a big decision to make: will he back May’s deal if Johnson\u0026nbspdoes, or decide to have clean hands and oppose it to the end, and potentially be on the losing side?A new entrant in the leadership race and, at 40, could be the youngest candidate. A rare breed in the May government as a survivor of David Cameron’s regime: before becoming an MP in 2010, he was chief of staff to George Osborne. Impressed as culture secretary, as one of the few UK politicians to understand the digital era and power of the internet giants. Has also shown grip in a testing job since his promotion to health and social care secretary.Smooth media performer who does not lack ambition. Described by some MPs as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”, he is Remainer-turned-Leaver who could unite his fractious party. Has gone into bat for May’s deal when others kept their head down. Could be part of a “stop Boris” drive in which Johnson’s rivals try to share out MPs’ votes to keep him off the shortlist. Seen by some Tories as the leader after next.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This partisan thing completely passes me by and, when I look across Europe, they seem to do pretty well with coalitions.“I don\u0027t know what the format will be, but will we be singing from the same hymn sheet?

Of course we are, because everybody\u0027s different. But do we all agree that the long goal is something centrist together?

Here’s everything you need to know about them.What is the vote for?The European Parliament is one of the EU’s institutions, and it’s democratically elected by all 28 member states. Because the UK hasn’t left yet, it will also elect MEPs – 73 of the total 751.\u0026nbspBecause of its large population UK elects the third most MEPs after any country, with Germany (96) and France (74) electing the most.What do the elections decide?They’ll decide the composition of the European Parliament, which has to pass EU laws and scrutinises the activities of the EU. The Parliament also plays a role in choosing the next European Commission president – the EU’s executive. They’ll replace the current president, Jean-Claude Juncker, after a negotiations between the parliament and member state governments.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThis also means the result will be roughly proportional to the votes cast, so every vote potentially counts towards the final result. Smaller parties will get representation too, unlike at Westminster.\u0026nbspEach UK party is also affiliated with a wider European group – so Labour sit in the socialist group, the Liberal Democrats sit in a pan-European liberal alliance, etc.Will this affect Brexit?The results won’t directly affect Brexit – MEPs don’t really have actual input into the Brexit process. Indirectly, some voters may choose to use the elections to send a message to other parties about their Brexit policies, if they are so inclined.Who is going to win?The polls show the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage’s outfit, well ahead of the other parties, with the vast majority of surveys showing Labour in a clear second place and others behind.When this all happening?The UK voted on Thursday – though other countries vote on slightly different days, as different states prefer to have their elections on specific days of the week.The results will be sealed until polls close in the last member states, at 10pm UK time on the Sunday evening, when final counting will start. The results are expected shortly after that throughout the night, though some member states might take longer.\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland and the Scottish isles also do not count on a Sunday, so their results will come on Monday, when the full picture will start to emerge.How do I vote?You should have already registered to vote by now. If you have, you should be sent a polling card with instructions of where to go on Thursday to cast your ballot.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Westminster chaos is not his doing.The stalwart Leave campaigner is the brightest and best-informed MEP we have. The Brexit vote might have been lost without him.But Hannan may too be swept away by the tide.

That’s a tall order.The second is to probe why private firm Greybull, which bought it for £, presides over so many corporate disasters.But under EU rules the Government cannot pour state aid directly into a failing business. Nor should it.It should spend millions instead retraining those workers and funding tax breaks to lure new firms to Scunthorpe.Admittedly, that would require a coherent industrial strategy Britain lacks.But the Tories must not abandon this community whose livelihoods are at risk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Treachery amid the herbaceous borders.Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned at the stitch-up because vicar’s daughter May had behaved atrociously.Same this week. She held a long meeting with Cabinet ministers to agreeon one course of action.Off sauntered Mrs May to make a speech proposing a markedly dferent course of action — a concession on a second EU referendum.You can’t blame Andrea Leadsom for quitting in fury.  When a PM goes rogue like that, anger is legitimate. Actually, it becomes necessary.Theresa May, a former bank worker and local councillor, entered the Commons in .Her Maidenhead seat had such a hefty “True Blue” majority that she felt she never needed to fear the voters.From the outset it was obvious that this slender, slightly bloodless backbencher would prosper. Not that she made brilliant speeches. Good heavens no. But she had that sheen of apparent competence that today’s managers have made their own.Youthful Theresa spoke the bland bureaucratic lingo and she did so with safely modulated rhythms. She never led, never resisted. She had Establishment printed all over her.She did politics the way the Tunnock’s factory makes tea-cakes. Everything was tidily wrapped. The outer coating was tempting. It was only when you bit into it that you realised how insubstantial she was.As Tory chairman in  she made a conference speech telling activists they were regarded as “the nasty party”.This created a sensation, London commentators saying she was right to shake shires Tories out of their delusions.But the volunteers, driven more by a sense of honour than clever-clever strategy, felt insulted. May had scored an own goal and weakened her political base. It was a mistake she would repeat as PM.She never suspected that speech would cause such a stink. Instead of revelling in her new-found prominence, she retreated to obscurity.Some politicians are always on the hunt for headlines. Not May. Anti-populism was more her thing. She became known as “Submarine May”, seldom surfacing, seldom making radio contact with high command, just prowling the deep.In the long years of Tory opposition she was shadow secretary of state for education, transport, local government, environment, culture and pensions and shadow leader of the Commons. “Shadow” was indeed the word.She was at best a penumbral figure. In none of these briefs did she do anything radical.Tory leaders kept her because she did not make gaffes, was sleaze-free her marriage to stockbroker Philip, one year her junior, was enviably strong and because every front bench needs a few bores.The occasional dullard makes the bright ones feel better about themselves.Her low-key approach was fine as a mere frontbencher, even as Home Secretary.She waded dutully through her red boxes. Once or twice she showed a sliver of political ankle. With the encouragement of Fleet Street, she blocked the extradition to the US of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.It surprised her boss, David Cameron, as much as anyone.May had kept the matter tightly to herself, chewing on it alone. She took on the Police Federation, whose leaders at that time probably deserved squashing a bit.Her longevity at the Home Office started to become part of her appeal. May was a stayer in a tricky job. So said everyone. Maybe she started to believe she was indestructible.Was she clever  Not startlingly so. But she was dogged.She was never caught out by a question of detail. In the ‘chillaxed’ Cameron government, that made her unusual.Not an easy colleague, though. She feuded with George Osborne and Michael Gove. A more silken operator would have smoothed down such squabbles.Come the EU referendum of , the submarine went into a deep e.May had been thought to be a closet Eurosceptic and the Camerons were relieved when she came out in support of Remain. That was about the last they saw of her.Mind you, given her uselessness at campaigning — which became so painfully apparent in  — they were lucky.If she had fronted any Remain rallies, the Leave vote might have gone even higher.Some accused her of cowardice in hiding from the fray but it meant that when Cameron quit, and leadership contenders contrived to blow their chances, May was acceptable as Brexit Britain’s new PM.“Brexit means Brexit and we’re going to make a success of it,” she claimed.  Her time at No  has, at times, been hard to watch.Worst moment was probably that  conference speech when her voice failed. What a farce that was.Her descent has been dizzyingly fast. In February , the Tories won the Copeland by-election. That was the high-water mark.Days later she went walking in Snowdonia and called a snap election. She went into the campaign  points ahead in the polls. And she blew it.Was it cockiness  Her lack of elan  Her turgid “strong and stable” slogan Okay, we Brits like an underdog but the Tories and Labour had promised to honour the Leave result and we naively believed them. Whatever the reason, May lost.From that moment her power shrivelled. She did have some merits. Her physical stamina, particularly for a diabetic, has been remarkable. Downing Street under her was much freer of shysters and crooks than it was in the Blair and Cameron years.She did not send loads of cronies to the Lords. She was polite, unlike phone-chucker Brown. She was uninterested in the shallow, celebrity world and continued to attend church most Sundays, even when political hassles were at their worst.There was seriousness about her, certainly. Yet that lack of vanity and modern vibes, on one level so honourable, became a handicap. Politics is salesmanship. If you can create an aura of excitement, it helps you to sell policies.May just bored the smalls off us. And she surrounded herself with inadequates. Some of her ministers were rank D-listers. The civil servants seized power and the electorate’s will went ignored.Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill may have thought he was helping her but in his sly attempt to bypass Brexit he has killed his mistress.For a woman so often hailed as stubborn, she proved a terrible pushover in the dealings with Brussels.And the “Bloody dficult woman”, as Ken Clarke called her, was equally feeble in standing up to Remainer ministers like Philip Hammond and Greg Clark.Was she incompetent  Or did shewant the softest of EU exits all along  Certainly looks that way.She might have got away with it had Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party not leapt out of nowhere. That has put that fear of bejaysus up Tory and Labour MPs.Mrs May might never had felt much need to heed the electorate but MPs in marginal seats are more alert to public sentiment.And public sentiment is now molten against May. Her premiership was only about Brexit. No other policy had a look-in.Her inability to deliver that central mission makes the verdict brutal but unavoidable: This stonewall warrior, secretive, robotic, dithery in an age that demands wit and clarity, was, as a PM, the most monumental dud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her loss of the Tory majority robbed her of her authority, boxed her in on Brexit and discredited her domestic policy agenda.The failure of that campaign carries an important lesson for the Tories — they need a happy warrior.May looked deeply uncomfortable on the campaign trail, with the result that the more the public saw of her, the less they liked.This Tory need for a good campaigner is heightened by the fact that their next leader will have to fight on two fronts, against both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage.On Brexit, May’s biggest problem was not knowing what she wanted. She triggered Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU that we had to request a humiliating delay to, without a clear idea of the kind of relationship she wanted — and how to get it.This meant that the UK wasted valuable negotiating time and ceded the initiative to the EU in the talks.The Tories need a leader with a plan. Whoever succeeds May will have to know what they want to get out of the EU and how they plan to get it. Given Brussels’ intransigence in these talks, they are also going to need Plans B, C and D.One of May’s other failings was that she didn’t understand one of the key purposes of preparations for No Deal.It wasn’t because you actually wanted — or thought you would end up with — No Deal. It was meant to secure a better deal.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis.If the UK had been more visibly prepared to walk away, then the EU would have been more constructive in the negotiations.The new Prime Minister must spend the summer examining the state of our no-deal preparations.Absurdly, the Brexit delay has not been used as a chance to improve the UK’s no-deal planning but rather as an excuse to soft pedal. That must change.May’s other great failure has been failing to build a team or create a sense of collective endeavour.Both the disastrous  manesto and her Brexit plan were executed with far too little Cabinet involvement.She sent civil servants to do the very political job of negotiating. The result was a deal that was, unsurprisingly, politically tone deaf.May’s successor must appoint a Cabinet of all the Tory talents — and let them do their jobs.And we need a Brexit Secretary who actually negotiates with Brussels.The Tories have no perfect candidate for No . No one fully fulfils all of these requirements.But a Prime Minister who could deliver Brexit would give the Tories a fighting chance.THE way to think about the Tory leadership contest is that it is like a tournament with two sides of the draw, with each side sending one candidate into the final membership round.One side of the draw is for full-on Brexiteers.Here Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Steve Baker and Esther McVey will duke it out.The other side of the draw features the Cabinet candidates: Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Whoever comes out of the Brexit side of the draw will go into the final round as the strong favourite, given how Tory members just want the UK to get out of the EU.I understand that Boris Johnson has edged ahead of Dominic Raab on this side of the contest.But he will, in the words of one key MP, need to be “materially ahead” of Raab on the first round.Why  Because Raab is more likely to pick up support as more hardline Brexiteer candidates such asRaab’s pitch will be that the Conservative Party is toastit cannot deliver Brexit – and that he is the man to do that.He will argue that other candidates might be better known than him, but Boris’s celebrity won’t save the Toriesthey cannot get Brexit done.But one of Boris’s advantages over Raab is that he has more reach into the rest of the party.His campaign is beginning to pick up support from former Remainer ministers, who see the former London Mayor as the Tories’ best chance of seeing off the twin threats of Corbyn and Farage.At the same time, some on the left of the party have decided that stopping Raab – who they see as a down-the-line right-winger – is now their priority, rather than blocking Boris.ON the Cabinet side of the contest, the question is whether Michael Gove can overhaul Jeremy Hunt.The Foreign Secretary currently has more MPs backing him than anyone  in the Cabinet.But his campaign has had a bumpy few weeks, and some of his supporters are beginning to peel away.This, perhaps, explains why Hunt felt the need to confirm that he was standing just hours after Theresa May announced her resignation yesterday.Part of Hunt’s problem with MPs is that it is very hard to see him beating Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab when it comes to the party members.Their experience with Theresa May has made the membership very wary of former Remainers.GEORGE Osborne has finally had his revenge on Theresa May.He sent a text to a slew of Cabinet leadership hopefuls saying that a big prize awaited the minister who went and told May that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill had to be pulled.Several recipients of this text were amused when Sajid Javid, who was one of Osborne’s junior ministers at the Treasury, then went to demand that May shelve the second referendum part of the bill.SOME members of the  parliamentary intake are considering running for the leadership.They should hold their horses – the new leader will need more than four years of parliamentary experience.But whoever becomes the new PM needs to freshen up the Cabinet, to bring in this new talent.After nine years in government, there are too many administrators in Cabinet and not enough doers.It needs an injection of energy and fresh ideas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will be ungenerous not to remember too her unshakeable dedication to her country and remarkable perseverance against what became insurmountable odds.She is a good person.

She appointed a Cabinet of loyal friends largely devoid of talent.She credulously swallowed bad advice from a staunchly europhile and dysal civil service.She lacked vital traits for a leader: core beliefs, confidence, decisiveness, mental agility, communication skills and a willingness to trust and delegate.These failings, and a suicidal manesto, were exposed at the  election. Stripped of her majority, she foolishly tried to pretend “nothing has changed” and made promises she couldn’t keep.She negotiated a Brexit deal which was bad enough even before Monday’s final, fatal compromises.Mrs May described what she sees as her legacy. It is thin gruel. The economy is doing fine, the job market booming. But she did next to nothing for Sun readers, for the “just about managings”.Brexit is undone, like her “social justice” agenda.

She leaves her successor an even more colossal task than her own.Whoever that is must, above all, stop Corbyn’s thuggish extremists winning power.That can only be done by delivering Brexit — yes, with No Dealneed be — and somehow seeing off the Brexit Party whose surge could let Corbyn in.Winning the battle of ideas against the Marxist Left will be far simpler.

Andyou are paid less than someone  because they are better than you then that is OK. But that is apparently not the case here.“Despite being awarded the same job, on the same day, after the same board, during the same recruitment process, BBC News asked me to accept a considerably lower salary than my male counterpart. A lot less,” Karen told colleagues by email.“I’ve been assured our roles and responsibilities are the same. I’ve also been told my appointment was ‘very well deserved’. It’s just that I’m worth £, less.“Over the past four months I have asked BBC News to think again. And they’ve inched their offer up . . . now the gap is nearer to £,. But for me it has never been about the actual salary. It has been about equal pay.”She also said she had turned down the job on principle after discussing the matter with her young daughters, which led her to conclude that she must “stand up for what is right”.And, to my mind, that is the real nub of this story.Her two daughters, aged seven and , said this to her: “You always tell us to stand up for what is right. If it means less pocket money or not going on holiday, we don’t mind.What matters to us is that when we grow up, we want to be paid the same as a man for the same job.”How poignant — and how powerful. Sometimes you have to see things through the eyes of children to realise there is only one course of action.It makes me think of that phrase: Strong women — may we know them, may we be them, and may we raise them.Well, Karen is certainly raising them. And her brave decision means that her children won’t be as subservient as the women of our generation.To an extent, women have always just accepted the status quo when it comes to men being paid more. But that’s changingStill, what Karen did by refusing the job and sending that email is brave. Most people don’t like to rock the boat, which sometimes means we accept things that should be unacceptable.And women, especially mothers, are often so grateful to have a job that they don’t question it. That’s especially the case for single working mums, as Karen is.Most single working mums simply can’t afford not to work, so they put up and shut up. But that expectation that women should accept less than they are worth makes my blood boil.Can you imagine, by the way,it had emerged that men were routinely being paid less than women  Would we ever hear the end of it Not until equality came. So maybe we all need to think like men for a bit.By rocking the boat, Karen is taking one for the team. She will be no doubt be seen as a troublemaker by some potential employers. But it’s not until people make stands like this that change happens.Despite the furore, the gender pay gap is still everywhere, and it’s not until people say, “No more” that things will change. The bottom line is that women need to start feeling a bit more entitled.We need to know our worth and not be afraid to ask for it. Because the sad truth is that people will pay you less than you are worththey can get away with it. So let’s not be muggins enough to accept it, eh HAVE you been following the story of chef Gary Usher, who was asked by a homeless man called Derickhe had any jobs in his restaurant He offered Derick a job as a kitchen porter. And then tweeted about it because he was happy to have done a good deed.His tweet then went viral. And then suddenly people started accusing him of exploiting homeless people to publicise his restaurant.But given the fact that Usher has declined every single one of the many invitations he has had to go on TV to talk about this story that is so patently untrue.And also, regardless of whether he publicised it or not, there is no doubt that he did a good thing.Still, he has been roundly vilied for what was evidently a kind-hearted gesture.Social media has made us into a nation of cynics and critics. The saying “no good deed goes unpunished” seems very true on this occasion.LOTS of teenagers will no doubt be envious to hear about Benjy Fish, the -year-old from Middlesex who has dropped out of school after being encouraged by his mother – to become a professional gamer.Benjy, who has so far earned £, playing Fortnite, is ranked among the best in the world.And he has guaranteed himself another £, by qualying for this year’s Fortnite World Cup, which boasts a prize pool of £million.He’ll be competing at the event in New York this July, which may sound like the dream for some, and I wish him all the best.But has any parent ever uttered the words: “I hope my son quits school at  to become a professional gamer”  I seriously doubt it.NO doubt the critics will line up to bemoan the fact that Davina McCall is dating again after her orce from Matthew Robertson.She is seeing her long-term friend and hairdresser, Michael Douglas, who she has known for more than  years.All I can think about is just how daunting it must be to put yourself “out there” and start dating again after  years of marriage and three kids.Add to that the burden of being famous, which makes it hard to join Tinder .But we should all wish Davina well – good for her for giving herself another chance at happiness and finding love again. She turned  in October and has got a whole new chapter of her le to live. Why should that be alone Divorcees out there should take heart. You are entitled to happiness. You might just want to go and have a bit of fun by putting yourself out there without waiting for Mr Perfect.Or the love of your le might already be under your nose, like Davina’s hairdresser.What could be better than getting together with an old friend, because he knows the real her. But also, possibly best of all, no more bad hair days.I HAVE no idea what is being shown at the Cannes Film Festival­ – these days it’s much more about the red-carpet dresses than the actual movies.And wow, were there some dresses this year.Alessandra Ambrosio, , and Sharon Stone, , dazzled in little red numbers.The most amazing thing is that there is  years between them. What is Sharon Stone’s secret  She never ages.SO sad reading about Jasmine Bush, the -year old schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train on the day she was due to receive the grades for her GCSEs in .She had been suffering with ious mental health issues, including anxiety, and had been on medication to help control the symptoms.But she had also been smoking marijuana to relieve anxiety symptoms. Except it clearly had the opposite effect. This story is every parent’s nightmare.Smoking weed is seen as innocent and has been normalised by the fact that “everyone does it”.

Since March , the day the UK should have left the EU, there has been a growing sense of political crisis.Brexit wasn’t happening and the government’s impressive achievements were being lost in the fog. If government was telling people about the growing economy, unemployment falling to its lowest since  or the UK attracting more inward investment in the last year than any other country in the world – no-one was listening.Theresa May was rightly committed to building a majority in parliament for something that would at least complete the first stage of Brexit and allow a new leader to negotiate the future relationship without constant battles in parliament getting in the way.But when she started offering concessions to Jeremy Corbyn’s far left outfitt, the mood in the Tory party darkened.As Chairman of the Parliamentary Conservative Party - the “ Committee” - I had to balance two very strong demands from my colleagues.Firstly, with the failure to exit the EU and the loss of so many brilliant councillors in local elections at the beginning of May, a majority of Conservative MPs had decided that a change of leader was essential.Secondly, most of my colleagues also took the view that Theresa should be allowed the space to leave the stage with dignity.However disappointed or angry people are that we are stuck in a logjam, they know that Mrs May has given it her all. Her dogged determination and absolute commitment to the service of our country have been obvious to everyone.It was sad and painful to be there at the moment that she said she would resign as leader of the party and no one could fail to be moved by her parting words outside No. The ConservativeParty knew that change was needed but I am glad that the process has begun with decency and respect.Some people inside and outside parliament have talked about me being a candidate for leader. As Chairman of the  Committee I would have been in charge of the election process so I stood down with immediate effect so that everything can be seen to be above board.I can now consider my position unconstrained. Whoever stands – and whoever wins, the task is a big one. It is nothing less than restoring the broken trust in British politics.We have to leave the EU as we promised we would and then get back to a radical agenda to let people take back control of their lives. Politicians need to talk less about social mobility and do more to make sure that everyone in our great country can make the most of their talents.The crucial starting point must be to reunite the Conservative Party: faced with the most extreme socialist threat that would destroy business, jobs and savings we owe it not to ourselves but to every decent hardworking citizen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Results will be revealed in a flood on the night of Sunday  May, from pm. Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party was expected to have scooped up a flood of protest votes in the poll on Thursday  May. Polls put the new outfit - which has no manesto or non-Brexit policies - on more than %. Thataposd be a final blow for Theresa May as she prepares to resign on June . So what should you look out for on results night and what does it all mean  Hereaposs a full geeksapos guide.    Follow the results LIVE Weaposre running a live blog on the night and a UK results in full service. Youaposll be able to follow the UK results as they come in from pm using the interactive tool below. Whoaposs voting and what for   The UK is electing  MEPs to sit in the European Parliament -  from Britain and three from Northern Ireland . Those MEPs will only sit in the Parliament until Brexit happens, currently scheduled for October  at the latest. All registered voters in the UK can vote. In this election you donapost vote for inidual candidates. Instead you vote for a party. You can see the key aims from the manestosfrom Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems. Meanwhile weaposve got a full list of candidates and a comparison of the key manestos on Brexit. And there are polls putting the Tories in as low as fth place.  Seats are split between  large regions of the UK. In each region, votes are counted for each party and then seats are allocated to those parties along a mathematical formula. Parties themselves decide which candidates get to scoop up their seats through a numbered list system. The formula iding seats up is called the aposDaposHondtapos system. In each region, the party with the most votes gets the first seat. Then that partyaposs total vote figure is ided by two - and the party with the most votes in the second roundgets the second seat. The process is repeated via a formula until all seats have been dished out. As it goes on,a party wins a second seat in its region, its vote total is then ided by three. If it wins a third seat, its vote total is then ided by four. And so on. If youaposre into this sort of thing thereaposs a full explainer _EN.pdf\" rel\"nofollow\"here. Where are the votes counted  Results are counted by hundreds of inidual councils, but not all those figures will actually be released. The only guaranteed published results will come at a single final declaration for each region. These declarations collate all the council-level results for each region into one final result, and proclaim who has got what seats. What time are the results in the UK  Apart from one small part of Scotland , all the results are expected between pm on Sunday  May and about .am on the Bank Holiday Monday. The delay in counting is due to EU rules that say no country should declare its results while another nation is still voting. This prevents, for example, a far-right surge in one country encouraging similar turnout in another country.  National estimates are expected to come in from the early evening on Sunday  May. The first projection for the European Parliament as a whole is expected shortly after pm UK time. Updated projections for the European Parliament are expected in the early hours of Monday  May. How can I follow the results  For our sins weaposll be covering it with a live blog and full breakdown of the results at mirror politics. Is there an exit poll  No The reason is these are very expensive for the BBC and Sky to run. We should have the results shortly after pm on Sunday anyway. Region by region guide NOTE: All declaration times are very rough estimates ONLY. Regional counts can only be declared once every council in the region has declared. That meansone council has a recount or a problem it will hold up the entire region. Our timeswere gleaned by talking to councils. The Press Association has also issued estimated times which weaposve stated too. East Midlands    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Unknown . PA: .pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  Lab  UKIP  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Annunziata Rees-Mogg - sister of Tory Brexiteer Jacob - is top of the list for the Brexit Party in this UKIP-dominated region. So be shockedthe ex-Tory doesnapost swoop in and take a seat. Conservative woes could well be exposed as the party defends a fragile % of the vote last time. Both incumbents, Emma McClarkin and Rupert Matthews, are standing again. Butthe polls are any guide, theyaposre not likely to keep their seats. And in , Labour were only one point behind the Tories on %. A reversal of their fortunes would hand a Tory seat to Labour.

NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  SDP  Brexit Party  UKIP  Lab  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: If a Tory wipeout is in the offing it will be on show here, where incumbent John Flack - second on the list - could even be vulnerable on a disastrous night. The newly-formed Brexit Party will hope to shore up its power base with the election of chairman Richard Tice and long-time Nigel Farage ally Michael Heaver, who founded the right-wing aposWestmonsterapos website.

COUNT DECLARED BY: Chelmsford City Council London    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Midnight. PA: am. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  Green  UKIP  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: UKIP leader Gerard Batten will be fighting to keep his seat as support flushes away amid his backing for far-right extremist Tommy Robinson. Former BBC presenter Gavin Esler could be one of the few victories for newly-formed Remain party Change UK. And the Brexit Party will be having a decent nightsmoked salmon tycoon Lance Forman - second on the regional list - wins a seat. The result will be important to Labouraposs factional battles too. Ultra-close Jeremy Corbyn ally Katy Clark is third on the list while Laura Parker of left-wing group Momentum, which has recently flexed its muscle and its own thoughts, is fourth. Votes were pretty well-spread in  so a lot could change. Labour had %, Tories had %, UKIP won %, Greens won % and Lib Dems won % at the last election. COUNT DECLARED BY: Lewisham Council North East    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: pm. PA: .pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Independent WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Recent elections have shown Labour votes ebbing away in the north of England in favour of pro-Brexit parties. So Labour officials will be watching closely to seethey can keep their hold on this stronghold, with incumbents Jude Kirton-Darling and Paul Brannen both standing again and ex-UKIPper Jonathan Arnott standing down. And it may be tougher than it looks. The supposed dominance of Labour hides the fact that the party only won % of the vote in the region in  - with UKIPaposs % snapping at its heels. A reversal of that isnapost impossible. The Tories were on % last time with Lib Dems and Greens barely scraping % each. COUNT DECLARED BY: Sunderland City Council North West    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Unknown . PA: .am. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Independent Con  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Far-right extremist Tommy Robinsonis standing as an independent. He needs huge inidual support to win - weaposre talking hundreds of thousands of votes. Sohe does win it will be a vast blow to anti-fascist campaigns in the UK. Elsewhere  A little like the West Midlands, the North West looks set to be a test of the three-way battle between Labouraposs carefully-nuanced Brexit position, the Toriesapos internal wranglings and the blunt instrument of UKIPand the Brexit Party . Labour incumbents Theresa Grfin, Julie Ward and Wajid Khan are all standing again. Itaposs not plain sailing for the Brexit Party - its number one candidate Claire Fox defended Republican violence just days after the IRA Warrington bombing in . But UKIP had % of the vote last time - not far behind Labouraposs % - and the Tories had %. Thereaposs a lot to play for. COUNT DECLARED BY: Manchester City Council Scotland    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: .am MondayNUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: SNP  Lab  Con  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: The last EU election was held before the extra SNP surge in the wake of the independence referendum the Labour collapse, and the Tory boost that followed. Expect a dramatic re-shaping of the ground once the Brexit Party is thrown in as well. Labouraposs Catherine Stihler is not standing again incumbent David Martin is joined by new candidate Jayne Baxter and Labour looks the most vulnerable here. Last time the party was in second place with % of the vote. Thataposs a very tough ask this time. Meanwhile Mark Meechan, a YouTuber who was fined £ after filming a pug giving a Nazi salute, would need less an earthquake and more a volcano to win as heaposs fourth on UKIPaposs list.

NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  Brexit Party  Lab  Lib Dem  Green  UKIP  Ind WHAT TO WATCH FOR: As the biggest region with the most MEPs, the South East is worth watching closely to seeanti-Brexit tactical voting is having any effect - and how the seats are split. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage would need the earth to cave in on itself not to keep his seat of two decades and his giant, accumulating EU pension. Tory Brexiteer Daniel Hannan is also guaranteed to stay unless there is a Conservative wipeout. Slightly more vulnerable are the parties that got fewer votes in . The Tories and UKIP got over % each in this region, while Labour had just %, the Greens had % and Lib Dems had %. COUNT DECLARED BY: Southampton City Council South West    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: pm. PA: pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  Lab  Green  Lib Dem  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: This seat has the biggest aposcharactersapos in the contest. Ex-Tory grandee Ann Widdecombe is almost certain to win a seat for the Brexit Party despite her antiquated views on LGBT rights and other issues. Rachel Johnson, sister of Tory Boris, will be vying to pick up a seat for pro-Remain outfit Change UK. If Labour pick up one extra MEP, arch-Remainer Andrew Adonis will win the seat. UKIP is putting up rape joke furore candidate Carl Benjamin, but heaposs second on the list so given UKIPaposs poll ratings heaposs unlikely to win. Ashley Fox, the Conservative leader in the European Parliament, should keep his seat unless thereaposs a Tory disaster. And lastly Green MEP Molly Scott Cato will be hoping to retain her seat given a recent Green boost in the polls. This is Brexiteer country - % of votes went to Tories or UKIP in  - but itaposs also an unpredictable area with a solid Green and Liberal base. A lot could happen. COUNT DECLARED BY: Christchurch and Poole Council Wales    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Midnight. PA: Midnight. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  Plaid Cymru  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Seats are split evenly here in a country that is a complex mix of traditional Labour votes, frustrated Brexiteers, Tories and the nationalist Plaid Cymru. Plaidaposs Jill Evans and the Brexit Partyaposs Nathan Gill are both incumbents standing again but Labour and the Tories have new candidates - Jackie Jones and Dan Boucher respectively. Labour won the most votes in , a solid ,, but the Tories only won , so look more vulnerable. That said, the Green and Lib Dem opposition in  was pretty meagre at less than % of the vote each. COUNT DECLARED BY: Pembrokeshire Council West Midlands    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Unknown . PA: Midnight. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  Brexit Party  UKIP  Independent WHAT TO WATCH FOR: By EU election standards, this was a pretty straight battle between the two main parties and UKIP in  with each winning two or three seats. Both Labour incumbents, Neena Gill and Sion Simon, and both Tory incumbents, Anthea McIntyre and Daniel Dalton, are standing again but the other candidates are new. This will be a test of whether the main parties can withstand the march of anti-Brexit parties like the Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK. Last time, the Lib Dems and Greens only just scraped % of the vote each. COUNT DECLARED BY: Birmingham City Council Yorkshire  The Humber      ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: .pm. PA: pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  UKIP  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Magid Magid, a former refugee who became Lord Mayor of Sheffield aged  and banned Donald Trump, will be hoping to pick up a seat for the Green Party. If Labour doesnapost lose any seats, it will install anti-Brexit campaigner Eloise Todd as an MEP - an interesting twist in Labouraposs internal contortions over whether to leave the EU.

Located in Hull, the grey doorway is now part of a recently opened souvenir and convenience store. Every day, hundreds of people walk past it, unaware of the notorious and tragic past that lies behind it.But the door once led to an infamous slum known as “Bartle’s Entry”, according to historian Mike Covell. Hull Live reports that within seven small houses lived seven families and  people.There was no running water – not even a communal tap – no toilets, inside or out, and no heating.The slum was also re with crime . It took its name from John Bartle, a miller and baker of ships’ biscuits, who operated from    Whitefriargateas early as . By the s, he was a success and opened a mill roughly where RB stands today at the corner with Mount Pleasant.Soon, though, tragedy struck. In , his son, John Junior, lost his we Jane just months after they were married. She was . Two years later, Bartle’s eldest son, James, died at just .

A few years later, records reveal the state of the notorious slum that sat next to the thriving business. Crammed into the shocking accommodation were the Reed family, the Moment family, the Robinson family, the Greenwood family, the Squires family and the Hill family. Conditions were said to have been truly appalling which is likely to have been the cause of deaths that followed. Among the many stories from the short history of Bartle’s Entry is the death of William King, who was found leless in his bed by his we in April . He went to bed without complaining of any illness and mystery still surrounds what killed him. Theft was another problem. The following year, police raided the slum and apprehended a William Johnson for stealing a large amount of clothes. As late as , an advertisement appeared in the Hull Daily Mail, offering houses in Bartle’s Entry to rent at three shillings per week. By then, the Bartle family had left and their bakery had been converted first into an umbrella warehouse and then into a branch of the Yorkshire Post newspaper. The slum houses, now recognised as unfit for human habitation, were closed and condemned at about the time of the First World War.

It has been uncovered next to the A in Newington, Kent. The site includes remains of a temple which has since been named Watling Temple - making it one of only  sites recorded in England. Archaeologists also uncovered an ancient seven-metre road which is believed to have been an alternative route to the A which runs from London to Kentish coast.    Experts have hailed the discovery as one of the most signicant finds in the region - but the newly revealed settlement is destined to become new homes as part of a Persimmon Homes new development.

However the football fan is said to have reined in his decorations this year - with his home sporting just a couple of banners. So he was stunned to have a letter pushed through his letterbox this week, asking him to remove the two flags.    The reason being that his neighbours believed that they resembled what would normally be seen on a council estate. The letter writer was also concerned that it could affect house prices, as they tried to keep the area sought after for housebuyers. Neil, who has lived on the estate for almost  years, said: I thought it was one of my friends on the wind-up, but Iaposve called everyone I know and they say itaposs not them. I couldnapost believe it when I read it, I thought it was a joke, thereaposs one other house with flags up on the estate, but I only have two up on my house.    No one said anything about the flags last year and I didnapost get any letters then, so I donapost knowitaposs someone whoaposd just moved into the area. Iaposve shown it to everyone and they canapost believe it, itaposs worded very strangely. Neil is driving to Madrid to watch the final on Saturday night with two others and is planning to keep the flags up while heaposs in the Spanish capital. Since receiving the letter Neil has put another flag up in a show of defiance. He added: The flags will be staying up. When we got the letter my lad was sad, because he thought we would have to take them down, but Iaposm not taking them down. The letter in full Dear Residents I am writing to you today on behalf of some of your fellow neighbours and surrounding residents. Some of us are very proud our local team has reached a final in Europe and we are all very passionate about it. Some of us are lucky enough to be going also, some not so. However we are proud members of Eccleston Park and itaposs beautul surroundings. We like to stand out and keep this suburb as sought after as possible. As a homeowner yourself surely you can understand that hanging flags outside windows is something of maybe a council estate or inner city style promotion. Some of our friends are selling their property and think this could have a financial factor on the price of their home. As a spokesperson for most of our neighbours I am a Red and I do hope we get our hands on that trophy, especially for our city. As a spokesperson I am also asking that you refrain from the bunting surrounding football. Many thanks for understanding and we wish you luck in your travel to Madrid Lets make our area the best.

More than , people have signed an online petition backing Dr Keith Wolverson who is facing a religious discrimination inquiry by the General Medical Council . The doctor, who has an unblemished record over a -year period, faces being struck off. The GP is being probed after he asked the woman to take off her niqab, saying he could not hear her describing her daughteraposs symptoms. The -year-old could be hauled in front of the disciplinary  and fears it could leave his career and reputation in tatters.    He revealed how he was offered free help from the GMC but angrily ripped up a leaflet sent to him in the post.He told the Daily Mail : The documents included an advice leaflet. It offered free counselling.“I tore it up and threw it in the bin. I would rather a rattlesnake babysit for my six-year-old daughter than be advised by the GMC.” He is currently making ends meet by giving hay-fever and joint-pain injections to patients, the Mail reported. According to the complaints received by GMC, the mother said she felt “victimised and racially discriminated” against during the consultation. She said Dr Wolverson had demanded her to remove the veil, even though she refused to take it off due to religious reasons. She claims the GP said he would not continue the consultation until she removed her niqab, saying he was rude and gave her a dirty look. Mohammed Shafiq, of the Ramadhan Foundation, said Dr Wolverson’s action was “offensive”, and said that a female member of staff could have been asked to help on that occasion.    He said that any stronger sanction would be unfortunate, and insisted Dr Wolverson be put on a ersity awareness course to deter future incidents from happening again. Joyce Robins, from Patient Concern, said losing a doctor over such an incident would be “criminal”. She told: “A doctor needs to be sensitive to a patient’s religion but safety must always come first. He first learned of the investigation earlier this month after the woman and her husband lodged a complaint. He said: I feel a major injustice has taken place. I absolutely no longer want to be a doctor. It is understood that he would leave his job at the Royal Stoke University Hospital and quit medicine regardless of the outcome of the tribunal.

For the night before his big day he was brutally GLASSED. The former policeman was attacked during a quiet pub quiz with some friends. He had  stitches in his nose to sew back a flap of skin that was hanging off. Some shards had gone in his eyes – leaving him blinded. Surgeons also plucked more pieces of glass out his forehead. Scott, , will never forget the words his new we Adele said after seeing his injuries for the first time at the altar. “She was crying,” he said. “But she told me she was glad I was here and that she was marrying me for who I am as a person – not for my looks. That brought another lump to my throat.”    Tears flowed as the couple embraced in front of guests, including their son Oscar, two. And although the wedding was a success, Scott admits it will be tarnished for ever. He said: “It’s meant to be the best day of your le but when I look back I’ll always remember I got glassed the night before. Scott was with friends at the Singleton Barn pub in Ashford, Kent, when drunken Tyler Plumridge, , a security guard, stumbled in at around pm. He had drunk two bottles of wine and cans of lager at home before heading to the pub to down another bottle. Slurring, he asked to join their table. For a quiet le, they agreed. But when Scott’s brother Mark, , went to the bar, Plumridge sneakily took his phone and wallet and tried to leave. Scott stopped him, asking him to empty his pockets. Instead, Plumridge stripped to his boxers and danced around the bar – before grabbing a pint glass and smashing it into Scott’s face.  He recalled: “All I could see was blood. I collapsed to the floor.” “As my friends tried to stem the blood, they said, ‘It’s not too bad.’ But I looked at my brother and could see in his face how bad it was. “He was in floods of tears and told me my nose was half hanging off and I had glass in my eye.” “I was crying. All I could think was, ‘I’m not getting married. I’ve ruined it all.’ “Adele and I had been saving for two years and I thought it was all ruined in a moment. I was a police officer in London for eight years and never got assaulted. But this happened to me in my local.” Scott, who became a ­carpenter after leaving the force, was rushed to AE where ­surgeons worked into the small hours to remove the glass and try to save his sight. “All I could hear was ‘plunk, plunk’ as they pulled out the shards from my forehead and my face,” said Scott, who has ­permanent nerve damage. “They filled up a tray with all the glass. “When I looked in the mirror I saw Freddy Krueger. “I was thinking it’s all over. I’d lost my eyesight, ruined my wedding. My career was gone.” He broke the news to Adele in an emotional phone call and askedshe wanted to call off the £, ceremony at Cooling Castle Barn, Rochester. But though devas­tated, Adele said it should go ahead. Pumped full of ­painkillers, Scott got out of hospital at am on the morning of his wedding.  His brother washed the caked-in blood from his hair. And the make-up artist hired for bride Adele was asked to help cover Scott’s scars. “Her mouth dropped when she saw me,” said Scott. “She promised to do the best she could but said that we’d still see it. She spent an hour working on me – probably more than she spent on Adele on her special day, which was bad.” The newlyweds spent the first weeks of their marriage shuttling between the William Harvey Hospital, Ashford, and eye specialists at Royal Victoria Hospital, Folkestone. Two weeks later Scott’s sight was restored and they headed to the Dominican Republic on honeymoon. Adele, , who works in ­marketing, said: “When I first saw him as I walked up the aisle my stomach lurched, I thought I might be sick. I just couldn’t bear to see how bad the damage was. Scott was forced to put a brave face on it for our wedding day but it was clear he wasn’t himself. “He definitely isn’t the same carefree person he was before the attack. He’s much more wary and anxious now and gets uncomfortable in busy, loud places.”  Scott was too upset to be in court when his ­attacker was sentenced this month. Plumridge, said to be “deeply remorseful” – got a -month suspended sentence at Canterbury crown court after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm. He was also ordered to do  hours of unpaid community work, to get help for alcohol abuse and pay Scott £, compensation. But the lenient sentence shocked Scott. “I didn’t want to see him or come face to face with him in court, it made me feel ­uneasy,” he admitted. “But what I do know is his sentence was a joke. The judge told him he would give him a second chance. “But Adele and I don’t get a second chance at doing our wedding or honeymoon again. “I still have nightmares about it now where I wake up in a cold sweat. The flashbacks are terrible. “My day of ­happiness is ruined but he gets to walk free.

Kaiden Jake Shattock, now sixth months old, was born with an undiagnosed condition that meant he was born with only  percent of his skin  - just enough to cover his face. Jessica Kibbler and Jake Shattock, who were  when they had their baby, said Kaiden was in so much pain that even the nurses couldnapost stop themselves from crying. Kaiden, whose hearing is also impaired, was born  weeks into the pregnancy and while Jessica had had some complications while carrying him, there had been no indication of his condition. The parents, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, both now , described Kaiden as red raw, like a piece of uncooked meat when they first saw him nine hours after he was delivered.  When the nurses took us into the room to introduce us to Kaiden for the first time, he was red raw, like a piece of uncooked meat, Jessica said. There we were, two -year-old new parents, with no experience of raising children, and our first was born very weak and very ill. Everyone was silent, and everyone was distressed and upset. Jake and I cried, but even the nurses left the room and cried their eyes out because they didnapost know what to say to use and didnapost know how  to help him.  Kaiden was so fragile he couldnapost be held for ten days and even than he had to be wrapped in a mattress before being picked up. Being born with skin on his face only, he couldnapost wear any clothes. He was miraculously able to grow some skin after six weeks, although it is so thin and fragile that itaposs easily prone to tearing and scabbing. The toddler has since battled necrotising enterocolitis, congential herpes, dermolysis, and bronchiolitis thanks to his lack of skin and premature birth. Although doctors warned the parents it was unlikely the baby would make it through, Jessica and Jake said they will do anything in their means to help their son.  Jessica suffered with hydronephrosis - a kidney complication - during her pregnancy, and almost lived at the University Hospital Coventry  Warwickshire. She suffered bleeding and a broken amniotic sac nearly three months before Kaidenaposs due date, and went into an early labour. There had been no sign, however, that her son would be born with something akin to a full body burn. The young mum said after spending six weeks in intensive care and being unable tohome until he was  weeks, Kaiden now weighs lb oz and is very happy. Heaposs so perceptive - heaposs really starting to take everything in, she said.  She said despite his ear impairment, heaposs got the loveliest smile and the prettiest laugh,you get him going. We managed to pull him through - and weaposre so happy. We donapost know how long this will affect him, orthis is lelong but weaposre there to look after him and to love him no matter. Now heaposs very happy, and so much better after all the treatment heaposs had. Doctors originally speculated his skin condition was caused by a sepsis-congential herpes combination, but have since ruled that out and tested for countless skin disorders.

Gardener Jon, , says he was more used to being spat at and kicked in the head by strangers as he bedded down each night near a seafront ice cream stand. But when teacher Katie Nicol sat down and asked how he had reached such a low ebb, her kindness blossomed into romance. Katie, , said: “I went to sit with him and said, ‘What’s your story ’ We just hit it off.” Before long the pair were swapping love notes – which Katie used to leave in Jon’s shoes. In , Jon wrote poems to Katie. And within three months they realised they had both found their sole-mate.    Katie said: “We clicked straight away, he seemed so genuine. Every day we laugh.” After their first meeting, kind-hearted Katie made daily visits to chat to dishevelled drter Jon on the beach at Cleethorpes, Lincs. She said: “I went and sat with him every day. He said he wanted to change his le so we decided we’d work towards that together.” Jon, who had previously been hooked on heroin and hallucinogenic Spice, had been homeless for  months. He said: “I got booted in the head a few times, and I was chased and spat at. “But a bloke that owns a couple of ice cream shops down there used to look after me.” Jon had almost started to give up on his future when Katie came along. But with her support, he is now off the streets, with a job and his own place to live.    And she has even helped set up a reunion with his long-lost dad Gary, who he had not seen since he was six. Jon added: “She’s helped me a lot, in so many dferent ways.” Katie’s first note was a simple one asking Jon what his favourite food was. But when they quickly transformed into love letters, Jon realised the relationship might develop into something more. He said: “She was sending me those notes and I thought, there’s something dferent here. I really liked coming back to them.” Jon’s poems to Katie – which she has kept – included verses about sleeping rough, and about the couple’s growing romance. In one, he wrote of his feelings: “I met Kate a few weeks ago – where it’ll end up I do not know. I started to give up on myself. This lovely woman stopped, and gave me some help.” Another swooned: “She’s amazing, prettier than any flower – beautul on the inside, as well as the out.”    Jon had started sleeping rough after spending more than two and a half years in prison. Katie explained how he had been convicted of GBH after assaulting a man who he caught in bed with his former girlfriend. Not put off by his past, Katie – a support teacher at a behaviour unit – invited Jon home for a shower, a haircut and a roast chicken two months after their first chat. A month later they were officially dating. And they have now been together for eight months. Divorced mum-of-two Katie added: “I wasn’t worried when he first came to my house – I felt like I could trust him straight away. “I asked him, ‘What’s your favourite food ’ and he said a roast dinner. “He hates sausage rolls because he got given them all the time. “He said to me, ‘I don’t want to ever eat chips again’. Our relationship has got a lot, lot stronger. We just laugh together all the time.”    Jon, who was begging with a cardboard sign that said, ‘Her lawyer was better than mine’, asked Katie out shortly after that first dinner. As the romance blossomed, Katie was even able to help him kick the drugs. But while her mum Annabel got behind their relationship, Katie said not all her friends had felt the same. She admitted: “We’ve had a mixture of reactions. The majority of my friends have been really supportive, however one has really had a major issue with it. “But people meet on Tinder all the time, which I think can be more dangerous than sitting and talking to someone for four months.” Katie, who is only recently orced, still gets on well with her ex-husband – and says he has also been supportive of her new relationship. As well as helping Jon off his drugs habit, she also helped to set up a reunion between him and his long-lost dad – who he met up with for the first time in  years. With the help of Jon’s probation officer and a warden from his former prison, they tracked Gary down. And soon they arranged for the father and son to meet in Katieaposs home town of Grimsby.    Jon explained: “My mum would move us around loads when we were kids. Katie helped me find my dad. “I was a bit overwhelmed when I first met him.” Jon and Gary are now making up for their lost time apart. And he has even spent a few months living with his dad at his home in Burton, Derbys. Jon and Katie now often go and stay with the family in the Midlands, and regularly meet up for barbecues. Still struggling to believe how Katie turned the tide of his le, Jon says he will be “forever grateful” to her for everything she has done. He said: “I used to think about this when I was sleeping on the beach, that I won’t be here forever… Thanks to Katie, that was true.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teacher who moved 300 miles","story":"NewsTeacher who moved  miles for job but was sacked after a week awarded £,An employment tribunal ruled there had been no evidence whatsoever that showed wrongdoing on the part of teacher Robert BurkeShareCommentsByJohn JeffayNeil Murphy:,  MAY NewsRobert Burke was sacked after just five days in the job \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teacher has been awarded over £, in damages after he moved  miles to take a new job -  but was sacked just five days after taking up the post.Robert Burke relocated from Oldham to work at a primary school in Aberdeen but was dismissed after his first week, the Manchester Evening News reported .An employment tribunal ruled there had been aposno evidence whatsoeverapos which showed any wrongdoing on Mr. Burkeaposs part.

After passing all the relevant checks, he took up the fixed-term maternity-cover post on October , , and was expected to continue until July , .  However, the tribunal heard that his contract was terminated after a week, following a phone call with his previous employer at Westminster International School in Pisa. The council’s HR adviser, Louise Fe, said it was aposnormal practiceapos to approach previous employers to find out what level of pay they had been on. The conversation prompted aposserious concernapos and the decision was taken to immediately dismiss Mr Burke. A contract was then sent out to Mr Burke three weeks later, which stated his fixed-term contract was only for a week - failing to mention he had been taken on as maternity cover. The council’s solicitor, Robin Taylor, told the tribunal the contract had probably been aposgenerated automaticallyapos and insisted it was not a direct attempt to falsy the document.  But in his ruling, the judge said the termination letter sent to Mr Burke also gave him aposconsiderable concernapos, and added: “It contradicts the reference to maternity leave. It was factually inaccurate in material respects.” Since the tribunal, Mr Burke has been battling bowel cancer. He says the stress had been aposunbelievableapos and that he was sure it had added to his ill-health. “I have never received any kind of apology from the council – they just get away with ruining people’s lives, he said. A spokesman from Aberdeenshire Council said: “We note the decision of the tribunal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast temperatures take","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Temperatures to take a plunge after bank holiday heatSunday could see a high of C in parts of the country but despite summer just being around the corner its downhill for the rest of the weekShareCommentsBySam Rkaina:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news offline video bank-holiday-weekend-how-weather-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTemperatures are set to drop next week once the last May bank holiday is over.

The latest casualty is the food chain belonging to celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, which has announced it’s closing all but three restaurants and making , people redundant. In his email to staff, Jamie wrote: “I’m absolutely devastated that we have had no choice but to put our much-loved UK restaurants into administration, which means the fate of Jamie’s Italian UK, Fteen London and Barbecoa is now in the hands of an administrator, who will be responsible for the operations of these restaurants and their future.” His reasons for the failure of his empire were nothing new. He blamed the struggles of the casual dining sector, soaring business rates and the decline of the high street. I think there are other more important contributing factors that have led customers to say arrivederci to Jamie’s Italian casual dining experience and that is Oliver’s lack of understanding that the new “going out” is “staying in.” Customers and the times they live in adapt and evolve – and companies need to do the same to survive. If you ask me, what killed Jamie’s business was his failure to compete with factors such as our love of box sets and an increasing desire to order restaurant food to eat in the comfort of our own homes.    I can’t remember the last time my hubby and I decided to eat out. There was a time when we’d go out at least twice a week with the kids because it was supposed to be a treat and I got a break from cooking. But I think the toll of sitting in a crowded, noisy restaurant that serves mediocre food at sky-high prices has, over time, changed our attitudes and habits. I believe the introduction of binge-watching box sets was definitely a turning point for us. Hubby and I have in recent years found much joy – after a long, hard working week – in snuggling up on the sofa and checking in with our favourite TV characters, whether it’s the Queen from The Crown or Jon Snow from Game of Thrones. I can’t tell you the excitement that starts on Friday afternoon, knowing that in the evening all I’m going to do is get my PJs on and sit in front of the screen. No childminding fees, no annoying loud people sitting at the table next to you and no effort required – bliss. And when it comes to what to eat we, like so many others, are turning to delivery services that bring your favourite restaurant food to your home. So why on earth would anyone want to go out to Jamie’s restaurants, sit on hard chairs and drink over-priced cheap plonk  Added to that, many people like us are knocking down walls to create a more open-plan, larger living space, where we can entertain our friends in comfort. If I were a budding entrepreneurial chef, I’d take note of these trends and offer fine dining in the comfort of people’s homes. Take it from this former Apprentice, Jamie, the high street might be dead, but our homes are alive and kicking. I’d welcome my own chef to come and cook for me... so I can dine in style while bingeing on a box set.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"one way to keep tarbert flowing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is about to get a new, improved sewer serving the village.Roads, however, will have to be dug up to replace existing underground pipes.

Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

It is obvious to everyone that the pier not being open is a resource wasted.#Inveraray Pier has been in existence since . Comprising an older stone-built section and later timber structure, it was once a thriving hub for Inveraray#s herring fleet and a popular destination for passenger steamers. It was used by everything from pleasure craft to puffers, with the military also making good use of it over the years.In more recent times it has fallen into disrepair and was closed off to public access in the last decade.#When we heard it was for sale we decided to make a bid,# continued Mr Byrne.#It would have been a shame to see it fall into the hands of someone who would want to use it just as a private pier. It#s about securing its future.#The Byrne family intends to re-open the pier for public use # but Mr Byrne is keen to dampen speculation about the potential future uses for the structure.Before anything  happens, the condition of the stone and wooden sections must be assessed, and reports have been commissioned from engineers and conservation architects.#I don#t want to raise expectation unnecessarily, but the most likely scenario is that we look to re-open the stone pier first of all,# explained Mr Byrne.Repairs would be needed to the stone structure and ironwork. New handrails and safety equipment would be needed along with lighting and basic security measures such as CCTV.Beyond that, the future of the wooden pier looks less certain.refurbishment is not an option, alternatives might include floating pontoons, while the potential for dredging around the pier and harbour might be considered.Through an agent, The Argyll Partnership, the Byrne family has contacted the Clyde Marine Planning Partnership with a view to having Inveraray included in the fledgling Clyde Regional Marine Plan, stressing that the pier #represents a great opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and environmental needs of the Clyde Marine Region#.And the new owners have said that the community council, Inspire Inveraray and others from the area will be fully involved as the redevelopment takes shape. The plans are also said to have the backing of the Duke of Argyll.Mr Byrne concluded: #Hopefully local people will want to help and come forward with ideas.#I don#t want to raise hopes at this early stage, but I hope that buying the pier is a good thing to do.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 24 5 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe numbers drawn for the Kilmory Camanachd Club lottery draw on Monday May  were ,  and .

It is not acceptable that vegan children are missing out on free school meals, or that they are excluded from eating in the school canteen with their friends.ldquoWe should be supporting children who have made a moral decision to avoid animal use and killing, recognising the impact their behaviour has on others.

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure agreements, surely council tax payers are entitled to a full and comprehensive explanation as to why the council them ldquoThe public, quite rightly, will be asking why do the council have to pay out this money, they may be asking is there something wrong with the management at the top ldquoThe public would love to know why pound, has to be spent to keep a former employee quiet when this admin are making cuts left right and centre, but yet they can find pound, to give to former employees.However, the councilrsquos leader of the opposition, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, urged a more even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by other Scottish local authorities. ,params: .pushldquoInformation is limited by some, for example Edinburgh and Aberdeen cities, refusing to respond to freedom of information requests for details. ldquoBut Glasgow City, who have responded to an FOI, and are a much larger local authority than the Scottish Borders, have applied non disclosure agreements more than six times as frequently as Scottish Borders Council over the last five years.ldquoI am minded, as chair of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee, to discuss with colleagues on this committee whether to suggest we should scrutinise the councilrsquos use of non disclosure agreements. ldquoThis would, of course have to be done in strict privacy, but it might allow some reassurance to the public that these

Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos.

This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge.

Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":null,"title":"top-scientist-backs-public-health-campaign-on-stupid-nitro-meat","story":"In an interview, Professor Denis Corpet said the link between nitrite-meat and bowel cancer is ldquoclear and said parents and consumers need to know what they are eating.His call came after the Herald on Sunday launched a campaign urging the Scottish Government to ensure that the meat offered in schools and hospitals is free of nitrites. Every opposition party at Holyrood backed the call, meaning that it has majority support in the Scottish Parliament.: Parent groups urge action on process meat in schoolsLabour MSP Monica Lennon said: ldquoProfessor Corpet is right to demand that more public information is made available in Scotland about the risks posed by nitro-meats. Scottish Labour fully backs a ban on processed meats containing nitrites in our school and hospitals. The Scottish Government can act now to protect and improve the health of the nation, and they should act swtly.In , the cancer wing of the World Health Organisation published a report which placed processed meat, which includes bacon, ham and deli products, in the same carcinogenic category as tobacco and asbestos.Experts concluded that a daily intake of g of processed meat - the equivalent of two rashers of bacon, or one hot dog - increases the risk of colorectal cancer by %.The health risk occurs when processed meat which includes nitrites - a preservative - is heated, producing carcinogenic nitrosamines in the body.Previous estimates have suggested that % of bowel cancers and % of all cancers in the UK are caused by eating red or processed meats.Bowel cancer is the third most common type of the disease in Scotland. Every year around , people are diagnosed and around , people die.Herald on Sunday campaign: time to dump nitro meat from schools and hospitalsHowever, although the WHO report was published four years ago, scientists and politicians have been frustrated at what they regard as a lack of action from governments across the world.In February, it was revealed that around three quarters of councils in Scotland are offering nitro-ham to pupils, and nearly twenty local authorities confirmed that they provide other nitrite-meat, including bacon, corned beef and chipolata links.Nitro-meat is also served in hospitals and, on this basis, we launched a campaign to stop these products from being given to pupils and patients.Professor Corpet was one of the scientists behind the WHO report and is based at the French National Veterinary School in Toulouse. He said of the research he carried out: ldquoWe were able to demonstrate that the rats that were given sausage, or sausage roll, or bacon, are at higher risk for colorectal cancer, than the rats that were given the same meats without nitrites.ldquoIt can be prevented by removing nitrites.On governmental inaction since the reportrsquos publication, he said: ldquoThe consumption of processed meat is carcinogenic. That was the true statement. It should be enough to act or to change things.ldquoThey [Governments] did nothing. They were just waiting. I donrsquot know why. Four years later, nothing was issued, in France, or Europe or in the UK. This was very strange.Labour council leader: I want our school meals to be nitrite-freeProfessor Corpet said industry mounted a lobbying effort to claim they were not ready to make changes, but he insisted: ldquoThe Government should say lsquotry to make something which is not carcinogenicrsquo. The Government should say we want safe meat. Some [companies] will just remove nitrites, others will add vitamin e.On removing nitrite-meat from Scottish schools, he said it would be hard to implement a ban when parents feed their children ham at home. However, he backed a public health campaign on processed meat and nitrites: ldquoThey should be told that they should not normally eat it. As soon as the consumers are aware, they will choose [something healthier].He said nitrite-meat could either be phased out over a number of years, or reduced to a level such as once a week: \"It is really stupid to have processed meat [presented] as normal meat.Professor Corpet also said there is a poverty aspect to the debate: ldquoIt is worse for poor people who eat a lot of low price hot dogs, which are full of nitrites while rich people are eating salmon, he said. ldquoPoor people will move more slowly than rich people.However, his main target of criticism is the national food quangos whose job it is to protect the public: ldquoI understand why Governments were not worried, as they have other things to do. But it is the agencies - it is their job.The Scottish Government last year launched a consultation on overhauling the food and drink regulations for schools. One of the proposals is for the introduction of a maximum level for red and processed meat.At First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday, Labour MSP Monica Lennon asked Nicola Sturgeon whether she agreed that nitro-meats should no longer be served in Scotlandrsquos schools and hospitals.The First Minister replied: ldquoThere are, of course, international standards, with which we will fully comply. We are absolutely committed to supporting the health and wellbeing of children in schools and have a key role to play in the provision of balanced, nutritious food and drink every day, which our regulations help to ensure.Guillaume Coudray: removing nitro-meat from schools and hospitals is \"urgent\"A Scottish Government spokesperson said:ldquoProviding healthy meals for children and patients is vitally important. We regularly consider what public health campaigns are necessary and will study with interest the comments from Professor Corpet.ldquoWe expect schools and hospitals to serve healthy and nutritious food. We are currently considering responses to our recent consultation on nutritional school food standards that proposed introducing a maximum level for red and red processed meat, which will help to inform future changes to legislation."},{"url":null,"title":"tories-and-labour-braced-for-europe-poll-backlash","story":"Opinion polls have suggested Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party could be on course for victory in the European contests, with results due to start coming in on Sunday night.The Liberal Democrats, from the opposite side of the Brexit ide, are also expected to pick up votes.The European elections took place almost three years after the UK voted to leave the EU because of Theresa Mayrsquos failure to get her Brexit deal through Parliament, and could deliver a damaging blow for the Tories after a distinctly lacklustre campaign.Prominent Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said he feared the party was facing ldquototal wipeout and would be left without any representation at all.The Brexiteer, who has been a member for South East England since , said he suspected the party would be left with ldquozero MEPs following the poll.Seventy-three MEPs will be elected to represent the UK, with England, Scotland and Wales using a form of proportional representation called the DrsquoHondt system and Northern Ireland using the single transferable vote method.Thank you to everyone who voted for the @Conservatives today.

That much has now been acknowledged by politicians. But, rather than acting urgently, it feels asthey hesitate. They dither. Some of this, perhaps, is denial, some distraction by Brexit, some fear of what it means to tackle key industries. But also, there is the issue that, for the government to move and act, it needs to feel that it can take the people with it. Do the voters want it Talking with researchers in the field over recent months, Irsquove come across a frequent refrain of sympathy for the government. They feel for politicians because green policies are not always popular, and, in spite of the impact of Extinction Rebellion and school climate strikes, there is doubt over the publics mood. The Brexit movement, for instance, has a strong anti-regulatory tone. In some quarters even the softest of government control is described as nannying.Janette Webb, a professor in social science at the University of Edinburgh, notes that politicians still tend to see green regulations as a poison chalice. ldquoThey are wary about introducing new taxes and regulations because they fear they would lose votes. But social science shows that introducing some new regulation is generally a very good way to change behaviour.One of the key questions, she says, is, ldquoDo they regulate people like me and you  Or do they regulate the source, the supply People tend to fear change. As food activist Evie Murray acknowledges, ldquoThere are a lot of people who donrsquot want change, who still want to be able to take their car, maybe dropping off three kids on the way at dferent places and then get into work by am. They feel that now, as well as manage my mortgage and manage my family, Irsquove got to ditch my car. Though actually what were talking about is a car-free environment with less rushing, less stress.And tackling the climate crisis is about taking on a lot of change at once. In This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein writes: ldquoFor us high consumers it involves changing how we live, how our economies , even the stories we tell about our place on earth Whatever the route ndash a raft of new government policies or some kind of wider economic and social revolution ndash change is required.But itrsquos not just the practical change some are not ready for ndash itrsquos the kind of rules, regulations, incentives, bans and taxes it may take to make it happen. Are we prepared for what may feel like a Big Green Nanny state  Are we ready for a possible level of government intervention that is out of keeping with the liberal philosophy that has dominated for decades Are we, indeed, even up for for some of the smaller shts we may need to make The response so far has suggested the British public has some way to go. According to the Kicking The UKrsquos Car Habit report, published last month, % of people said ldquonothing would convince them to switch from their private car to less polluting modes of transport. ldquoConcern for the environment was the least popular of the list of things that would convince them.However, the mood is continually shting, and even the most avid car enthusiasts recognise change as necessary. John Shiveral from online motoring-enthusiast site Tartan Tarmac observes, ldquoI donrsquot know any car enthusiast who is getting upset about the prospect of getting from A to B in an electric car. Some electric cars are extremely exciting. Therersquos a general acceptance that something needs to change.More controversial is the idea of ditching our car-dependency all together. As Jan Webb observes, ldquoWe have a really effective motor industry and a government committed to keeping those jobs in place. Irsquom glad Irsquom not a politician because how do you handle that huge question of the jobs  The Scottish Government is doing well in tackling that head-on by creating the Just Transition Commission.When it comes to changes in our home heating and insulation there is also a limited appetite for change. Dr Niall Kerr, of the University of Edinburgh has researched home energy policies and notes, ldquoOne of the issues is how households would react to well-established technologies like fossil fuel heating systems and vehicles, being prohibited. People are used to these technologies and the low carbon alternatives currently provide a similar service but for more money. These low carbon technologies will also require signicant investments in infrastructure. A critical issue is how this is paid for ndashit is to be socialised then, to what extent, and how Even what seem like relatively small, conservative policies have their opponents. How do we imagine the phasing out of new petrol cars by , proposed by Scottish government, is going to work when there are people currently resistant to smaller measures like the workplace car levy, congestion charging, or banning diesel cars from the city.Tony Craig an environmental psychologist at the James Hutton Institute says a strength of feeling is gathering. Too often, however, he observes, ldquoPeople can end up powerless to do anything in the face of such an enormous problem. Itrsquos very important that the discussion around environmental behaviour tries to avoid a kind of collective action paralysis.Rose Hamilton, an Edinburgh-based communications manager who drives a diesel car, reflects some of the wider doubts. She observes that electric cars are now being ldquomarketed as the new solution. ldquoThe message is, lsquoEverybody stop using petrolrsquo, she says, ldquoBut it seems there isnrsquot a long-term plan for that either.She recalls that when, eight years ago, she bought her diesel car, it was regarded as relatively environmentally friendly. ldquoI thought I was doing a good thing ndash but now these are the cars theyrsquore trying to get off the road because of their emissions. So, Irsquom wondering what am I being sold next  Andthatrsquos a lithium battery, then what happens when every single person has a lithium battery and the lithium mining has destroyed entire parts of our country  Isnrsquot it better just to keep an old car on the road Yet the broad direction of the sht necessary, on many levels, is clear. One of the answers is that many of us need to consume less and travel less. Hamilton herself, espouses this, ldquoThe only long-term solution is letrsquos just stop moving around as much. People need to live closer to where they work and be content with holidaying overseas far less often. How we source our food will have to change. I just donrsquot see an awful lot of government campaigning around that kind of effort or talk about how theyrsquore going to change our infrastructure to enable us to do that.Infrastructure changes, she believes, are vital ndash whether thatrsquos good recycling bins or easily walkable routes to school. Environmental psychologist Tony Craig agrees. He notes that most people have now shted to happily recycling glass bottles. ldquoThis change in behaviour has come about mostly because the infrastructure was provided that made that easy.Meanwhile, there is clear need for planning and regulation that takes into account the wide range of environments people in Scotland live in. John Shiveral says, ldquoAs someone who lives in the middle of nowhere, in Argyll, Irsquom concerned that legislation and regulation will be whipped up in the bubble of a crowded capital city and enforced without a thought for people who donrsquot live in a city and are absolutely dependent on, currently, internal combustion vehicles. One bus passes my home a day.Its important, too, that solutions arenrsquot just about shting environmental impacts from one place to another. Tina Woolnough led a successful campaign to reject the Edinburgh City Council congestion charge in . Her concern then was that ldquothe scheme was going to funnel traffic through all the residential areas and past all the schools. A congestion charge is once again being mooted and she says, ldquoYou canrsquot be for or against, you just have to look at whatrsquos being proposed.One view shared by many I spoke to is that government is still taking enough leadership in terms of raising awareness. Part of the message it fails to get across, as both Hamilton and Murray point out, is that many of the changes have wider positives in terms or wellbeing. The zero-carbon society isnrsquot about loss ndash the real loss beingwe donrsquot do it. ldquoA third of all emissions come from peoplersquos cars, says Murray. ldquoTheres childhood obesity. These would be reduced. The changes are actually going to have spin off benefits. The big change she is trying to help drive home is in food system and, as a member of the Scottish Food Coalitions shes been part of a submission to the Good Food Nation bill to change this.The chances of government getting it wrong, of appearing unjust and prompting backlash, are there ndash particularly when the wider economic system continues to create increasing wealth inequality. Last years Gilets Jaunes protests against the French fuel tax form a warning. Its worth bearing in mind, though, wasnrsquot so much that the tax itself was unfair, but the wider political and economic system it was delivered, one of widening inequality, in which an elite continues with the kind of high carbon lestyles unimaginable to most, was.Whatever the short-term popularity risks, politicians canrsquot afford not to tackle this ndash now and urgently. ldquoWe have to bite the bullet, says Janette Webb. ldquoWersquore doing it for our children as much as anything."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9903132.jpg?type=article-full","title":"former-scotland-rugby-star-slammed-over-junkie-labour-poster","story":"Norrie Rowan, who was capped  times for his country, is under fire for targeting a Labour councillor who chairs the board behind the planned service.Rowanrsquos poster, which he says he has distributed in local shops, reads: ldquoIf you want a junkie for a neighbour vote Labour.:Find some backbone on Brexit ndash fast: Watson attacks Labourrsquos second ref stanceEwan Aitken, the chief executive of Cyrenians, a charity that helps tackle homelessness, said: ldquoThese posters are an outrageous abuse of fellow citizens.

The house, designed by John and Robert Adam, is full of furniture designed by Thomas Chippendale, but the grounds are just as glorious.There are plenty of places to start your walk but one of the best is the small car park off the Barony Road near the A at Auchinleck. This is the northernmost point of the Duchess of Rothesay Avenue, a long, straight path lined with lime trees and a quarter of a million daffodils. Go mid-morning and,yoursquore lucky, you will walk all the way in the sun. You can also stop half way at the Temple Gate, a -year-old gatehouse restored as part of the ongoing work on the estate.At the bottom of the avenue, wander round the arboretum and check out the Japanese-style bridge over the River Lugar. The bridge is only a few years old but its design was taken from an original drawing submitted by the Scottish architect Robert Weir Schultz in the th century.Next follow the River Lugar through the woods towards Cumnock. The town is the capital of Ayrshires industrial history and youll see plenty of evidence of it on the walk, including the hoist of the former Barony mine on the horizon, like a giant letter A. Wander along the river before turning north and heading back up to the car park.Pit Stop: The Coach House Cafe on the Dumfries House estate is a great place to stop. Itrsquos open seven days a week and serves that most modern of delicacies: the vegan sausage roll.MARK SMITHThe Commando Memorial and High Bridge, Spean Bridge, LochaberTime: Around - minutes, or longer to fully appreciate the scenery.What makes it special: It might be just shy of three miles but this little walk has everything: breathtaking views of Ben Nevis, oodles of history, a good mixture of flat paths and short inclines and accessibilityIt is easily located, by foot a mile from the village of Spean Bridge, or start half-way up the hill, through a gate off the A. Go through a kissing gate at the foot of the Commando Memorial, the A-listed monument built in  to soldiers who trained here during the Second World War.The walk is steeped in childhood memories and family landmarks, weaving through wooded and open paths along the River Spean, close to my old primary school, Kilmonivaig, and the pebbled shore of the River Spean, where my sister and I were taken for picnics with banana sandwiches in the holidays.The old croft house where my mother grew up, Achnahannet, is visible in the distance, at the start of the route. The first half of the walk is almost entirely downhill, through woodland, grass and heath and a joy to run.The path eventually joins the old railway line, and arrives at the ruins of High Bridge, crossing the steep gorge of Glen Spean.There is an information board about the bridge and its role in the  Jacobite rising. It was the site where the first shots were fired against British troops by Jacobites loyal to Prince Charles Edward Stuart. Three days after the clansmens victory, the Prince raised the standard at Glenfinnan, marking the start of the doomed campaign.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneThe path eventually veers away from the river and crosses heathland, ascending gradually and then sharply. There is a welcome seat, ahead of the steepest incline to take in lovely views of Aonach Mor and Ben Nevis.The path is well made and suitable for some all-terrain baby buggies. However, the wooden bridges can be slippery and dogs must be kept on leads.Pit stop: The route ends by the side of the A, around half a mile from the village, where walkers can enjoy a restorative cup of tea and decent scones at Spean Bridge Woollen Mill.CAROLINE WILSONStrathclyde Park, MotherwellTime: Its up to you really. There are so many options. A full circuit on the path alongside the loch is just over three milesWhat makes it special: The park has , acres of mature woodland, rough wetland and open water, providing a home for more than  dferent species of animals and birdsA level tarmac path runs round the loch. This is the one I tend to do, andI am feeling energetic I walk around twice. You will, however, spend your time avoiding the cyclists and dog walkers. I do this walk with my friend who is afraid of dogs, which is entertaining to say the least! From Strathclyde Park to Barons Haugh RSPB nature reserve short sections of the walkway have relatively steep gradients. A detour around the nature reserve will reveal meadow, marshland, scrub and woodland habitats. After leaving the reserve the walkway passes Dalzell Estate, originally a royal hunting forest. In the th century the estate lands were transformed into an orderly and landscaped park. From Dalzell Estate and beyond Adders Gill the path is prone to flooding, especially in winter, so an alternative route is signposted.Pit stop: The waterfront cafe is good for coffee and cake, or a soup and sandwich.JACKIE BROGANUrgha to Rhenigidale ndash The Postmanrsquos Path ndash HarrisTime: - hours.What makes it special: An ancient island route that features stunning coastal views, sheltered coves and abandoned villagesUntil its road was opened in , the tiny settlement of Rhenigidale could only be reached by boat, or via the Postmanrsquos Path, a spectacular and in places challenging, .-mile route across hill, bog and rock. It wasnrsquot only the postie that used the path, of course children walked the route once a week, in all weathers, to and from secondary school in Tarbert.Starting out in Urgha, two miles from Tarbert, the gentle start offers great views of Clisham, the highest peak on the Western Isles, giving way to a steeper descent. The detour to the deserted settlement of Molinginis ndash which once had  residents and its own school ndash is well worth the ersion.Further along the route, the zig-zag descent to the shore at Loch Trolamaraig can be tricky, but itrsquos the perfect place to enjoy a picnicthe weather allows. If yoursquore lucky, you might see seals or even an otter near the shoreline.Heading back upwards, past more abandoned cottages and round steep clfs, Todun, the m hill above Loch Seaforth, dominates the latter stages of the walk. Through a gate, you eventually reach the now famous road, built after a David and Goliath fight by local man Kenny Mackay, the former postman who walked the path three times a week and still lives in the village.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneStanding above Rhenigidale, on a clear day you can see to the Shiant islands and beyond. You can see why Mr Mackay and the other residents love the place so much.Pit stop: Facilities are limited ndash there is no hotel, shop or cafe ndash butyou need to rest your head, therersquos a cosy hostel run by the Gatlf Trust and a holiday hometo let.MARIANNE TAYLORNewport-on-Tay and Berryrsquos Den, FeTime: Half an hour to a whole day ... itrsquos up to youWhat makes it special: This lovely community, straight across the Tay from Dundee, is just ripe for a wander around ... and Berrys Den is an unexpected treatDundeersquos all the rage just now hellip and itrsquos all thanks to the VA. But what to do once yoursquove visited this amazing attraction  Whatyou want to get out of the city  Well, herersquos an idea hellipIf you look across the river from the museum, thatrsquos Newport, and yoursquoll notice a huge patch of woodland that seems to cut the village in half ndash thatrsquos Berryrsquos Den.I grew up just along the road from here, and this wonderful labyrinth of tracks, ornamental ponds, giant trees, hidden woodland paths and historic buildings was the ultimate urchinrsquos playground.Nowadays, it still holds the same charm, and you can get to it with a five-minute drive across the Tay Bridge. You can even walk there on a nice day ndash it takes less than an hour. There are a number of ways in: just out of the wee town centre on High Street, halfway up the hill on Cupar Road ... or my recommendation would be to keep walking up Cupar Road until youre almost at Newport Primary School. The entrance is then on your right through the grand gate, and from here you can wander through the whole estate to the bottom gate on High Street .And while yoursquore there, why not stroll around Newport itself .Pitstop: Newport has plenty of shops and places to eat, so you wonrsquot be stuck for sustenance.ANDY CLARKKirkintilloch to Torrance loopTime: Around  hoursWhat makes it special: The glorious backdrop of the CampsiesOK, so its not the most picturesque of starts, in Barleybank car park in Kirkintilloch ndash but it does get better, I promise.Cross Cowgate and head down the slope on to the Forth  Clyde Canal towpath heading towards Bishopbriggs.Meander along the canal ndash its all fairly flat so not too strenuous ndash and after about one mile you come to the Stables. Passing the restaurant ndash or indeed stopping, like me, for refreshment ndash continue along the towpath to Cadder church.From here, its a leisurely stroll to Cawder Golf Course and along the riverbank path towards Torrance .In Torrance, heading up the main streetbeyond The Rambler pub, turn right into a small play park. This park was the former site of Torrance railway station which used to welcome children from inner city Glasgow in the s and s to their first taste of the countryside.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneTake the path down to the left and come on to the route of the old Kelvin Valley Railway line.Follow the old railway line through open farmland, with further views of the Campsie fells. When you can follow the old line no further, head down the wide path to the right and go along the edge of Hayston Golf Course to reach a wooden gate and sign for Kirkintilloch. Continue along the path to reach the River Kelvin, head up the path between fields to reach Hayston Road. At the top of Hayston Road, cross the A Glasgow Road and turn right.Take the small path crossing the bridge and leading you up a short steep hill back onto the Forth  Clyde Canal and back into Kirkintilloch.Pitstop: Take your pick of the Stables, The Torrance Inn, The Wheatsheaf and The RamblerVICTORIA BRENANCorstorphine Hill to Inverleith in the footsteps of Robert Louis StevensonTime: frac hours What makes it special: The views, the iety of terrain and the fact that for large parts of it yoursquod never know you were in the cityEven without the RLS connection itrsquos a beautul walk, starting high with a glorious view over the capital from Corstorphine Hillthen dropping down into the lush riparian walkway that accompanies the Water of Leith as it runs from Roseburn to Stockbridge past the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and St Bernardrsquos Well. But for fans of RLS itrsquos a particular treat.At Rest and Be Thankful on Corstorphine Hill you can stand in the spot where Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour say their farewells at the end of Kidnapped. From there you can either head east along Ravelston Lane or descend the hillrsquos southern slope to the main road where at Western Corner you find Sandy Stoddartrsquos towering  sculpture of the pair. Then itrsquos on to picturesque Dean Village, fictional home of Catriona MacGregor Drummond, the titular heroine of Stevensonrsquos  sequel to Kidnapped. Finally you end up at super-posh Howard Place in Inverleith, where the author was born in .Pit stop: Do it on a Sunday and Stockbridge Farmersrsquo Market will be in full swing. The paella is excellent. Monday to Saturday, Edinburghrsquos answer to Notting Hill is packed with chi-chi cafes, pubs and eateries. There are also great cafes at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Artrsquos Modern One and Modern Two, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens, which are opposite Howard Place.BARRY DIDCOCKKelvin Walkway ndash Kelvin Aqueduct to Botanic GardensTime: Around  minutesWhat makes it special: In the heart of Glasgow, this walk transports you out of the hustle and bustle instantly ndash a breath of fresh airStarting at the Kelvin Aqueduct, follow the path down through the trees and emerge beside the River Kelvin. The roaring rapids quickly dissipate into calm ndash a haven for birds and other wildle. Itrsquos a matter of following the river, meandering past the remains of the North Woodside Flint Mill and under the huge archways of the Kirklee footbridge. The HaPenny Bridge, rebuilt in , is good for a game of Poohsticks or a nice place to stop and watch the river below. Even on a rainy day, the ancient trees and foliage are a good canopy to shelter under while you watch the dozens of dogs scampering by, swtly followed by their owners.If yoursquore feeling energetic, take a shot on the Scandinavian-style outdoor gym equipment close to the flint mill remains, or give it a miss and continue on until you reach a set of huge iron gates and a bridge crossing the river. At the other side, atop a set of steep, winding steps is the Botanic Gardens and civilisation once again.Pit stop: As itrsquos such a short walk, best focus on the end and make a beeline of the Botanic Gardens cafe once yoursquore done.HANNAH RODGERLanglands Moss, Langlands Road, East KilbrideTime: A leisurely woodland walk through the network of new paths and the forest takes about an hour to  minutes.What makes it special: Sweet-scented trees, an abundance of butterflies, birds and bees, and the knowledge that the peat bog is saving the planet by acting as a huge carbon sinkLanglands Moss is a little gem of a place, on the outskirts of the industrial estates at the southern edge of East Kilbride. The local nature reserve is managed by the mighty Friends of Langlands Moss volunteer conservation group and is a place of great beauty and importance, and a very pleasant spot to escape from the everyday. Schoolchildren and environmental groups have worked hard to preserve the peat bog and surrounding woodland, and there are now frog ponds and a wildflower meadow to admire, plus a network of forest paths. They can get muddy at times so sturdy footwear is essential, but all are accessible.Pit stop: There is no visitor centre, yet, at Langlands Moss, but just along the road in Auldhouse village sits The Lost Lamb, a fantastic restaurant adjacent to the long-standing pub the Auldhouse Arms. Perfect for a hearty lunch, or for relaxing in the outdoor seating area with a cold drink, admiring the countryside views.ANN FOTHERINGHAMAndyoure after something a bit more energetic ...Meikle Bin, Campsie FellsTime: - hoursWhat makes it special: Its a walk into the wilds for the reasonably fit through beautul countryside and rewarded by fantastic views, all within easy reach of the central beltI can see this hill from my bedroom window, and getting there is as much an adventure as climbing it. From Kilsyth, take the brilliantly named Tak-Ma-Doon Road across the Campsies and down to Carron Bridge. As you climb this ridiculously steep and windy road, you really feel yoursquore leaving any last hint of urban le behind.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneAs you drive along theof Carron Valley reservoir, Meikle Bin looms large on the skyline on your left. Stop at the car park at the western end and then just follow the path. Itrsquos simple, and beautul, and a great place to take the dog. Cross the bridge over the River Carron, and then its basically a steady but not-too-strenuous climb up through the woods. There are a number of turn-offs along the way, butyou stick to the main path its not too dficult to find your way. Keep going until you get to the path to the summit on the left.Now it gets serious, and steep, but there is the wreckage of a downed plane and a Christmas tree complete with decorationsto find. Besides, the view at the top makes it all worthwhile. Retrace your steps to get back down.Pitstop: On a hot day, take a picnic and stop at the bridge over the River Carron. Let the dog have a swim hellip in fact, why not go for a paddle yourself  Itrsquos a lovely spot.ANDY CLARK"},{"url":null,"title":"labour-heading-for-good-kicking-in-euro-poll-says-john-mcdonnell","story":"His comments come after deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said the party must ldquofind some backbone and fully commit to a second referendum on Brexit to have any chance of winning the next general election.Mr McDonnell said he understood Mr Watsonrsquos frustration, but that the party had been right to ldquotread a really dficult road of trying to bring Leave and Remain supporters back together.The shadow chancellor said Labour would pay an electoral price for that stance when European Parliament results begin to be announced late on Sunday.Mr McDonnell told Sky News: ldquoI think we most probably will get a good kicking in the election results tonight.ldquoWersquoll see.We are braced for that.He added: ldquoBut, you know, we had to do the responsible thing.ldquoIt was a hard road to follow.

I first came across his political commentary in the spring of  while studying at UC Berkeley, in Calornia.Milo Yiannapolous, the far-right British polemicist, had just been kicked off campus after students and anti-fascist protesters surrounded the building where he was due to speak and set fire to a floodlight with a molotov cocktail. And the ldquoalt-right, an umbrella term used to describe the majority of the far-right at the time, were angry.The definition of alt-right, short for alternative right, has been contested by academics and the movementrsquos erse nature makes it almost impossible to summarise.But it can broadly be classed as a set of far-right ideologies, such as white nationalism, anti-Semitism, anti-feminism and centrally, the right to free speech.Like any ideology, the movement has ious levels of intensity from extreme far-right neo-nazis, to those who pick and choose which aspects of the movement to uptake in order to remain socially acceptable.The alt-light is a term often used to describe the movements YouTube personalities, who tend to avoid voicing extreme views, but have been known to espouse many of the movementrsquos beliefs to their hundreds of thousands of followers.Mr Benjamin has previously been grouped in this category, but Mike Wendling, BBC journalist and author of Alt-Right: From chan to the White House, explained the term ldquointellectual dark web may more accurately describe him and the other YouTubers who descended on Berkeley that year.ldquoHersquos cultivated a fan base, hersquos cultivated quite a passionate fan base, but hersquos not alt-right, Mr Wendling said.ldquoHersquos explicitly said that he doesnrsquot believe in the alt-right.ldquoOn the other hand hersquos obviously very offensive. He claims to be for free speech but itrsquos more specic than that, itrsquos not really about free speech itrsquos about the freedom to offend people.Benjamin on the campaign trail in South West EnglandMr Benjamin and many other YouTubers from this so-called ldquointellectual dark web rallied on Berkeley in the name of ldquofree speech, when a number of other far-right speakers were banned from campus following the Milo shutdown.They documented the unfolding ideological clashes between controversial far-right figures and anti-fascistcounter protesters, but events quickly escalated to violence.During one protest, I witnessed a car drive through a crossroads full of people and carry on, full speed, out of the other side with a man clinging onto the bonnet.The incident happened just months before -year-old Heather Heyer was killed at another far-right protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, by James Alex Fields Jr., who also drove his car intentionally into a crowd.These YouTubers depicted the Berkeley protests like war zone.For example, well-known alt-light YouTuber, Canadian-born Lauren Southern, frequently used militaristic language in her content.She titled one video ldquoThe Battle for Berkeley and declared in another, ldquoWe took back lsquocommorniarsquo because of one terrible battle decision by the communists!When Mr Yiannapolous planned a ldquofree speech week on the campus in September that year, Mr Benjamin flew over to join his fellow \"dark web intellectuals\"., who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Mr Benjamin on stage with another YouTuber, Count Dankula , who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. \" class\"editor-image\"Mr Benjamin on stage with another YouTuber, Count Dankula , who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. The violence of the Spring protests had mostly subsided by September, but, like the other YouTubers before him, Mr Benjamin filmed his curbside political arguments with the counter-protesters.In a one-and-a-half hour ldquoFree Speech Documentary on his channel, you can see these arguments in full, as well as the  he gives to the notoriously violent Proudboys, an organisation which claims to be just a ldquopro-Trump drinking club.Speaking to one of their members Mr Benjamin said: ldquoDo you want to tell me about the Proudboys, because I have a funny feeling you guys get a lot of bad press and you donrsquot get to tell your story.This week, leaked chats from the group obtained by The Huffington Post, revealed they were discussing injuring and even killing their ldquoenemies.One message read: ldquoAll I want to do is smash commies too. Actually Irsquom lying, Irsquom way past just hitting them. When the time comes I will stop at nothing to fully eradicate them all!Read more:Boris Johnson under pressure over attacks on Scotlands public spendingIn  many U.S. commentators labelled the Berkeley protests as simply alt-right vs Anta, but ious ideologies existed on both sides and to call either a homogenous group would be a mistake.Nevertheless, through extensive analysis of the videos posted by Mr Benjamin and other ldquointellectual dark web YouTubers who attended the protests, it appeared they operated within an unofficial, online network.By interviewing one another, sharing each otherrsquos content and allowing the far-right voices to dominate over any other, YouTubers such as Mr Benjamin, Ms Southern, and even ex-VICE journalist Tim Pool, established what could be described as a pack mentality during the Berkeley protests.Mr Benjamin did not interview Anta protesters with any veil of journalistic professionalism, choosing instead to mock them in his videos. While when he interviewed far-right figures he gave them uninterrupted airtime to deliver their message.He also frequently used the content of the other far-right YouTubers who were attending the protests, which helped to push a joint narrative that the Anta were the violent ldquocommunist aggressors, while the ldquopro-free speech protestors were justied in their retaliation.Despite their assertions they were not part of any group, the YouTubersrsquo coverage clearly favoured the far-right protesters, in a classic display ofldquoin-group, out-group mentality.They labelled the Anta protesters as one indistinguishable violent faction, while the opposing side were seen as erse and acting in self-defence.Although Mr Benjamin and the other YouTubers videos garnered hundreds of thousands of views, did they actually have any offline effect \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Mr Benjamin was milkshaked while on the campaign trail this month \" class\"editor-image\"Mr Benjamin was milkshaked while on the campaign trail this month That September, Mr Yiannopoulos delivered a speech to a small crowd from the Sproul Steps on the UC Berkeleys campus.Dressed in a stars and stripes hoodie Mr Yiannopoulos shook hands with supporters and made a few dashed words before he was whisked away by bodyguards.The ldquointellectual dark web hailed it as a ldquovictory for free speech, and yet the furore and mass crowds that swelled during that year seemed to ebb away as quickly as they rose.Now Mr Benjamin has stepped out from behind his computer yet again, this time onto the political stage in Britain. But will his huge online fanbase, which donates thousands to him monthly via crowdfunding s, manest into support at the polls Mr Wendling doesnrsquot think so.ldquoIf you have a message that gets so many people riled up then surely you can convert that into a political messageyou do it the right way, he said.ldquoBut maybe that is the problem, maybe itrsquos simply a fact that the actual campaign is not as compelling as your YouTube videos.ldquoThe signicance is that they are people with large YouTube followings, who come from fairly provocative, offensive, or extreme right positions and they have not been able to translate that into a political movement.The majority of the media attention that has surrounded Mr Benjamin during his election bid has centred on the tweet he sent in , in which he said he ldquowouldnrsquot even rape Labour MP Jess Phillips.The tweet Mr Benjamin sent in . Mr Wendling added he has not conveyed ldquoany sort of philosophy during his campaign, ldquoall hersquos known for is a rape joke, he said.But the ability of online power to translate into electoral success is still yet to be proven on both sides of the political spectrum.Following the success of the Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S. one of the movementrsquos leaders, DeRay Mckesson, ran for mayor of Baltimore in .Despite rallying thousands of protestors for racial equality and having a strong online base with over , followers on Twitter, Mr Mckesson received just over , votes finishing in sixth place.ldquoTherersquos always been a disconnect between developing a large social media presence and turning that into a mainstream electoral success, Mr Wendling said.ldquoThe jury is definitely still out on the actual influence of social media.While out on the campaign trail Mr Benjamin has been doused in milkshakes, banned from election hustings and a police investigation has been launched following that  tweet.Despite naming his channel after a conqueror who is remembered as the first ruler of an ancient empire, it appears his political history may be recalled as one which was swtly extinguished by pound. milkshakes."},{"url":null,"title":"most-scots-blame-poor-wages-for-workers-claiming-benefit-says-survey","story":"A total of % of respondents to a YouGov poll for Citizens Advice Scotland gave this response when questioned on the reasons for claiming benefits.One in sixsaid they need extra to look after themselves or family members due to expenses such as illness or childcare.Just over a thirdbelieve claimants have been unlucky with their circumstances, such as accruing unexpected debts.Almost a fthbelieve benefits claimants \"are lazy and dont want to work more than they currently do\".The online survey of , adults also found that three quarters of peopleagreed workers on benefits work just as hard as anyone  and % agreed there should be more help for people to claim what they are entitled to.Around a thirdagreed thatbenefits were not so generous people would learn to stand on their own two feet, but % said cutting welfare payments would have a negative effect on the lives of many.More than halfbelieve people who rely on social security are in that situation through no fault of their own.However, more than a thirdsaid most people could managethey just budgeted sensibly, and % agreed the majority of benefits claimants have it easy because they get everything paid by the Government.The survey results have been released ahead of Citizens Advice Scotland launching a new campaign on Tuesday, aimed at encouraging people to get a financial health check through the organisation to ensure they are receiving payments for which they qualy.Citizens Advice Scotland chief executive Derek Mitchell said: \"This polling busts a series of myths around social security, and shows that the vast majority of people believe that our welfare state is there to help workers who need a hand, especially as the cost of living is soaring while wages have remained broadly the same.\"People should be claiming what they are due.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeedecided on Thursday, May  to introduce alternative arrangements to push up recycling rates and reduce materials sent to landfill. They approved an option to use households’ existing bins in a three-weekly collection cycle while officers continue to work to explore funding opportunities for further changes. One bin and a food waste caddy will continue to be collected every week meaning week one will start with general waste binsand food waste collected, week two will see Recycling binand food waste collected, and week three will also be a recycling bin and food waste collection.The materials that can be recycled on the kerbside remain the same - the only dference is that the blue-lidded recycling bin is emptied more often.The new service will be piloted in some areas in  and rolled out to the rest of Aberdeenshire in .Households will be contacted in advance by post.As over % of the waste produced in Aberdeenshire is recyclable using the existing recycling services, this change should allow an increased recycling rate, while work continues to seek other ways to push that up even further using kerbside services. ISC chair Peter Argyle said: “Clearly the decision by Zero Waste Scotland not to consider our funding bid has had a negative effect on our well-developed plans to push up Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate and send less recyclable materials to landfill.“This was not our first choice as a solution, but this is the position we find ourselves in and we feel that this option makes the most of a dficult situation and will help push up recycling rates. “At present, we see this as an interim measure, while we work to deliver a permanent scheme which provides a service for our residents which enables them to recycle as many materials as possible.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Meldrum Library is located at the Academy campus\"  Help Doctor Who by visiting library viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“One of the key things we continue to try to impress is that we want residents to simply think for a second about how they dispose of the waste they generate, then use the services we provide as best they can.” Vice chair John Cox said: “It can come as no surprise to anyone that councils are trying their hardest to offer services which push up recycling rates and make the most of recyclable materials. “I’m pleased officers have been able to come up with an interim alternative which keeps us moving in the right direction. “Although landfill capacity is essentially reduced,recycling services are used to their full capacity most households should be able to cope and the use of the food waste bin means there should be no additional hygiene issues either.”Other changes to be introduced under the new Waste Strategy are still going ahead – including improvements to Household Waste Recycling Centres from this month and an increased number of garden waste collection points across the area this summer.Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services."},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Instead, it’s about our ability to act as decent human beings, to use reasoned arguments against those we disagree with and,these fail, to agree to disagree in a spirit of civility,perhaps not always friendship.

But the continual improvement of financial services, driven in part by Scotland’s booming fintech sector, enables us to understand our spending better now than ever before.window.twttr “Cash rules everything around me,” was the refrain of “C.R.E.A.M”, by the Wu-Tang Clan, commenting on the big-spending US rap music scene in the s. But the music stars of the future are unlikely to have the same reverence for dollar bills, pound notes, or indeed any other kind of physical currency.Thanks to the rapid development of smartphones and financial technologies, we all now have the ability to pay for pretty much anything without ever having to visit a cash machine.And fintech companies are now working closely with the established banking giants to better understand how people engage with both money and technology.Whether it’s getting an approval for a mortgage, or simply saving for a rainy day, technology is helping tailor better products to help us achieve our financial goals.Such products may not inspire any pop or rap hits of the future, but they are already an invaluable tool for many people.To develop such a consumer-led approach, the country’s fintech firms are busy trying to understand what drives our spending.Stephen Ingledew, the chief executive of FinTech Scotland, has had years of experience in the financial sector, where he has played an active and major role in implementing \u2028customer-focused and technology-enabled initiatives.As a former senior executive for large companies, such as Standard Le and Barclays, as well as smaller financial enterprises, he is ideally placed to help both with mutually beneficial enterprises.“Organisations are not just focusing on the emotional side,” he says. “What we’re involved in is how fintech people engage with money and technology.“The interesting thing about fintech is it does not start with finance or technology – it starts with the human need. Then companies work back to find out how they can better serve that need. It could be spending, it could be saving, it could be anything to do with money.”Ingledew admits that in the past, the big banks often adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to products. However, he is confident that fintechs can help change that.“Because you start with a human point of view, you are more likely to actually meet people’s real needs,” he adds. “That’s something financial services has not always done very well in the past. It has tended to rather push products on people rather than start with the need. Fintech is turning that upside down.“Fintech is helping banks take a much more consumer-led approach, rather than simply trying to sell a product.”Role of moneyThe FinTech Scotland boss is understandably keen to promote the innovative work already being done north of the Border. He cites MoneyMatiX as one example of a fintech company which helps customers better understand where their cash comes from and where it goes each month.He says: “MoneyMatiX is all about helping people understand the role of money – they call it financial literacy. If you’ve got a better understanding, you can make better decisions – whether to spend, whether to save, how best to pay.Castlight Financial, which offers real-time affordability and financial capability analysis, is another.Ingledew says: “Castlight Financial, based in Glasgow, helps customers really understand their ability to borrow money. “Rather than taking a credit score, they are understanding someone’s behaviour. How money is going in and out, how they are spending. How that could be improved so they can get a low rate of interest when they borrow.“They are focused on behaviour. One of those aspects is people’s emotional responses to what we buy and how we spend it. “The key thing about data is that it’s not just about financial data, or looking at someone’s financial record in a very narrow way. “What affordability assessment does is look at people’s data. Two people may get the same salary but their behaviour may be very dferent. One may be very frugal, one may be very spendthrt. That’s where behaviour becomes very important – instead of just looking at where the money comes from and where it goes out.”While the average bank customer may not be intimately familiar with fintechs, that does not mean that they have not already benefitted from their work.“None of these fintechs are going to become household names in the near future, like HSBC or RBS. What they are doing is helping the big institutions to reinvent themselves,” Ingledew observes. “They are behind the scenes.”“The strength of Scotland is we have these big companies here. Scotland is a small market, but there is the ability to experiment by fintechs working alongside international companies based here.”Ingledew believes that products developed by the sector in Scotland could have a world-wide impact, saying: “The big opportunity is being able to reinvent banks around people and communities.“It’s not a given, but technology is the enabler that could allow that.\u2028If you apply the right kind of thinking – by starting with the human need – that provides the right kind of opportunity to bring in these new technologies to better understand their money than before.“To some degree that has already happened – we all have smartphones – but that doesn’t mean we’ve become much better educated on finance. So you have to ask what  can be done to make them feel more empowered with their money.”But what do the fintechs themselves have to say about emotion and how it drives our spending  Tynah Matembe and Helene Rodger, co-founders of MoneyMatiX, say theyfirst encountered financial illiteracy while working with young people who had no financial guidance because the adults and carers in their lives were financially illiterate themselves.The duo point to research which suggest parents in the UK pay out £. billion per annum in pocket money – an emotion-driven spendingever there was one – yet  per cent of parents are struggling to manage their own finances, let alone supporting their children.The pair have five children between them and they wanted to teach them the true value of money. MoneyMatiX, they say, was born out of the desire to create adult financial role \u2028models that can pass on healthy money habits to the next generation.“Our aim is to help transform lives by creating financially capable communities,” say Matembe and Rodger. “In our work, we remind people that besides death, dealing with money is the most unavoidable aspect of le.“Closely linked to this is the fact that people are emotional beings, meaning that all habits are a mixture of several learnings, experiences and exposure that merges into personalities.“Fintech companies like MoneyMatiX can help influence this phase of habit formation, which in turn influences spending practices.“Technology can help drive financial conversations and shape the experiences and exposure to money, helping create a healthy spending environment.“With the emergence of sophisticated technologies like articial intelligence and Blockchain, the opportunity to role-model healthy spending habits – especially for the next generation – is ripe.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ian blackford opposition mps may be unable to stop no deal brexit","story":"The SNPs Westminster leader has warned that opposition MPs could struggle to stop a no-deal Brexit.Ian Blackford said any proposition to halt Brexit by revoking Article  would have to have teeth and currently it is not clear that would be \"particularly easy\" to do.He said a no-deal Brexit would \"crash the economy\" and that Theresa Mays resignation means an increased threat of leaving the EU without a deal as a default on October .Speaking on the BBCs Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Blackford said: \"What were seeing at the moment seems to be a lurch to the right from the Conservative Party, they all seem to be outdoing each other on the no-deal Brexit stakes.\"I think, at the end of the day, there seems to be a very real risk to the people of Scotland, not just the people of Scotland but the people of the United Kingdom, in terms of that no-deal scenario.\"He called for a general election, a peoples vote and for Article  to be revoked.: Jim Sillars says impossible to vote for pro-EU SNP\"We need to make sure we can give teeth to any proposition to revoke Article , and at the moment it is not clear that,the Government doesnt bring forward legislation, its going to be particularly easy to do that,\" he added.\"What Theresa May was talking about was bringing forward a Bill that would be become an Act of Parliament and of course that could be amended and then would give us the option to revoke Article  but we simply dont know at this stage what a new prime minister will do.\"Askedany prime minister determined to take the UK out of the EU could do so by the default date by not doing much at all, Mr Blackford said: \"Im afraid that is the case.

not least over her handling of Brexit and her disregard for Scotland and the Scottish Government - leadership is not easy, and Theresa May should be thanked for her service.”But Ms Davidson was quick to warn that any potential leadership candidate must take a strong line against a second referendum in order to win her endorsement.“Theresa May knew when she took on the job of Prime Minister that the challenges facing our country were unprecedented,” Ms Davidson said“Her time in office has been characterised by the hard work, resilience, quiet dignity and attention to detail for which she is known.“Above all, by opposing the SNP’s call for an immediate second independence referendum in , the Prime Minister demonstrated her resolute commitment to the Union, and to Scotland’s place in it.“As Britain’s second female Prime Minister, she has been a role model for girls and women across the United Kingdom, showing that there is no glass ceiling to their ambitions.“As leader of the Scottish Conservatives, I want to see candidates show that same level of commitment to Scotland’s place in the Union, an ability to advance our interests at home and abroad and, crucially, demonstrate how they intend to bring our country back together after the isions sown by two constitutional referenda.”West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie who served as Mrs May’s parliamentary private secretary paid tribute.“It has been the privilege of my le to serve such a dedicated, loyal, patriotic and thoroughly decent woman,” he said.“We saw again today why we have been so lucky to have her as leader of our party and country.”Labour leader Richard Leonard said Mrs May leaves the country “more ided” and has fallen short on her promise to tackle the “burning injustices” in society.“She will leave the country in chaos as a direct result of her refusal to compromise over self-imposed red lines on Brexit,” she said.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mrs May faced “an impossible job” to deliver Brexit that would not damage the country. he said: “People have lost patience with the Conservatives.

Cross-border friction over demands for a repeat of the  referendum will step up a gear with the appointment of May’s successor in mid-July after a fast-track leadership contest was unveiled last week.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to seek a section  order, which would give Holyrood the legal authority to stage a second referendum, from the new occupant of Downing Street after the legislation for a referendum has begun its Parliamentary process at Holyrood.: Populist surge in EU polls will make prospect of Brexit deal even harder, say expertsIt is expected to be on the statute book by the end of the year. May has always ruled out a section  order and Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson has already warned any prospective UK leader must take a strong stand on Scotland’s place in the UK and rule out a second referendum.The growing expectation is that new leader could be Johnson, the former foreign secretary, who has indicated he could be ready to pursue a no-deal Brexit, prompting fears over the impact on Scotland’s economy and population growth. SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman said: “The prospect of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister is utterly horrying to people across Scotland, as he panders to calls from extreme Brexiteers to deliver a deeply damaging no-deal Brexit.“With Johnson the clear favourite to take over at No , it is absolutely no surprise that more and more people believe Scotland’s future should be as an independent country in the EU.“Andhe does actually make it to Downing Street, that will simply send support for independence soaring even higher.“A no-deal Brexit simply isn’t an option – it’s time to end this Westminster impasse and put the question back to the people with the option to remain on the ballot paper.”Plans to introduce Irish-style citizens’ assemblies in Scotland will also be set out by Russell in an update to MSPs. These would adopt a more collegiate approach to issues which “sharply ide” opinion and were unveiled by Sturgeon last month as she set out plans for a Holyrood Bill to enable a second referendum. Among the issues they will look at are the work required to give Scots the detail needed to make “informed choices about the future of the country”.Former SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson insisted many Scots No voters from  were already turning to independence.He branded Johnson an “old Etonian Bullingdon club buffoon” and warned the rest of the world was “watching agog” at the prospect of him taking over as Prime Minister.“In Scotland we are now facing Boris Johnson as prime minister and hard Brexit despite not voting for either,” he wrote.“It is the clearest, most extreme example of a democratic deficit imaginable.“This cannot be as good as it gets. The UK political system is broken and failing the people badly.“Massive pennies are dropping for many people who voted No in the  independence referendum.“What was previously unimaginable for them is now absolutely necessary.” But the prospect of Johnson or another hardline Brexiteer resulting in a huge spike in support for independence was played down by polling expert Sir John Curtice from the University of Strathclyde.“What we know about Boris is that he’s capable of reaching parts that most Tory leaders can’t reach,” Curtice said.“If he can win voters in inner London, why can’t he win voters in Scotland “The more serious point is what he does as leader.“I think what would be more relevant would bea Tory leader was to pursue no-deal, and that goes pear-shaped, then that might have an impact in Scotland. “But basically, because of the state of the House of Commons, that ain’t going to happen.“Thereafter, my argument would be it depends how he performs as prime minister and what he does and all the rest of it.“In the meantime, Boris may actually be the one person who’s capable of winning some votes back and might help the Tories in Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop. He had people coming from all over to buy it.“He was always reading and went back to get his Degree in History. He loved the horses, he was always saying I would ‘scud’ his bets, that I was the worst ‘picker in the world’.“At the end of the day he was a very hard working, very generous, honest man. All his le he would’ve said ‘I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this for you’, in terms of working so hard at the business. He loved his family.”Gerald’s daughter and Tom’s granddaughter, Charleen Straney, described her “granda” as “a much loved man and very highly thought of by everyone who got to know him.”Tom Straney’s Requiem Mass will take place todayin St Agnes’ Church at noon."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"finucane new lord mayor of belfast","story":"JOHN Finucane said his father was in his thoughts as he was officially made the new Lord Mayor of Belfast last night.The Sinn Féin councillor, a new face on Belfast City Council, was nominated by the party for the position of the city’s first citizen.John’s father, prominent Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane was shot dead in  by a state-controlled loyalist gang in front of his family.Speaking in the Chamber at the council’s AGM on Tuesday evening, John said: “Tonight is a special night for them and, of course, for me.“And of course never far from my thoughts, more so on a night like tonight, is my father Pat. “I know my dad would be proud tonight as my entire family are, as am I, of the position being elected Mayor of Belfast places me in.”John added that his focus for the year ahead will be on ersity and inclusiveness.“As Mayor, I want to bring a message of ersity and inclusiveness to the year ahead.“I have been brought up and lived my le in an inclusive, welcoming environment where dference and ersity are embraced and celebrated, and I am proud of that.“I am the product of a mixed marriage, of a Catholic father from West Belfast, and a Protestant mother from East Belfast. “I have relatives who are unionist and I have relatives who are republican. “My upbringing has shown me that everyone deserves to be, and must be, treated equally.“I want a strong, vibrant Belfast in which political persuasion, sexuality, religious choice or skin colour make no dference as to how a citizen is treated. “I want a Belfast where we champion the rights of the most vulnerable in our society and do so proudly, without fear, without favour.“I will never accept that undeniable rights are merely privileges, to be given and taken from those in need by those in power. “It is my intention as Mayor to convene a special conference to celebrate the vibrancy and ersity in this city and to show how that fantastic ersity can enrich our city and the lives of all our citizens.“As Mayor I will reach out the hand of friendship and do my best to help build a future we can all be proud of.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rio is on the ball on the springfield road","story":"FORMER Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand was in West Belfast on Tuesday to officially open the new office of one of the UK’s top football agencies at the Innovation Factory on the Springfield Road.Rio is an ambassador for New Era Global Sports Management, which is the first big name football agency to open an office in the North –their first office outside of London.New Era Global Sports believes in a holistic approach, supporting players throughout their careers and into retirement and Rio is hopeful the agency can make an impact here.“There has been so many good Irish players – Roy Keane, Robbie Keane, Jonny and Corry Evans, John O’Shea, Craig Cathcart, I could go on,” said Rio.“There are loads here and there will be more coming through.“It is about nurturing and creating the pathway for these players. The amount of lads leaving here for England but ing a year later is far too high. It is not about their football ability but due to a lack of support network for them.“There is that fear factor of moving away and we want to help them stay on the ladder.“It is an important moment for New Era. There is so much talent in Ireland and now we have a place to facilitate them.”The Innovation Factory office will be run by former professional footballer, Lee Mudd, who says the agency was drawn by the vast untapped potential talent throughout the island of Ireland.“There are a lot of talented young players here and having an office in Belfast will provide them with the opportunity to make it on a bigger stage. We currently have  players on our books from Ireland and Northern Ireland and I would expect this to grow considerably in a short time as there is so much potential here.“We recognise that it is an enormous challenge for a young person to leave this country and go to live in England. It is important to provide them with a support network. It can be a tough, ruthless environment and they need a caring team behind them to look after them, not just now but throughout their careers.”Lee points to the example of New Era Ambassador, Rio Ferdinand who has seen many highs and lows during his career and is now a successful businessman, media pundit and mentor to many young professionals.“Rio has been with New Era since the start and is the perfect example of how the company has helped him on his journey and shown him that there is a le after playing football. We want young players here to have access to all that experience.“We are in a growth phase and the Innovation Factory gives us the chance to build our business and increase capacity as needed. We also liked the networking opportunities with other businesses that have ambitious plans it offers us the chance to feed off this energy and new ideas”Shane Smith, Innovation Factory’s Community Engagement Officer added:“We are very excited to welcome such a prestigious sports agency to Northern Ireland.“New Era Sports has recognised the facilities and support we have to offer and we look forward to helping them expand their activities in Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph named uk regional newspaper of year","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on. I have to go on, I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit."},{"url":null,"title":"five key issues waiting in new psni chief byrnes intray","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The fatal flaws still remain. The backstop is still there meaning Northern Ireland could be cut off from its main market in Great Britain by a new regulatory border. \"Unless there are treaty level changes, Brussels would always have the whip hand.\"Mrs May yesterday set out a -point compromise package in her final attempt to secure approval for her deal, which has already been rejected in Parliament three times.She is to offer MPs a vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum in a last-ditch effort to secure support in the House of Commons.Her new Brexit deal, which was agreed by Cabinet only after a stormy two-hour session, will be brought to Parliament in the first week of next month.As well as a vote on a second referendum, MPs will be offered a choice over the UKs future customs arrangements with the European Union.TUV leader Jim Allister rounded on the Prime Minister for opening the door to a second referendum.

Effectively, it leaves us in the waiting room for Irish unity,\" he added.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle ONeill said: \"The majority of people of the North did not consent to Brexit and rejected it at the polls. \"The new offer announced by Theresa May contains little new thinking. Westminster is in chaos and what we heard today from Theresa May will do little to convince the business community or anyone  here that is likely to change.\"Ulster Unionist EU election candidate Danny Kennedy said: \"The very fact that the Prime Minister has made this speech less than  hours before polls open in an election to the European Parliament is symptomatic of the chaotic state of her Government at this time. The fact remains there should never have been a backstop in the first place and it was poor negotiations that resulted in its inclusion.\" Alliance leader Naomi Long said: \"Those saying the case for another vote was delusional have been proven wrong. We have not left the EU yet - the decision can be reversed and Brexit stopped.\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would consider the Prime Ministers plan, but warned: \"We wont back a repackaged version of the same old deal, and its clear that this weak and disintegrating Government is unable deliver on its own commitments.\"Mrs Mays proposals were immediately rejected by Tory Brexiteers.

But Mr Salvini is also looking to capitalise on the outcome of the European elections to boost his power at home in the League’s uneasy populist ruling coalition with the left-wing -Star Movement.Mr Salvini could use European electoral gains to leverage his position in the government and pass policies important to his base of northern Italian entrepreneurs, like a flat tax or the high-speed train connecting Lyon, France, with Turin.Most analysts believe he is unlikely to seek an early election in Italy, even with a big victory on the European stage. The -Star Movement, on the other hand, could decide to pull the plug on the coalition government.FRANCEFrance is looking at an epic battle between pro-EU centrist President Emmanuel Macron and anti-immigration, far-right flagbearer Marine Le Pen in the European Parliament vote, a duel over Europe’s basic values.A loss for Mr Macron’s Republic on the Move party would cripple the French leader’s grand ambitions for a more united Europe. He wants EU countries to share budgets and soldiers and work even more closely together to keep Europe globally relevant and prevent conflict.For Mr Macron, Ms Le Pen represents the “leprosy” of nationalism that is eating the EU from within. For Ms Le Pen, the race is a battle to preserve European civilisation from the threat of “massive immigration” and uncontrolled globalisation.As far-right parties court the youth vote, Ms Le Pen is counting on -year-old Jordan Bardella to lead her National Rally party to victory, then revamp the EU from within.Ms Le Pen’s party, then called the National Front, won France’s European parliamentary elections in , but now she is looking beyond home territory. She has travelled to numerous European capitals recently to lend support to populist candidates, with the goal of enlarging their parliamentary group.France has  lists of candidates in the European election, but Mr Macron crushed France’s traditional right and left parties in  when he won the presidency, and they are still struggling.GERMANYGermany’s governing parties look likely to lose some ground in the European Union’s most populous country, while the environmentalist Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany parties are eyeing gains.The vote is shaping up to be a particularly tough test for the centre-left Social Democrats, the junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition.They have been struggling badly in polls and there is widespread speculation that a poor performance could hasten the end of Mrs Merkel’s coalition government.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The poll results could put domestic pressure on Angela Merkel For Mrs Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union, it is the first test for new leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer since Germany’s longtime chancellor gave up her party’s leadership last year.The Greens have been soaring in polls, partly at the Social Democrats’ expense, and hope to convert that support into votes.And Alternative for Germany hopes to strengthen its presence in the European Parliament, adding to its strong contingent in Germany’s national legislature.Many of Germany’s  seats in the European Parliament are also likely to go to a iety of fringe parties.HUNGARYHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban describes the European Parliament vote as “decisive” for Hungary and Europe, an opportunity for populist and anti-migration forces to have a larger say in setting the agenda in Brussels.While his party’s victory in Hungary is unquestioned, where the allegiances of Mr Orban and his right-wing Fidesz party will lie after the election on the European scene is far less certain.Fidesz’s membership in the centre-right European People’s Party, currently the largest group in the EU legislature, was suspended in March because of concerns about the state of Hungary’s democracy. So Mr Orban has spent the past few weeks hosting far-right, nationalist and populist politicians at his new office in Buda Castle.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban casts his vote in Budapest He said he wants to stay in the centre-right bloc while getting the EPP to co-operate more closely with nationalist and populist parties like Matteo Salvini’s League in Italy. That notion has been emphatically rejected by leading politicians from the EPP, including Germany’s Angela Merkel.If Mr Salvini’s populists do well on Sunday, Mr Orban could leave the EPP and try to get some of the party’s more right-wing members to join Mr Salvini in a new, more radical alliance.While Hungary has largely stemmed migration, Mr Orban’s opposition to migrants still bears fruit, and pollsters expect Fidesz to win as many as  of Hungary’s  seats in the EU parliament.BRITAINBritain was not supposed to take part in the European Parliament elections at all, but had to organise a last-minute campaign when its planned March exit from the EU was postponed.The polling on Thursday came amid intense political turmoil sparked by the country’s  referendum to quit the EU. Embattled Prime Minister Theresa May will now step down as Conservative Party leader on June  after failing to deliver Brexit.Both Britain’s Conservatives and the Labour Party are predicted to be heading for an electoral pasting in the European vote due to the chaos over Brexit.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is likely to have done well in the poll The Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, has appeared to gain strength in recent voter surveys. Mr Farage said he hopes to have the shortest possible tenure as a European Parliament politician because he wants Britain to leave the EU as quickly as possible.The UK has  seats at the European Parliament, and its MEPs would lose their jobs when their country leaves the EU.AUSTRIASunday’s European Parliament vote in Austria has been upended by the sudden collapse of Austria’s governing coalition in a scandal that has tarnished the far-right Freedom Party. It will serve as a first test of support ahead of an early national election expected in September.Heinz-Christian Strache quit last weekend as vice chancellor and Freedom Party leader after a leaked video showed him appearing to offer favours to a purported Russian investor during a boozy meeting on the Spanish island of Ibiza two years ago.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s governing coalition collapsed amid scandal involving his deputy Heinz-Christian Strache Chancellor Sebastian Kurz then called for a new election and is now running an interim government with experts replacing the Freedom Party’s ministers.The European Parliament election should offer clues as to whether the popular Mr Kurz’s conservative People’s Party will benefit from the scandal.However, regardless of the result, Mr Kurz is expected to face a small opposition party’s no-confidence motion in parliament on Monday, and it is unclear whether he will keep his job."},{"url":null,"title":"earthquake strikes amazon jungle in peru","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Three schools, three hospitals and two churches were also affected.In Yurimaguas, a number of old houses collapsed, and the electricity was cut, according to the National Emergency Operations Centre.The quake also woke up people in Lima, who ran out of their homes in fear.“It was a really long quake,” said Maria Brito, who lives on the fth floor of an apartment building in the capital. “It could’ve been worse, and luckily it’s over.”Peru lies on the Pacic’s so-called Ring of Fire.

Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget.

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny,

compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

Some Barbadoes gentlemen, then at Martinique, coming off to wait on Capt. Reddish, the French man of war’s boat, that was rowing from the shore to the ship, took the Barbadians and carried them on board the French man of war whereupon Capt. Reddish sent his lieutenant to demand instant satisfaction for the insults done to the king of Great Britain’s subjects, even under the nose of one of his ships of war. On this the French Captain disown’d any orders of his to the officer in the boat, reprimanded him for meddling with the gentlemen, and made him ask for their pardon and thus the whole matter ended, intirely to the honour of our Captain, and to the satisfaction of us all who wish to hear the ancient English language spoke on board our ships.SAXONY.Dresden, May , N.S.The king of Poland has ever since histo this capital, been confined to his room by a slight intermitting fever, occasioned by a cold, and attended with pain and a little inflamation in one leg.Gibraltar, April , .From on board his Majesty’s Ship the Somerset.Upon our arrival here from Port-Mahon, general Sabine sent a message to Admiral Hadddock, to acquaint him, that a Spanish frigate had taken out a vessel belonging to Gibraltar several Moors upon which Admiral Haddock wrote to the Spanish admiral at Carthagena, and sent lord Augustus Fitzroy, to demand satisfaction, which was immediately given, the Moors with their effects were deliver’d up, and a most obliging answer sent to our admiral.LONDON, May . It was yesterday currently reported, that the Fleet of ten French men of war, was ready to sail from Brest to the Baltick we are likewise inform’d that a squadron of fteen British men of war will be sent by way of observation to those seas.Terry Bradley: A portrait of the artist Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It’s talked about town that the king of Spain has absolutely refused the ,l. stipulated by the Convention, and to give up his pretended right of searching our ships, ‘till we have delivered up Georgia and Gibraltar into their hands. If this be true a War is unavoidable.Yesterday we received advice from New England, that a ship commanded by Capt.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Members of local chapels and churches processed from the Twyn through Dinas Powys passed Tesco at Nica, ending at Bethesda Chapel.Fish and chips sustained around  walkers by the end of the evening.Rev Jon Davis of the Baptist Church and the Revs Carole and Phil Challis of the Methodists led the service with the first hymn, Light of the World. The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So can the Secretary of State explain what he has done to offset the lost opportunity for Welsh steel producers of the lost Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the electrication to Swansea \"What projects has he actually secured to provide procurement opportunities for Welsh steel producers  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is a piece of disused waste groundwe have had it signed over to us. Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“Pat will come over and he will introduce his Train B Smart and we can work out of his Hub.“Early intervention is key to get those children knowing the mental and physical well-being is the way forward. That will also have a bigger influence then on the parents and the wider community.”Ms Andrews is mindful that the school pitch is currently unused because of the anti-social behaviour. She is keen that this project moves forward for the sake of the children and the community.“But without the funding, we can’t move forward. The EA has already signed over the pitch and council are working hard to give us the waste ground behind it but without a working Assembly, I am afraid this will be a missed opportunity.Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“We need £, to make this project work and start building the Train B Smart Hub at Tullygally Primary School,” she said.But the Hub won’t be just for Tullygally PS, as Pat explains: “The whole idea with Train B Smart is for the local and wider community to be able to participate in multi-sports. That’s the key aim. We know not everybody is going to be an elite athlete, that’s not the point. The point is that everybody can get enjoyment out of it. This is why the children are here.

clearly nervous, out-shone her three fellow contestants and scooped £k for the team.Single-mum Libby appeared on the popular show last Friday - a secret she had kept from her colleagues at The Asburn Hotel.“I was shaking like a leaf on the show,” she said.But Libby held her own against The Chaser - Jenny ‘The Vixen’ Ryan - even though the contestant who went before her was ousted. And she scooped a fantastic £, for the pot.Libby, who has had her eye on taking part in The Chase for many years, described the show’s host, comedian Bradley Walsh as ‘so charming and funny’.Even though he nearly got her into hot water with The Ashburn’s chef Micky McLaughlin.Laughing she said Bradley had asked her on the showMicky was like Gordon Ramsay.“There was a lot said about Micky on the show but some of it was cut out,” she revealed.The show was filmed last October and Libby said it was hard to keep it from her workmates.Her daughter Chloe, who works part time as floor staff in the restaurant, knew about it but was sworn to secrecy.“I thought I had to pre-warn chef Micky as he was mentioned on the show but didn’t tell him how I got on,” said the Kilwilkie woman.A former pupil at Tannaghmore PS and St Mary’s Junior High School, Libby puts down her ability for quizzes to her avid book reading.The Royal visit to Northern Ireland continued as the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Brownlow House, Lurgan Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She watches quiz shows regularly and takes part in a lot of radio quizzes.She told Bradley Walsh thatshe won the money she would renovate a spare room into a library for all her books and as a craft room for her crochet hobby.Asked why she had applied for the show, she said: “It was on my bucket list. I always wanted to go on a quiz show. Then I hit  and hadn’t done it and then I did  and I was determined to do it.“I applied and went for an audition in Belfast and got on the show,” she said.And she isn’t stopping there with plans afoot to hopefully take part in The Tipping Point.She has plenty more things on her bucket list to achieve including a bungee jump and sky ing, plus a trip to Australia to see her three nieces.Though he didn’t appear on The Chase, Lurgan chef Micky McLaughlin is now known by the millions who watch the show.The -year-old chef said: “We are all very proud of her. The rest of the team did nothing. She was the one who got the £, cashbuilder.”Paul McConaghy, owner of The Ashburn Hotel, said everyone was ‘very proud of her’.“She was unreal.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones.
