Morrisons on Tuesday reported a big sales increase, while retail analysts Kantar said December was a record month for UK supermarkets. That has led to soaring revenues, although profits have been held back by significant extra costs involved with bringing in social distancing measures.The profits are expected even after the supermarket belatedly pledged to pay back £410m in business rates relief given by the government at the start of the pandemic. The relief had been given on the expectation that supermarkets and other retailers would suffer, but essential shops that remained open instead reported sales increase. Sainsbury’s, B\u0026ampM and a host of other retailers only pledged to pay back the relief after a public outcry.Simon Roberts, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said the company was “dealing with a lot of change and uncertainty again” during England’s third national lockdown, but added that there were opportunities for 2021.B\u0026ampM, which sells items ranging from frozen foods to plants and homewares, has been another of the most prominent beneficiaries.

The virus was rampant in the country and measures to stop it were draconian. For nearly three months I lived in virtual confinement with the occasional visit to the corner shop being my only respite – my only chance to see people other than a rare visit from the postman. We were not even permitted to take exercise.I was based in Mérida, a city in the south west. The front of my flat overlooked an incredibly ugly secondary school – out back on the terrace, the skyline was dominated by chimneys and satellite dishes. There was not a lick of green to be seen. As many will have experienced, it was a very tough time.The only thing that pulled me out of my doldrums was nature: from my small terrace, watching the daily flights of various birds of prey, including black and griffon vultures, lifted me no end. As did the a male spotless starling, whose home territory included a television aerial on a nearby rooftop. I watched him claim his coveted song post, singing his heart out, attracting several females, mating with one of them and eventually bringing his family back to the aerial where it all began. There was something very satisfying about seeing nature unfold in daily episodes.I was not alone in finding solace with nature, and particularly in birds. People noted the abundance of song and sheer number of birds in their neighbourhoods, sometimes truly seeing this for the first time. Stuck at home without the omnipresent hubbub of the white noise that we create in our streets – car horns blaring, people out and about – we were noticing more of the nature that has always been around us. Back then, in April and May, we were also blessed with fine weather that made some aspects of lockdown just that little bit more bearable.This new phase of lockdown may be rather different. We are fatigued by the virus and weighed down by the thought of more short, dark and cold days stuck at home, away from any feasible social life or even family contact. But now is the moment to turn to nature to help us through – there is still lots to see and hear out there. When going out for a daily walk, be mindful that there are always birds to be spotted. In an urban area, keep an eye out for roving flocks of tits as you pass bushes and trees in front gardens and parks. The more recognisable blue, great and long-tailed tits are sometimes joined by coal tits, nuthatches, treecreepers and chiffchaffs – these are normally summer visitors that have taken to wintering in the UK in ever-increasing numbers.But even glancing at the feral pigeons that inhabit our streets can be a pleasure: ignore their “flying rat” moniker and instead think of them as magnificent flying machines that in level flight are capable of outflying the mighty peregrine – another newly urbanised denizen.Before 2020, not many people living in the vicinity of Wormwood Scrubs, my west London birding haven, ever seemed to venture on to its hallowed turf. Now, it has become a mecca for those who have recently discovered its understated wild beauty. And it’s not just the usual suspects of dog walkers and joggers. The people I see using the park are from all walks of life: they may have first come here simply to get some outdoor sanctuary amid difficult pandemic days, but they are also experiencing wonderful slices of nature. Similar scenes are being played out across the nation. The weather may not be particularly pleasant for the next few months, but it’s still worth wrapping up and getting yourself out there. Rediscover the parks that you frequented during the summer months. Of course, they will look different now, but spare the time as you walk to marvel at the gulls that have collected on the playing fields. A brief scan may reveal numbers of starlings, crows and possibly winter thrushes such as redwings and fieldfares in their midst too. We all need to take care of ourselves during this new stage of lockdown, and I have found that engaging in the nature that surrounds us certainly helps. All you have to do is get outside, take a deep breath and look up!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cffb1db654f1534ff26293adc45bab3e6c11448/123_642_2901_1740/master/2901.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=c6b2ab40cf36c1bbdc07172d3d33d4f5","title":"a level and gsce students how are you feeling about exams","story":"We would like to hear from students in England about their reaction to summer exams likely being cancelledThe education secretary is due to make a statement in the Commons on Wednesday saying summer exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England.

You can plan and plan and plan. You can have a manager who is famous for his attention to detail. You can study all the data, watch all the videos, think and plot and cogitate, formulate your grand strategy, then it turns out the answer all along was John Stones.Manchester City needed a right-sided central defender, everybody said. They had Aymeric Laporte, who was probably alongside Virgil van Dijk the best central defender in the league, but he prefers the left side, so City’s job in the summer was to find somebody to play alongside him. In that area, it was widely agreed, their recruitment had gone a little awry.They signed Nathan Aké from Bournemouth for £41m, the first senior central defender City had signed since Laporte in January 2018. But one who plays on the left. A squad player, then: cover, back-up for Laporte. Aké played in the first two games of the season, in the second of which City let in five against Leicester. He has started only three league games since, and given the last two of those were against West Brom and Newcastle United, two of the five lowest-scoring sides in the ision, it’s fair to say his role is to be used against less threatening opponents to rest the frontline.But then City pounced. Rúben Dias, for £61.5m plus Nicolás Otamendi. A right-sided central defender, the first senior player City had bought in that position since Stones in August 2016. This, then, was the future: Dias and Laporte, the rock on which Pep Guardiola’s new cathedral would be built.And Dias has excelled this season. Few central defenders have adapted quite so unobtrusively into the Premier League, with all its long diags and elbows and second balls. His unruffled authority, the galvanising effect he has had, has drawn comparison to Van Dijk, which may be premature but is not unreasonable. The difference between City now and the porousness of the Leicester game is profound.But he hasn’t done it on the right of central defensive pairing he’s done it on the left and alongside him is Stones. The solution, it turns out, was there all along.Stones is one of those unfortunate players who has become a cipher for a wider debate. It’s never just about him or his form: conversations always end up in debates about the nature of defending and how central defenders should behave. As soon as Everton signed him from Barnsley, he became the icon of a new age: an angular, slightly gawky figure more notable for his reading of the game and his passing than for the more traditional defensive arts of heading, tackling and marking.It’s a concept with which English football has never been entirely comfortable. Stones made errors, as all young defenders will, as all defenders will, particular those asked to play in the proactive way he is, and each one felt like a blow on the whole concept of defending he represents. The nadir perhaps came in England’s defeat against the Netherlands in the Nations League semi-final in 2019. However many mistakes could be tolerated for the benefits brought by his willingness to pass out from the back, this was too many.Form and confidence disintegrated. Last season he started only 12 league games. He played only one of the first nine this season. At 26, he felt like yesterday’s man. But then he came into the team against Burnley at the end of November. Since then, when he has been on the pitch, the only goal City have conceded is Callum Hudson-Odoi’s largely inconsequential late strike for Chelsea on Sunday.Against Manchester United on Wednesday, the Stones-Dias partnership was exceptional again, and Stones’s goal a welcome bonus. United didn’t play badly in a high-quality game, but the threat they offered was restricted largely to a couple of long-range efforts, a handful of set plays and some extremely optimistic appeals for penalties. Fernandinho was superb, not only in his goal, but in the way he protected the space in front of Stones and Dias, stifling Bruno Fernandes.City this season have been scratchy. They’ve lacked their usual flow. When they drew at home with West Brom, it seemed reasonable to wonder whether this might be the worst side of which Guardiola had ever been in charge. But against Chelsea and then again on Wednesday, there was a zip to their football. In 12 games since the defeat at Tottenham, they’ve conceded only three times.The question was how well the new partnership would stand up against a strong counterattacking side. Here, perhaps, was the beginning of an answer. United beat City three times last season, each time by sitting deep and playing on the break. In the league meeting last month, Guardiola was so concerned by United’s counter he had his side sit off and essentially accept a 0-0. There was no such caution on Wednesday.City in spells looked back to their fluent best, and that is part down to the sense of security the defence gives them. In Stones’s resurgence, perhaps, there is a reminder that players are not mere bundles of attributes and statistics. They have lives beyond the pitch. Form and confidence can fluctuate. A few bad games, a few bad months, shouldn’t mean a player is written off for ever. They are human and therefore unpredictable. Planning can only ever go so far. This may be a formula that has been stumbled upon, but City are starting to look hugely impressive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dce577f1e8434ee1e444d0dda057b6ef94b522/0_87_4503_2702/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e629495c60596e45c163390224db69f","title":"colin bell a life in pictures","story":"The ‘King of the Kippax’ has died aged 74 after a short illness – we take a look back at the career of the legendary Manchester City midfielder"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe1987e5d1df93e1f45f924dbea9467b78aa8b8e/631_358_4643_2788/master/4643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3648aadd82261cfe691b3debc2801e9","title":"the joys of being an absolute beginner for life","story":"The phrase ‘adult beginner’ can sound patronising. It implies you are learning something you should have mastered as a child. But learning is not just for the youngOne day a number of years ago, I was deep into a game of draughts on holiday with my daughter, then almost four, in the small library of a beachfront town. Her eye drifted to a nearby table, where a black-and-white board bristled with far more interesting figures (many a future chess master has been innocently drawn in by “horses” and “castles”).“What’s that?” she asked. “Chess,” I replied. “Can we play?” she pleaded. I nodded absently.There was just one problem: I didn’t know how. I dimly remembered having learned the basic moves as a kid, but chess had never stuck. This fact vaguely haunted me through my life. I would see an idle board in a hotel lobby or a puzzle in a weekend newspaper supplement, and feel a pang.I had picked up a general awareness of chess. I knew the names Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. I knew that the game had enchanted historical luminaries including Marcel Duchamp and Vladimir Nabokov. I knew the cliche about grandmasters being able to look a dozen moves ahead. I knew that chess, like classical music, was shorthand in movies for genius – often of the evil variety. But I knew chess the way I “knew” the Japanese language: what it looks like, what it sounds like, its Japaneseness, without actually comprehending it.I decided to learn the game, if only to be able to teach my daughter. It took a few hours, hunched over my smartphone at kids’ birthday parties or waiting in line at Trader Joe’s, to get a feel for the basic moves. Soon, I was playing, and some-times even beating, the weakest computer opponents (the ones with catastrophic blunders abundantly programmed in). Yet it soon became apparent that I had little concept of the larger strategies. I didn’t want to try to teach what I knew only poorly.And yet, how to learn? The number of chess books was dauntingly huge. Sure, there was Chess for Dummies. But beyond that, the chess literature was enormous. It was filled with algebraic-looking thickets of chess notation, a quasi-language that itself had to be learned. And the books were achingly specific: for example, A Complete Guide to Playing 3 Nc3 Against the French Defence.That’s right: an entire book devoted to the permutations of a single move – a move that, I should add, has been regularly played for a century. Yet people were still figuring out, 100 years and many chess books later – 288 pages’ worth of new things to say about it.A well travelled fact that one hears early in chess is that after only three moves, there are more possible game variations than there are atoms in the universe. And, indeed, I felt cosmically stupefied as I tried to figure out how to boil down this exponentially complex game to someone whose favourite show was Curious George.So I did what any self-respecting modern parent does: I hired a coach. The twist was that I wanted someone to teach my daughter and me at the same time.For most of us, the beginner stage is something to be got through as quickly as possible, like a socially awkward skin condition. But even if we’re only passing through, we should pay particular attention to this moment. For once it goes, it’s hard to get back.Think of a time when you first visited a new, distant place, one with which you were barely familiar. Upon arrival, you were alive to every novelty. The smell of the food in the street! The curious traffic signs! The sound of the call to prayer! Flushed from the comfort of your usual surrounds, forced to learn new rituals and ways to communicate, you gained sensory superpowers. You paid attention to everything because you didn’t even know what you needed to know to get by. After a few days, as you became more expert in the place, what seemed strange began to become familiar. You began noticing less. You became safer in your knowledge. Your behaviour became more automatic.Even as your skills and knowledge progress, there is a potential value to holding on to that beginner’s mind. In what’s come to be known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, the psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger showed that on various cognitive tests the people who did the worst were also the ones who most “grossly overestimated” their actual performance. They were “unskilled and unaware of it”.This can certainly be a stumbling block for beginners. But additional research later showed that the only thing worse than hardly knowing anything was knowing a little bit more. This pattern appears in the real world: doctors learning a spinal surgery technique committed the most errors not on the first or second try, but on the 15th pilot errors, meanwhile, seem to peak not in the earliest stages but after about 800 hours of flight time.I’m not suggesting experts have much to fear from beginners. Experts, who tend to be “skilled, and aware of it”, are much more efficient in their problem-solving processes, more efficient in their movement (the best chess players, for example, tend also to be the best speed-chess players). They can draw upon more experience, and more finely honed reflexes. Beginner chess players will waste time considering a huge range of possible moves, while grandmasters zero in on the most relevant options (even if they then spend a lot of time calculating which of those moves are best).And yet, sometimes, the “habits of the expert”, as the Zen master Suzuki called it, can be an obstacle – particularly when new solutions are demanded. With all their experience, experts can come to see what they expect to see. Chess experts can become so entranced by a move they remember from a previous game that they miss a more optimal move on a different part of the board.This tendency for people to default to the familiar, even in the face of a more optimal novel solution, has been termed the Einstellung effect (after a German word that means “set”).In the famous “candle problem”, people are asked to attach a candle to the wall using nothing more than a box of matches and a box of tacks. People struggle to solve it because they get hung up on the “functional fixedness” of the box as a container for tacks, not as a theoretical shelf for the candle. There is one group, it turns out, that tends to do pretty well on the candle problem: five-year-olds.Why? The researchers who found this suggest that younger children have a more fluid “conception of function” than older children or adults. They are less hung up on things being for something, and more able to view them simply as things to be used in all sorts of ways. Small wonder they conquer new technology so handily everything is new for them.Children, in a very real sense, have beginners’ minds, open to wider possibilities. They see the world with fresher eyes, are less burdened with preconception and past experience, and are less guided by what they know to be true.They are more likely to pick up details that adults might discard as irrelevant. Because they’re less concerned with being wrong or looking foolish, children often ask questions that adults won’t ask.No one wants to stay a beginner. We all want to get better. But even as our skills improve, and our knowledge and experience grow, what I hope to encourage is the preservation, or even cultivation, of that spirit of the novice: the naive optimism, the hypervigilant alertness that comes with novelty and insecurity, the willingness to look foolish, and the permission to ask obvious questions – the unencumbered beginner’s mind.What the chess master Benjamin Blumenfeld advised a century ago applies as much to life as to chess: “Before you make your move, look at the position as if you were a beginner.”When my daughter first began competing in school chess tournaments, I would often chat to other parents. Sometimes, I’d ask if they played chess themselves. Usually, the reply was an apologetic shrug and a smile. When I volunteered that I was learning to play, the tone was cheerily patronising: “Good luck with that!” I thought: “If this game is so good for kids, why are adults ignoring it?” Seeing someone playing Angry Birds, I wanted to tap them on the shoulder and say: “Why are you having your kids do chess while you do that? This is the game of kings! There are chess games recorded from the 15th century!”At chess tournaments, I saw a dynamic that was all too familiar from the world of children’s activities: kids doing the activity, and adults like me staring into their smartphones.Sure, we parents had work to do, work that we allowed to spill into weekends, work that helped pay for the lessons our kids were enjoying (or enduring). But I also wondered if we, in our constant chaperoning of these lessons, were imparting a subtle lesson: that learning was for the young.Strolling down the hall during one tournament, I looked into a classroom and saw a group of parents with what I took to be an instructor. They were playing chess! Just then, as if on cue, a group of kids passed me, peering in on the same scene. “Why are adults learning chess?” one asked, in a vaguely mocking tone, to the collective amusement of the group. They marched on while I slowly died in front of a cheery bulletin board.I was tired of sitting on the sidelines. I wanted in. And that is how I got a membership card from the US Chess Federation and started throwing myself in.Early on, I was nervous, even though I really had nothing to lose, save my pride. “A master can sometimes play badly,” as one grandmaster put it, “a fan, never!” And fan I was: the sombre rituals, the pulse-pounding encounters, the tense atmosphere. It was three hours of sustained concentration and intense thinking, with my phone turned off. It felt like a gym for the brain.Being a beginner can be hard at any age, but it gets harder as you get older. Children’s brains and bodies are built for doing, failing, and doing again. We applaud virtually anything they do, because they are trying.With adults, it’s more complicated. The phrase “adult beginner” has an air of gentle pity. It reeks of obligatory retraining seminars and uncomfortable chairs. It implies the learning of something that you should have perhaps already learned.There is safety in sticking with what we’re already good at. “It’s hard to be old and bad at something,” as a friend, returning to hockey after many decades, put it. We can be so put off by being a beginner that we forget we were once beginners in all sorts of things, until we were not.Adult beginners face their own version of what is known by sporting coaches as “stereotype threat”, whereby a negative image becomes associated with a particular group of players, and leads them to repeat mistakes – in this case, one that says it’s harder to learn when you’re older. There’s a pernicious, goading little voice: “You’ve started too late. Why bother?” One day, at her swimming lesson, I was impressed to see my daughter “flip turn” at the end of the lane while doing a backstroke. This is not something I can do. “How’d you learn to do that?” I asked. “You have to be a kid,” she responded matter-of-factly.As I was finding out, this kind of idea is deeply ingrained in chess. There seems to be a relation between the age at which you first learned the game and your later success in tournaments. This idea is so pervasive that Magnus Carlsen, the current No 1, is held as a fascinating outlier. “At five years old,” one account marvels, “an age by which any aspiring grandmaster should at least have made a start, Magnus Carlsen showed little interest in chess.”Sitting down against younger opponents, I tried to keep in mind a bit of advice gleaned from the  writer Stephen Moss’s book The Rookie: just face them the way you would anyone else.This could be hard. The way they played just threw me. In the face of my agonised dithering, they would launch fast, brute-force attacks – sometimes effective, sometimes foolhardy. “Children just kind of go for it,” Daniel King, the English grandmaster and chess commentator, told me. “That kind of confidence can be very disconcerting for the opponent.”Young children, for example, have been shown to be faster and more accurate at tests involving “probabilistic sequence learning” – the sort in which people must guess which triggers will lead to what events (for example, if you press button A, event X will happen).After the age of 12, this ability begins to decline. As researchers suggest, people start relying more on “internal models” of cognition and reasoning, instead of what they see right in front of them. In other words, they overthink things. In chess games, where my adult opponents often seemed to battle unseen internal demons, the kids just seemed to twitch out a series of moves.I was buying into the stereotype threat. If I lost to an adult, I would chalk it up to my own stupid errors. But if I lost to a child, I would suddenly imagine them as some incipient genius against whom I never had a chance.When I asked our chess coach about what it was like to teach adult chess beginners as opposed to child chess beginners, he thought for a moment and said: “Adults need to explain to themselves why they play what they play.” Kids, he said, “don’t do that”. He compared it to languages: “Beginner adults learn the rules of grammar and pronunciation and use those to put sentences together. Little kids learn languages by talking.”The analogy goes deeper than we might think. My daughter was, in effect, learning chess like a first language, whereas I was learning it like a second language. Even more important, she was learning it young.Language is one of those endeavours (like music, and perhaps chess) that seems to flourish best if learned during a so-called “sensitive period” in which, as one researcher has described it, “neural systems are particularly responsive to relevant stimuli, and are more susceptible to change when stimulated”.By contrast, because I am an adult, expert speaker of English, my brain may be so “tuned” to the sounds of my native language that it is harder for me to take on new grammar. What I know already gets in the way of what I want to learn. Kids, by knowing less, can actually learn more (the cognitive scientist Elissa Newport calls it the “less-is-more hypothesis”).Harder does not mean impossible. “Sensitive” periods are not “critical” periods, and the science, in any case, is not conclusive. The skill of having perfect pitch, for example, which is not only exceedingly rare but has long been thought to be impossible outside a narrow age range in childhood, can be trained in some adults, as research from the University of Chicago has shown (albeit to not quite as high a level as those possessing “true” perfect pitch).Kids often make more progress simply because they are kids, with lives built largely around learning, having few other responsibilities, and with eager parents to cheer them on. They are also motivated: if you were dropped into an entirely new setting, the way infants are, and found that you couldn’t communicate, you’d probably learn pretty quickly.You may, by now, be rightly asking, why should I bother learning a bunch of things that aren’t relevant to my career? Why dabble in mere hobbies when I’m scrambling to keep up with the demands of a rapidly changing workplace?First, I might suggest that it’s not at all clear that learning something like singing or drawing actually won’t help you in your job – even if it’s not immediately obvious how.Learning has been proposed as an effective response to stress in one’s job. By enlarging one’s sense of self, and perhaps equipping us with new capabilities, learning becomes a “stress buffer”.Claude Shannon, the brilliant MIT polymath who helped invent the digital world in which we live today, plunged into all kinds of pursuits, from juggling to poetry to designing the first wearable computer. “Time and time again,” noted his biographer, “he pursued projects that might have caused others embarrassment, engaged questions that seemed trivial or minor, then managed to wring breakthroughs out of them.”Regularly stepping out of our comfort zones, at this historical moment, just feels like life practice. The fast pace of technological change turns us all, in a sense, into “perpetual novices”, always on the upward slope of learning, our knowledge constantly requiring upgrades, like our phones. Few of us can channel our unided attention into a lifelong craft. Even if we keep the same job, the required skills change. The more willing we are to be brave beginners, the better. As Ravi Kumar, president of the IT giant Infosys, described it: “You have to learn to learn, learn to unlearn, and learn to re-learn.”Second, it’s just good for you. I don’t mean only the things themselves – the singing or the drawing or the surfing – are good for you (although they are, in ways I’ll return to). I mean that skill learning itself is good for you.It scarcely matters what it is – tying nautical knots or throwing pottery. Learning something new and challenging, particularly with a group, has proven benefits for the “novelty-seeking machine” that is the brain. Because novelty itself seems to trigger learning, learning various new things at once might be even better. A study that had adults aged 58 to 86 simultaneously take multiple classes – ranging from Spanish to music composition to painting – found that after just a few months, the learners had improved not only at Spanish or painting, but on a battery of cognitive tests. They’d rolled back the odometers in their brains by some 30 years, doing better on the tests than a control group who took no classes.They’d changed in other ways, too: they felt more confident, they were pleasantly surprised by their work, and they kept getting together after the study ended.Skill learning seems to be additive it’s not only about the skill. A study that looked at young children who had taken swimming lessons found benefits beyond swimming. The swimmers were better at a number of other physical tests, such as grasping or hand-eye coordination, than non-swimmers. They also did better on reading and mathematical reasoning tests than non-swimmers, even accounting for factors such as socio-economic status.Many of these studies or recommendations are oriented toward children. Chess, for example, is held up as a way to improve children’s focus and concentration, to strengthen their problem-solving skills, to bolster their creative thinking. But I’ve become convinced that whenever something is touted as being good for children, it’s even better for adults, in part because we assume we no longer need all those benefits an activity is said to provide.And yet what better remedy for the widespread affliction of “smartphone addiction” than two hours of burning your eyes and brain into 64 squares on a board, trying to analyse an almost infinite variety of moves and countermoves?Learning new skills also changes the way you think, or the way you see the world. Learning to sing changes the way you listen to music, while learning to draw is a striking tutorial on the human visual system. Learning to weld is a crash course in physics and metallurgy. You learn to surf and suddenly you find yourself interested in tide tables and storm systems and the hydrodynamics of waves. Your world got bigger because you did.Last, if humans seem to crave novelty, and novelty helps us learn, one thing that learning does is equip us with how to better handle future novelty. “More than any other animal, we human beings depend on our ability to learn,” the psychologist Alison Gopnik has observed. “Our large brain and powerful learning abilities evolved, most of all, to deal with change.” We’re always flipping between small moments of incompetence and mastery. Sometimes, we cautiously try to work out how we’re going to do something new.Sometimes, we read a book or look for an instructional video. Sometimes, we just have to plunge in. • Beginners: The Curious Power of Lifelong Learning by Tom Vanderbilt is published by Atlantic and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46d2a8107fc676b7f9fe995a11bcc41bb05161e2/0_6_5222_3134/master/5222.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=17496957dd99fca7d04287a9d56a21d5","title":"leisure facilities face 90m a week loss under uk winter covid 19 lockdown","story":"The winter lockdown will cost Britain’s gyms, swimming pools and leisure facilities a combined £90m a week in lost revenue, according to new analysis from ukactive, which is calling for urgent government help to protect jobs and keep the sector afloat.January is a vital month for the leisure industry, with many people renewing gym or pool memberships or committing to a new exercise programme. But with most sports banned for another six weeks – and possibly longer – ukactive, which represents more than 4,000 gyms and leisure facilities, said the industry was in deep trouble.“The government must protect this sector as a priority, before it becomes too late,” the ukactive chief executive, Huw Edwards, said. “January and February represent a vital period for gyms, pools, and leisure facilities to trade but they currently have zero income, unlike other sectors.”Last autumn the government announced a £100m fund across the sector while on Monday the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, revealed one-off grants of £9,000 for small businesses would also be made available. But ukactive says that help is nowhere near enough.“The top-up grants and funding announced by the Chancellor, while welcome, will be no more than a sticking plaster for the financial challenges being faced,” Edwards said. “Both public and private fitness and leisure operators will require additional, tailored financial and regulatory support for their recovery.”Meanwhile new research from 4Global, which provides data analysis to governments and sporting bodies, has found the November lockdown restrictions on the sports industry cost Britain £29m in terms of social value – a figured based on the sector’s contribution to the reduction, through exercise, of health conditions such as depression, diabetes and breast and colon cancer.This, said Edwards, showed the closure of gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools during January and February did not only present a “major threat to thousands of facilities and jobs, but also our nation’s health, and resilience to conditions including Covid-19, obesity and some cancers”.Edwards also pointed to evidence from the first lockdown in England, which showed anxiety levels doubled compared with the 2019 average – with an extra 3.2 million people classed as inactive, undertaking less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, as further evidence for more government support.The government has also been urged by the Youth Sports Trust to do more to help young people to stay active. Meanwhile the sports scientist Greg Whyte has told the  that Britain is heading for a “perfect storm” in which a reduction in activity levels during the winter lockdown has a disastrous effect on physical and mental health.Whyte has also called on the government to use the 400,000 people who work in the fitness sector but are on furlough to get the population more active."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f8bd824d90fdf0c62aea63205a6b5ebe1765bf9/0_0_7680_4608/master/7680.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b74a6439e16d17395285498ee89767fc","title":"cake decorating quizzes and remote lunches keeping staff connected in the remote work era","story":"We can’t meet for a chat by the coffee machine right now, so how are firms keeping spirits high? With creative and fun virtual activities, it seemsNurturing a sense of shared purpose with work colleagues is challenging in these days of remote work and video meetings. Gone are post-work pints, sandwich-queue chats, tasting your colleague’s “cake-off” creation, and anything else resembling physical proximity and connection to your team. But with a little ingenuity – and a tolerance for 2D socialising – it’s still possible to keep spirits high and have fun.From virtual magicians and online games to judging cakes purely on how delicious they look on Zoom, employees are finding new ways to bond with colleagues – remotely. Events such as quizzes and lunchtime yoga may even have become more popular now that people can log on from home rather than having to stay late at the office or endure a lunch-hour sweat.Jade Emmons, a London-based communications manager for Degreed, a US education technology company, spent part of Halloween in fancy dress, running around her home seeking random items of clothing and a pumpkin as part of a competitive scavenger hunt. That was one of several online games held during her company’s virtual party.Other companies have been equally imaginative. One media organisation replaced its summer party with a global rendition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which correspondents from around the world took on some of Shakespeare’s most popular roles.Meanwhile, at Kindred, a PR firm, winning the 2020 baking competition hinges on how well you can pipe icing rather than perfect the best rise, as in previous years. Each participant received a Betty Crocker cake mix, so the real challenge was the decoration. A Chris Whitty cake – very 2020 – dreamed up by associate director Beccie Stevenson, made it to the final round. “You can’t taste it so it’s all down to the aesthetic,” she says.Stevenson is also a fan of a monthly initiative called Change Maker that gets people to nominate a colleague of the month. Her last pick was Emma Parrish, who won in October for the effort she put into suggesting books, podcasts and music to celebrate Black History Month. “She tackled quite difficult conversations, head on,” says Stevenson. Each winner gets to virtually spin a wheel to win a prize, which ranges from an alarm clock to a pair of sheepskin slippers.Nick Winham, whose job is overseeing a programme to recruit and train the next generation of talent for the software provider ServiceNow, is one of the California-based company’s culture champions, helping to run initiatives to keep its dispersed workforce feeling connected. He says the shift to remote working has resulted in many more people taking part in events such as quizzes. “When we did them at the office, we’d only get 15 people at most,” he says. “Doing them virtually, we’re getting 40 to 50. Other colleagues join in with their families.” Virtual yoga and meditation sessions are also proving to be much more popular than the real-life versions ever were.For companies keen to introduce their own programmes, Winham’s tips include blocking off time during the working day for non-work sessions. His quizzes, for instance, are at 4pm on Thursdays, with a takeaway pizza prize for the winner. “It gets very competitive,” he says.A “step-up” challenge earlier this summer, where ServiceNow colleagues formed teams to record their daily step counts, proved popular thanks to a novel twist that saw two executive directors volunteer to do something different with their hair depending on how much money was raised during the week-long challenge. “That created engagement,” Winham says. “Step-up September” developed as a result, with teams from across Europe.Other activities encourage people to chat openly about the challenges of working from home, with some offering coping tips. “The main advice has been to take a break,” Winham says, adding that he went for a walk before talking to me.London-based LocalGlobe, which invests in startup tech companies, hosts virtual “lunch and learn sessions” with guests as erse as the founder of the small business supporter Funding Circle and a representative of the anti-poverty group Camden Giving. Emma Phillips, a partner at LocalGlobe, says she wants to do all she can to keep employees engaged and connected. “At the moment people are feeling more cut off and isolated than ever, and there is concern that once we’ve defeated Covid-19, we’ll have an even worse mental health pandemic on our hands.”Often the simplest ideas can help compensate for the lack of in-person interaction. Online channels dedicated to different interests, from cats to physical fitness, work well at Degreed, says Emmons, although she steers clear of the HIIT workout and body-building chat. “Our London office manager has a virtual running club that she’s tried to convince me to join, but I’ve managed to dodge it so far!”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances.

His mother, he said, used to pick “somebody else’s cotton” as a teenager.“The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,” he said. “Tonight, we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible.”The Democrats were propelled to victory in Senate runoff elections by Black voters, young voters and new arrivals to the rapidly ersifying state, a coalition just strong enough to topple a long-dominant GOP and take control of the US Senate.The coalition closely mirrored the one that handed Georgia’s electoral college votes to President-elect Joe Biden, the first Democrat to win the state since 1992. In defeating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, Democrats will have half the seats in the chamber, leaving Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris to serve as tie-breaker.The high-stakes runoffs drew hundreds of millions of dollars, media attention and a massive organizing effort. The result was a game of inches – both Republicans and Democrats largely held their voters from November, the survey showed, but Democrats did just slightly better in pushing their voters to the polls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55258a1823eb4a5cd1c1ac6c32dc6b9f20d00ec4/0_261_1533_920/master/1533.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a9e882c424079b35f34567581d4000c1","title":"key workers in the uk share your experiences of the second wave of coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear from key workers such as refuse collectors and bus drivers about their experience of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the UKThe number of new cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic on Tuesday, with 1 in 50 people in England infected with the virus last week.With the UK still firmly in the throes of the second wave of coronavirus, we’d like to hear from key workers such as refuse collectors, bus drivers and postal workers, about their experience during the current peak.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Record numbers are also in hospital with Covid-19, with a further 3,500 admitted in England on Monday.GPs have been given instructions to “stand down non-essential work” in order to focus on the delivery of the jabs, the Daily  reported. Lucy Watson, the chair of the Patients Association, told the newspaper: “For patients to be confident that the NHS remains open for business it would be helpful for there to be clear messages from NHS England about which healthcare activities are being stopped in primary care and which healthcare activities are being continued.”Boris Johnson received the overwhelming backing of MPs for the latest lockdown as the House of Commons was recalled from its Christmas break on Wednesday, with a 508-majority of MPs voting for the measures that could be in place until 31 March.He told the Commons: “After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in the arm makes a difference.”The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine – with the second jab taking place 12 weeks after the first – is easier to administer as it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, unlike the PfizerBioNTech jab that requires long-term storage at -70C.The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19 in the UK. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.Seven mass vaccination centres will open next week in London, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Surrey and Stevenage.There were claims GPs have delayed vaccination clinics repeatedly because the delivery of supplies has been inconsistent. Richard Vautrey, who chairs the British Medical Association’s GP committee, told the Times it was “crucial that practices are given greater certainty over delivery date, which then do not change, and as much notice as possible of any potential delays so they can effectively mitigate the impact of rescheduling patients last minute”.One Bristol medical centre reportedly had its first batch, due on 22 December, cancelled at the last minute. A vaccination site in Rochdale, told to expect more than 1,000 doses this weekend, was then told they would not arrive, the Times reported.The vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi, admitted the target of vaccinating about 14 million people in the highest priority groups by 15 February was “stretching”. Approximately 1.3 million people have already received either the PfizerBioNTech or OxfordAstraZeneca jab.According to a report in the Daily Mail, the effort to increase the speed of inoculations will result in the approval period needed for Covid vaccine batches being slashed from 20 days to four. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the body responsible for the checks, will also increase staffing in an attempt to accelerate the programme, the paper reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f233b221afecbac9473377a03ff9a84c87502308/0_132_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86d387084a01ce0db781157803639ae2","title":"minke whale trapped in nets in japan for two weeks","story":"Animal rights groups demand animal’s release but locals claim its size and strong currents are making it hard to freeAnimal rights campaigners have demanded the immediate release of a minke whale that has been trapped for more than two weeks in nets in Taiji, a town on Japan’s Pacific coast known for its annul dolphin cull.Japanese media reported that attempts were being made to free the four or five metre long whale but fishermen claimed its size and strong tidal currents were making it difficult to guide it into open water.Ren Yabuki – an animal rights activist who has been filming the whale with a drone every day since it became trapped on Christmas Eve – said fishermen had made only one brief attempt to release the animal, adding that its fate appeared to have been decided.“It is difficult to guide the whale out of the nets and they don’t want to remove the nets as that would disrupt fishing and allow a large number of fish to escape, so my feeling is that they are going to kill it,” said Yabuki, campaign director of the Life Investigation Agency.If they slaughter the whale, fishermen would be able to sell its meat after taking a DNA sample, Yabuki added. “Allowing the whale to starve to death would be the worst possible end to this, so the only other option would be to draw in the net and send ers into the sea to kill it with spears.”“We fear time is now running out for the whale who will be getting weaker by the day. Intentionally subjecting these leviathans to prolonged suffering is inhumane and unjustified. HSI is hoping the Japanese authorities will insist on the immediate release of the whale.”The Japanese fisheries agency told HSI that it had asked the prefectural government to release the whale if it was possible and safe to do so.“We gather the fishermen are claiming safety issues and concern over the tides but we fear the delays could cost the whale its life,” HSI said.Taiji has struggled to repair its international reputation since the 2009 Oscar-winning documentary The Cove showed hunters rounding up dolphins in the open sea and corralling them to the coastline in so-called drive hunts.Attractive specimens are spared and sold for large sums to aquariums and marine parks, while others are killed and their meat sold. The hunts attracted international condemnation, including from the former US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy.In a rare interview, fishermen told the  that the hunts were legal under Japanese law and provided a vital source of income for the town, located on a remote part of the Pacific coastline.Yabuki said failure to save it would further damage Taiji’s reputation. “The whole world knows what is happening,” he said. “Letting it die, or killing it, would ruin the town’s image.

Photograph: iStockTowards the end of 2020, the double-edged sword of Covid-19 and Brexit pierced the armour of both An Post and the Royal Mail. They saw unprecedented levels of demand and a lack of clarity on changes from what was then a still uncertain trade deal between the EU and UK.On December 31st, in that confused climate, I ordered some items from a retailer in England at a cost of £86.50 (€96). At the time of ordering, Royal Mail had suspended postal orders to Europe due to the uncertainty of any changes Brexit might bring so the only option available was a £15 courier. I went with it.On the morning of Tuesday, January 5th, a courier service sent me an email to say it was delivering my items. The email said import dutytax payment of €38 was due. There was €25.50 in VAT and another €14.50 for an “advanced paymenthandling charge”. When I asked the courier company to explain the latter charge more clearly, they did not get back to me. “We’ve had more questions in the early part of January than we have had in December which we hadn’t anticipated.”Davies believes there is a lack of education for customers regarding payments, particularly when it comes to the unfamiliar terms of Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) and Delivered At Place (DAP). With DDP, the buyer is responsible for just the unloading of goods while the seller takes responsibility for customs clearance, duties, taxes and everything else relating to the order. DAP, however, sees the buyer taking responsibility for customs, duties, taxes as well as unloading. “In hindsight, I recognise my mistake was not to identify those terms and start educating customers about them,” Davies says.While these new terms may not be familiar to the public, he says the consequences of the UK’s departure from the EU are more practical than financial for the Liverpool-based business.“Money always finds a way through. In the end, after a lot of worry about Brexit, I don’t think there’s been any negative impact. It’s not really a political or even economic situation, it’s more logistics.”That’s the view of one business in one part of England and that view will undoubtedly contrast with others in different parts of the UK. What is most striking, however, is the simple lack of certainty even after four years of headlines and bulletins dominated by the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum. When shopping online from a UK business, it would pay for Irish consumers to contact the business before check-out to see if it operates as DAP or DDP and if it is VAT registered in the State.It can only be hoped that things will become a little more straightforward sooner rather than later. For now, I’ll be sticking to my new year’s resolution of buying Irish unless there is absolutely no other option.Then there was Abdullahi. “Before Brexit, online shopping was very easy and deliveries arrive fast. Now I ordered a book three days ago and it says that it’s going to be delivered between the 18th and 20th of January. I also tried to order a stethoscope online and it said it cannot be delivered due to Brexit. It is very tough now.”PJ writes: “My wife bought a coat from ie.burberry on sale. There was no mention of taxes or custom charges. The charges were as follows – €100 taxes, approx €50 in custom duties, and €18 other for a €400 jacket. Refused to pay so UPS won’t release.” Ciarra ordered Charlotte Tilbury make-up on December 27 at a cost of €105. “I got a message from DHL this morning to say my package was on the way. Then I got a follow-up email to say that I had to pay €41.80, broken down, that was €14.50 advance payment?! And €27.30 VAT at import. The email said if I didn’t pay it, I wouldn’t get my package. I’m afraid to pay as I don’t know is it a scam or where they got their figures from, still no sign of the package, although it was due to be delivered today!”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe BloombergAffordable and cost rental housing will not be viable in Dublin unless the State subsidy for its construction is doubled, Dublin City Council’s head of housing has said.Brendan Kenny said a €50,000 grant towards the cost of providing discounted homes might be “fine for Leitrim” but would be entirely insufficient for Dublin. “We really should be looking at €100,000,” he said.Legislation for an affordable housing scheme, which will provide State-subsidised homes for sale to low- and middle-income workers, is finally expected to come before the Dáil this year.The Affordable Housing Bill would also put cost rental, where rents are based on the cost of financing, building and managing the apartments rather than market rates, on a statutory footing.A major component of the discounted costs of both the rental and purchase schemes comes from the “serviced sites fund” which subsidises up to €50,000 of the cost of each home through funding the site infrastructure.However, Mr Kenny said the council was urging the Department of Housing to substantially increase this fund for the capital.“We have been making it clear a national structure doesn’t suit Dublin. Having a site subsidy of €50,000 for the whole country, that might be fine say for Leitrim, and I’ve nothing against Leitrim, but having the same thing for Dublin city just doesn’t work,” he said.“In the Dublin city area with its costs, really we should be looking at €100,000 – that would make a huge difference to the affordable housing scheme and to cost rental.”Without the increase, the purchase price or the rents could not be reduced to an “affordable” level in Dublin city, Mr Kenny said.“We cannot build a unit in Dublin for €300,000, no way. The average cost is more than €400,000. The schemes we are building at the moment, the big ones in the city, the average costs are €430,000 per unit,” he said.“That doesn’t mean we don’t build. What it mean is if you are going to do affordable housing or cost rental, the Government needs to come up with a much bigger site subsidy than anywhere else in the country.”However, it subsequently emerged this related to the construction of just 45 homes, half of which were not new build homes, but were the housing the council had refurbished at Priory Hall, which cost the council just under €141,000 to redevelop.Mr O’Brien in December issued new figures indicating the average cost of homes approved for construction on city council lands in the past two years was just under €384,000.The State’s last affordable housing scheme was discontinued in 2011. A new scheme was announced five years ago in Budget 2016 but was never enacted. The last government re-announced the measure in 2018. Legislation was drafted and 18 months ago local authorities approved the “scheme of priority”, which determined how prospective buyers would be chosen. However, the legislation was never enacted.In October, speaking at a post-budget briefing, Mr O’Brien said the legislation would come before the Dáil within weeks.In the days before Christmas Mr O’Brien said the affordable purchase scheme, “will be finalised in the coming months”.

Only Ireland, Italy, and the United States shut down construction during earlier lockdowns, according to the Construction Industry Federation. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsAll but essential construction work will shut down from Friday evening as part of the national effort to stop the spread of coronavirus.Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien, said the shutdown was “necessary” as part of wider measures aimed at halting the current trajectory of the virus.Some 7,836 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Wednesday, the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.A very limited number of essential sites and a small number of designated social housing projects due to be completed within eight weeks will be allowed to continue. The Cabinet also agreed that construction and work relating to the day-to-day operation of water, wastewater, and gas infrastructure remain essential.Outbreaks relating to the industry represent 0.6 per cent of all coronavirus clusters since August.A spokeswoman for Mr O’Brien said around 1,400 social housing units would be completed by the end of next month but the restrictions would “of course” have a negative impact on social housing targets.Under the new restrictions announced on Wednesday, construction will be closed with effect from 6pm on Friday next January 8th except for the construction or development of:- essential health and related projects including those relevant to preventing, limiting, minimising or slowing the spread of Covid-19- A limited number of social housing projects, including voids, designated as essential sites by local authorities based on set criteria (projects due to be completed in the next six to eight weeks)- housing adaptation grants where the homeowner is agreeable to adaptions being undertaken in their home- repair, maintenance and construction of critical transport and utility infrastructure- education facilities sites designated as essential by Department of Education- supply and delivery of essential or emergency maintenance and repair services to businesses and places of residence (including electrical, gas, plumbing, glazing and roofing services) on an emergency call-out basis- certain large construction projects in the exportingFDI sector based on set criteria.In relation to private homes that are practically complete and scheduled for habitation by 31 January 2021, including where snagging, and essential remediation work, such as pyrite works is nearing completion, works should continue to enable homeowners access their homes.Heating, water, broadband and electricity installation should also continue to enable homes be occupied.Existing tenancy protections mean that a tenant cannot be evicted from their home during the period of the 5km travel restrictions.The Minister acknowledged that closing most construction sites will have an impact on 2021 housing delivery targets, but he said his department will do “whatever is necessary to make up as much ground as possible as restrictions ease”.He said the health and safety of 200,000 people working directly and indirectly in construction is the top priority.Only Ireland, Italy, and the United States shut down construction during earlier lockdowns, according to the Construction Industry Federation. Tom Parlon, its director general, said it will take months to calculate the impact the decision to shut down work sites will have on the industry.“The previous lockdown may have resulted in 5,000 fewer homes than expected in 2020,” he said in a statement.Mr Parlon said the industry has had an “excellent track record” at keeping Covid-19 off sites and managing it on sites. He said there was never a point over the last nine months where a site recorded more than 56 cases. The rate of infection among construction workers has been considerably lower than in the general population, he added.The organisation is advocating for the sector to reopen on January 31st.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451749.1609975698!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"credibility of government on the line over covid 19 surge and slow vaccinations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParamedics and ambulances at the Mater hospital in Dublin as public health chiefs released the latest daily number of new Covid-19 cases – just shy of 8,000. Photograph:   Brian LawlessPA Watched by a wearied and fearful country, the Government slumped into the third national lockdown on Wednesday, warning that the third wave of the pandemic now threatens to overwhelm the health service as numbers of infections climb to previously unimaginable heights.Barely an hour after the Taoiseach and his fellow Coalition leaders announced the new lockdown measures, public health chiefs released the latest daily number of new cases – just shy of 8,000. Unless these numbers begin to abate soon, they will crash through even the surge capacity in the health service that will surely be called into operation in the coming days. The leaders of the Government now fear that the health service will simply be unable to deal with the number of cases seeking admission to hospital wards and to intensive care units in the coming days and weeks.The important numbers over the coming days are not so much the case numbers, says one senior figure, it is the hospital numbers and the intensive care unit numbers. The nightmare scenario of last March is back: the wolf is at the door.The lockdown is – for everyone with the exception of the Leaving Cert students – as stringent as last March. Few sources who spoke privately on Wednesday night expected it to finish in three weeks. Social problemsAll the social problems that are exacerbated by these conditions – educational disadvantage, domestic violence, economic damage, and the rest of that grim procession – will return. Ireland is not alone for sure, but it is a hell of a price to pay for a meaningful Christmas. The truth is that the price is vastly more than anyone envisaged.The search for someone to blame is understandable, and will continue, even if there are more pressing matters for everyone to deal with right now. Internally within the Government, there is a cacophony of finger-pointing and dissent. But ultimately the Government as a whole makes the decisions and ultimately it is accountable for them. But such judgments will be more wisely made in the fullness of time, allowing for their consequences to play out, for better or for worse.However the blame game goes, the future of the Government’s authority – and therefore its ability to enforce its will, on Covid and other matters – rests on two issues. One is within its own control, the other is not.Fate of the country’s hospitalsThe first is the fate of the country’s hospitals over the coming fortnight. If the hospitals are overrun it will be a hammer blow to the Government’s authority and credibility. The claim the Coalition could reasonably make before Christmas – when it had the lowest infection rate and limited excess deaths – that it had managed the crisis well would no longer be tenable. The second issue is more – though not entirely – within the Government’s control. The roll-out of the vaccine has been slow to start. Unless it accelerates, the Government will look woefully inadequate, especially as vaccinations continue at an apparently rapid pace in the UK and elsewhere. Teething problems are understandable and there are constraints on supply. But if the Government is not vaccinating as quickly as it is receiving supplies very soon – and is able to demonstrate that it is – people will draw their own conclusions about its competence and credibility.

Image: CNN Screengrab.Irish journalist Donie O’Sullivan said he was “overwhelmed by all the love from Ireland” on Wednesday night after he starred in US network CNN’s coverage of the siege at the Capitol in Washington. The Co Kerry native was praised on social media for his reporting from the scene as supporters of outgoing president Donald Trump stormed the building.He calmly relayed news back to the studio as hosts including veteran Wolf Blitzer urged him to “stay safe” amid the unrest and hostility towards journalists at the scene. O’Sullivan at one point reported that he had heard one of those present saying ‘next time we’re coming back with rifles’. His exploits saw ‘Donie’ trending on Twitter in Ireland. Comedian Dara Ó Briain was amongst those who congratulated the reporter, saying “CNN just introduced a reporter called Donie O’Sullivan and fair dues, he sounds exactly like you’d hope”. John King, CNN’s chief national correspondent, described Mr O’Sullivan as “awesome”. Screenwriter Declan Lawn said of O’Sullivan: “All the other CNN correspondents can’t believe this stuff and are freaking out but Donie O’Sullivan is strolling around like he’s seen far worse coming out of a Carlow nightclub.”Responding to the outpouring on social media, O’Sullivan said on Twitter that he was “overwhelmed by all the love from Ireland tonight”. O’Sullivan has been working as a reporter with CNN for almost five years and prior to this spent over two years working as a journalist for Storyful in New York and Dublin.He has an undergraduate degree in history, politics and international relations from University College Dublin (UCD) and a masters degree in political science and government from Queen’s University Belfast.

There was 911, the financial crisis and now Covid, ordeals that shook us to our core, with political, economic and cultural repercussions that will last for decades. Each time, we have been exposed as spoilt, emotional and weak – utterly unprepared, psychologically and practically, to cope with such seemingly low-probability, high-impact events. When these sorts of “tail risks”, as statisticians call them, do materialise, we are immediately traumatised: panic sets in as our certainties and assumptions are shattered, and our entire way of life, our freedoms, our prosperity, our health, our self-satisfied sense of superiority are exposed as staggeringly fragile. It turns out that modern life is only possible (or, to many, desirable) if nothing goes wrong in any significant way, and yet there tends to be a major emergency every seven or so years – and three since the end of the Cold War. For a civilisation that sees itself as the most advanced, the most rationalistic ever, and that is obsessed with comparing itself with the unenlightened, backward mores of the past, our proximity to the abyss is not just a humiliating but also a terrifying realisation. Even worse, these events are all, in fact, known unknowns: all have happened many times before, and all will happen many times again. We are not talking about genuine unpredictability, real Black Swans. So why didn’t we see them coming? Why didn’t we prepare properly against the menace of evil terrorists, or viruses, or the economic cycle? Take the coronavirus. It is now clear that this latest variant is spiralling out of control, that deaths are shooting up again and that the NHS is in danger of running out of capacity in some areas once more. The prognosis is much grimmer than it was a few weeks ago: the total number of excess deaths in the UK may now end up breaching 100,000. By some calculations, we have already surpassed the death toll of the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69, which killed 80,000, and that of the Asian flu of 1957-58, which claimed 33,000, in both cases without lockdowns.The reality is that we are going to pull through this pandemic, by the skin of our teeth, despite mass deaths and extreme economic and social damage. The astonishingly speedy discovery of effective and safe vaccines – a scientific miracle – has changed everything, and the Government must now vaccinate 247 and reopen society as soon as the vulnerable are inoculated. But we can’t go through this again and again, being caught out every time and relying on luck and hideous, calamitous lockdowns to bail us out. The costs – in terms of lives, of course, but also in this case in foregone liberties as a result of lockdowns, in massive welfarism, ruined education, huge debt, economic torture, cultural damage and in destroyed families, communities and traditions are far too high. We would have suffered much less had we prepared. What will happen if the next pandemic is much more lethal, or if it kills children rather than the elderly? What if a cyberattack takes out communications and electricity in a major Western capital city, and food and water supplies run out? Or when the great quantitative easing experiment finally implodes? At some point, a rogue nation will detonate a nuclear weapon, or assassinate a world leader, Franz Ferdinand style, or there will be a far more significant accident than Fukushima. How could our decadent societies handle any of this? Simply seeking to muddle through, as we did with the virus, would guarantee Armageddon. Our inability to realise that we haven’t opted out of history, despite Twitter, robotics, AI and the rest, is one of our greatest blind spots. Our society is not robust, it isn’t “normal” (in a historic, global sense) and it won’t necessarily be eternal unless we try a lot harder to make it so. Liberalism, conservatism, capitalism: all could easily be swept away when the next really big crisis hits us.Marx was wrong about everything: the real opium of the people in a modern, developed society is simply a belief that the good days will always continue, and that the future is automatically going to be a similar but better version of the present. The public’s support for the status quo ends very quickly if it starts to believe that life is about to get worse.Most of the time, a belief in progress makes sense: rational optimism, to use the great Matt Ridley’s phraseology, is a sensible philosophy based on a sound appreciation of the wonders of capitalism and technology. Contrary to the usual whining, the world has been getting richer and cleaner for years, people are living longer and poverty has collapsed. But the fact that the international capitalist order delivers the goods also needs to be tempered by realism: the system works well overall ordinarily, but it can easily be derailed by shocks such as wars, terrorism or pandemics. These need to be better understood and managed: the role of states isn’t to rule people’s lives, tell them what to eat, spend 45 per cent of GDP or own every hospital. It is simply to prevent the system from collapsing (and, of course, to refrain from collapsing it out of malice or incompetence à la Iran or Russia, or Venezuela-style economics). Yet they keep failing that basic task, and inevitably make matters worse.It is time, therefore, for the West to become a lot more “anti-fragile”, as the philosopher and statistician Nassim Taleb puts it. Governments must focus on the modern-day equivalent of nuclear fallout shelters: we need a whole series of highly developed, well-rehearsed plan Bs with mass public buy-in. A minister for resilience should be appointed. New institutions must be developed. Our foreign policy must become far more robust towards lawless states. We need to spend much more on cybersecurity, pandemic prevention, defence and space technology. I used to be an optimist: no longer.

That depends on measures taken to limit its spread.French schools all opened on Monday and the country has a curfew in place but no blanket lockdown like in the UK.Fears of the new variant came as major logistical failings were on Wednesday blamed on France’s slow start to vaccinations. President Emmanuel Macron has come in for intense personal criticism after it transpired that France had only administered a paltry 516 jabs in the first week.Doctors injected 5,000 people on Monday and pledged to catch up with neighbours “within days”.Gérard Larcher, president of the French Senate from the Right-wing opposition party, The Republicans, slammed the government for a “lack of preparedness” and “totally defective logistics”.The government, he said, had “made a choice that is totally ill-suited to the types of vaccines available today” by not opting to vaccinate people en masse in single locations.“There is no response other than collective vaccination due to the conditions for conserving” the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, which must be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius.The government initially ruled out large-scale vaccinations in single locations.Mr Larcher called for a “a logistician” to be put in charge of rolling out the vaccine and for red tape to be slashed.The criticism came as the French government confirmed reports that it had commissioned in December private consultancy McKinsey to help it with its “vaccine strategy”.It said the government had the last word but opposition politicians called the move “alarming”.France registered around 20,500 new cases on Tuesday compared to 61,000 in the UK and posted an R number of 0.91 compared to 1.1 to 1.3 in the UK.The country posted 7,583 new hospital admissions over the past week compared to 17,175 admissions in a week in the UK.The death toll in France on Tuesday since the pandemic struck was 66,282 compared to 76,305 in the UK.Only 40 per cent of French say they are currently willing to be vaccinated compared to almost 80 per cent in the UK, the latest polls suggest.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day epiphany carnival blonde hedgehog","story":"A rare blonde hedgehog rescued after being found wandering around Heddington, Wiltshire has been nicknamed Boris for his bright locks.

She was part of a crowd that was breaking down the doors to a barricaded room where armed officers stood on the other side.City police said three other people died from medical emergencies during the long protest on and around the Capitol grounds.Congressmen who had gathered in the Senate and the House of Representatives to certify the election results were forced to flee under escort as law enforcement lost control of the situation.In the House chamber, security officers pulled their guns and barricaded the door.At least one pro-Trump protester entered the Senate chamber, sitting with his hand aloft in victory. As evening approached, a 6pm citywide curfew was announced. The events were widely described as a dark day for American democracy.Senators were told to go back to the voting chamber on Wednesday night to complete the voting process to confirm Mr Biden\u0027s victory after it had been cleared. Mr Trump had addressed the crowds hours before they marched on the Capitol, telling them to “stop the steal” and doubling down on his false claims of election victory.Mr Biden, the president-elect, said US democracy was under “unprecedented assault”. “I call on President Trump to go on national TV and demand an end to this siege,” he said.“This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition. And it must end now. I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward.”After violence broke out, Mr Trump called for calm, writing on Twitter: “I am asking for everyone at the US Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence!”Mr Trump later released a video telling his supporters to go home. He said: “You have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt.”But he continued to maintain a landslide election had been fraudulently stolen from him. He told the protesters: We love you. You\u0027re very special. I know how you feel.Mr Trump told them to go home with peace and love and remember this day forever!Twitter removed two of his Twitter posts for violating its rules, as social media companies scrambled to address the messages being spread on their platforms. Later, Twitter locked Mr Trump out of his account for 12 hours after he repeatedly violated their policy in relation to the violent clashes in Capitol Hill, revoking his special protection as an elected official. Read more: Can the 25th amendment be invoked to remove Trump from office?Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, wrote on Twitter: “Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.”Former president George W. Bush on Wednesday denounced some of his fellow Republicans for fuelling the insurrection.This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic, he said.Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, tweeted urging the extremists be taken to task. Let us swiftly bring justice to the criminals who engaged in this rioting, he tweeted. The remarkable developments in the nation’s capital were not inevitable when the sun rose on Wednesday morning, though there was a sense of foreboding around the city.Thousands of the president’s faithful had gathered the night before, arriving after Mr Trump demanded support for his ongoing claim that he, not Mr Biden, was the real election victor. It was the day when Congress was due to perform its largely ceremonial duty of signing off the results ahead of the inauguration on Jan 20, when Mr Biden becomes president.But the day had double significance. The final balance of the Senate, a chamber in which the Republicans have held the majority for six years, swung in favour of the Democrats.Georgia, a deeply conservative and deeply religious state which has been a stronghold of the Republican Party for decades, voted on Tuesday for its two US senators.The races had gone to a so-called run-off after no candidate got more than 50 per cent in the November election. But it carried more significance than just that. The Democrats were on 48 Senate seats and the Republicans on 50 before the run-offs.If the Democrats won both, they would finally have control of the Senate because the vice-president – soon to be Kamala Harris, Mr Biden’s running mate – casts the deciding vote in ties. On Wednesday morning it was clear the Democrats were heading for just that.The Rev Raphael Warnock was declared the winner in his race against Kelly Loeffler, the Republican. The result made Mr Warnock only the 11th black senator elected in US history and the first to represent the state of Georgia.The second race, between Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old documentary film-maker, and David Perdue, the sitting republican senator, was closer. But by the afternoon the race had been called for Mr Ossoff. The Democrats had flipped both seats – a remarkable feat.Democrats were celebrating their expected victories and working out just how beneficial it would be for Mr Biden’s presidency.For one, he will no longer need to rely on Republican votes to confirm any of his proposed cabinet members – some of whom had been controversial – or judicial appointments, not least a Supreme Court pick should a seat become free in his term. For another, passing his legislative agenda will be easier. While bold progressive reforms like expanding government-funded healthcare and major climate change action may be hard to keep the Democrats united on, others such as getting more stimulus money to help those affected by the pandemic should pass.Plus it will mean the Democrats, not the Republicans, will hold the gavels on Senate committees, and with it the power over what and who to investigate. That could help Mr Biden in his first two years in office.The jubilation on the Democratic side was matched by the frustration on the Republican side. Georgia was now a blue state, won by Mr Biden at the election and with two Democratic senators. Much of the blame was heading towards Mr Trump, who had gone to political war with senior Republicans in Georgia over their refusal to overturn Mr Biden’s win and disheartened supporters with claims of election rigging.Josh Holmes, the former chief of staff to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, was among those to point the finger at the president. The president, however, reached for a familiar explanation – vote rigging. Just like in the wake of his presidential election defeat, Mr Trump began to make unfounded and wild allegations of election fraud on Twitter.By midmorning attention was focusing on downtown Washington DC.Tens of thousands of pro-Trump protesters had been gathering outside the White House. Their presence in the capital was not just welcomed by Mr Trump but actively encouraged. For weeks, the president has been turning his attention to Congress’s role in approving the presidential election results.Since the election the courts and the states have consistently rejected the president’s claim that he won a “landslide” only to have it somehow “stolen”. Now Congress was Mr Trump’s last remaining hope. Gary Dalbec had travelled seven hours from Charleston, South Carolina to attend the march. He said he hoped the protest would help to “expose the fraudulent election” and give Mr Trump another term in office.“It was fraud. They’ve got the evidence, they’re hiding it. We just need the right people to expose it. “The rest of the people are committing treason,” he added. “Today is make or break.”Susan Cardin, from Colorado, said she had been protesting outside the White House since 5am. “We’re here to save America. We’re here to stop the steal,” she said.When the president eventually spoke he unleashed a furious verbal attack on Republican congressmen who had refused to endorse his baseless claims of victory. “They’re weak Republicans. They’re pathetic Republicans,” he said at one point.His defiance of election defeat was total: “We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.”Mr Trump also repeatedly demanded that Mike Pence, who as vice-president oversees the Senate procedures, somehow intervene to reject the confirmation of the election results.“Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country,” he said. “And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you.”The crowd cheered. And yet just as Mr Trump was uttering his demands, Mr Pence was doing the opposite – releasing a letter sent to congressmen explaining why he would not be following the president’s advice.It argued that he had no power to “unilaterally” throw out the decision of the people, insisting such a move would be unconstitutional.It was a remarkable moment in the Trump presidency, the point when Mr Pence publicly broke with Mr Trump. But he was not alone. Shortly afterwards, once Mr Pence stepped into the chair to oversee the Senate debate that would confirm the results, Mr McConnell rose. He too was about to break with the president. He said the vote was the most important he had taken in his 36 years in the US Senate.“President Trump claims the election was stolen. Nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election.” He added: “Voters, courts, the states have all spoken. They’ve all spoken. If we overrule them it would damage our republic forever. “If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side then our democracy would enter a death spiral.”There were rebels, however. Thirteen Republican senators or senators-elect had made public their desire to object to the results beforehand.In the event it was Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who came close to winning the 2016 Republican nomination and is expected to try again in 2024, who led the charge.He said large numbers of Americans believed the election was “rigged” and polls showed that included 17 per cent of Democrats. Mr Cruz said “simply telling the voters go jump in a lake” would “jeopardise the legitimacy of this and subsequent elections”.Mr Cruz said: “I am not arguing for setting aside the result of the election.”Instead, he wanted Congress to appoint an impartial electoral commission to hold an emergency 10-day audit and resolve the claims.The move was doomed to defeat. Even before the session had started it was clear the vast majority of US senators were willing and ready to confirm Mr Biden’s victory.But then the crowds descended. Sent on their way by Mr Trump to march up Capitol Hill from the White House, his vocal army of supporters reached the Capitol building. The first protesters reached the inside at 2pm.Lawmakers were told to duck under their seats for cover and put on gas masks after tear gas was used in the Capitol Rotunda. Some House lawmakers tweeted they were sheltering in place in their offices.Democratic Congressman Scott Peters told reporters he was in the House chamber when rioters began storming it. Security officers made us all get down, you could see that they were fending off some sort of assault, it looked like.They had a piece of furniture up against the door, the door, the entry to the floor from the Rotunda, and they had guns pulled, Peters said.And they just told us to take our pins off, he added, referring to lapel pins members wear so Capitol Police can quickly identify them. Then the lawmakers were evacuated.Staff members grabbed the boxes of Electoral College votes as the evacuation took place. Otherwise, said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the ballots likely would have been destroyed by the protesters.Trump supporters posting on internet forums popular with far-right fringe elements celebrated the chaos. Messages posted on one turned from profane frustration over the content of Trump\u0027s speech to glee when supporters stormed the building. At least one leading figure was livestreaming video from inside the Capitol during the siege.The entire District of Columbia National Guard, made up of 1,100 troops, was ordered into the city at the request of Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser.Footage showed that one protester reached the office of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, and left a note reading “we will not back down”.Both Ms Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, released a statement calling on Mr Trump to demand that all protesters leave the US Capitol. The democratic system had ground to a halt.Pro-Trump demonstrators assembled elsewhere in the country, forcing evacuations in at least two states. Cheers rang out in St. Paul, Minnesota, from demonstrators in reaction to the news that supporters of Mr Trump had stormed the Capitol. New Mexico state police evacuated staff from a statehouse building as a precaution after hundreds of flag-waving supporters arrived in a vehicle caravan and on horseback.The Pentagon said about 1,100 District of Columbia National Guard members were being mobilised to help support law enforcement at the Capitol. More than a dozen people were arrested.As darkness began to set in, law enforcement officials worked their way toward the protesters, using percussion grenades to try to clear the area around the Capitol. Big clouds of tear gas were visible. Police in full riot gear moved down the steps, clashing with demonstrators.As the Senate reconvened to complete the voting process to confirm Mr Biden\u0027s victory, Mr Pence condemned the violent supporters of Mr Trump.You did not win. Violence never wins, Mr Pence said of the gang of people who responded to Mr Trump\u0027s call to protest his loss in November\u0027s presidential election.Mr Pence said the Capitol was secured, and urged the Senate to get back to work. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the failed insurrection underscored lawmakers\u0027 duty to confirm the vote. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress would show the world what America is made of by finishing the count.Punctuating their resolve, both the House and Senate soundly defeated the first objection, to election results from Arizona that had been raised by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. Still, most House Republicans had voted for it. Proceedings pushed into the night.On Wednesday night, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, asked that people “pray for the USA”. He wrote in a tweet: “For the moment let us pray for the USA, the world’s greatest defender of democracy until now, as it faces this huge shock. May God bless America with peace and reconciliation.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"democracy fractured worlds newspapers reacted capitol storming","story":"The world\u0027s media reacted with shock as supporters of Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday, with the shameful scenes splashed across the front pages. As leaders lined up to condemn the chaos unfolding in a country they once relied upon for global leadership, international headlines lamented over the attack on democracy. With drawn guns and tear gas, police evacuated lawmakers and struggled for more than three hours to clear the Capitol Building of Trump supporters, who surged through the halls and rummaged through offices in shocking scenes of chaos and mayhem.One protester occupied the Senate dais and yelled: Trump won that election. Protesters overturned barricades and clashed with police as thousands descended on the Capitol grounds.Here\u0027s how the world\u0027s newspapers reacted.In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the events in the US Congress a disgrace, saying the United States stood for democracy around the world and that was it was vital now that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.The violence replaced the coronavirus lockdown on most of the country\u0027s front pages. Democracy under siege, The Daily  said on its front page.  Italians watched the events with shock, having always considered the US to be the model of democracy and the country that rescued Italy after its fascist descent during World War II.This is the widely anticipated outcome of Trumpism, tweeted a retired Italian center-left politician, Pierluigi Castagnetti. And unfortunately it won\u0027t end today. When politics is replaced by deception and fanaticism of the people the drift is inevitable.European Parliament President David Sassoli, who leads one of the largest legislatures in the world, also denounced the scenes at the Capitol. The European Union has spent four cantankerous years dealing with the Trump administration, and its top officials have repeatedly said they are looking forward to a better relationship under President-elect Joe Biden.This is insurrection. Nothing less. In Washington, tweeted Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden.In France, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Twitter: The violence against the American institutions is a grave attack on democracy. I condemn it. The will and the vote of the American people must be respected.Le Figaro newspaper described it as fractured democracy. Libération newspaper ran with the headline Trump\u0027s strategy of chaos.In Germany, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said democracy\u0027s enemies would be cheered by scenes of violence at the United States Capitol, and he called on Trump to accept US voters\u0027 decision.In a tweet, Maas said the violence had been caused by inflammatory rhetoric. Trump and his supporters must accept the decision of American voters at last and stop trampling on democracy.Its newspaper Morgen Post used just one word to describe the events: Shame!In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a tweet: I am following with concern the news that are coming from Capitol Hill in Washington. I trust in the strength of America\u0027s democracy.The new Presidency of @JoeBiden will overcome this time of tension, uniting the American people.El Pais placed the blame solely at Trump\u0027s feet, saying he instigated the revolt.In Ireland, foreign minister Simon Coveney called the scenes in Washington a deliberate assault on Democracy by a sitting President \u0026amp his supporters, attempting to overturn a free \u0026amp fair election!

The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news covid test holidays flights uk restrictions ban","story":"A beach in Lanzarote, Canary Isles, displays its coronavirus rulesWhat a new national lockdown means for travelCan I go on holiday?New UK entry testing rules: Everything you need to knowWill cruise holidays make a comeback in 2021?Sign up to the  Travel newsletter​Travel agents are warning of rising holiday prices and an impending shortage of summer availability – caused by pent-up demand for future trips, and the many postponed bookings from last year.We’ve already seen an increase in bookings for this summer with Greece and Turkey currently being the most popular choices for customers, followed by the Balearic and Canary Islands, a TUI spokesperson told  Travel. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook reported an immediate jump in holiday bookings as soon as people finished work for Christmas.The UK\u0027s domestic travel industry has warned of limited availability this year. The pent-up demand for Easter through to 2022 is really high, said Alistair Handyside, Executive Chair of The Professional Association of Self-Caterers UK.Anyone who has not booked a holiday in the UK soon will be looking at the leftovers.Package holiday prices are largely driven by the cost of flights, says Craig Ashford, Director of Marketing at travel agency TravelUp – and as demand rises, so too will holiday prices, he warns. Airlines are trying to stimulate the market so there are some phenomenally low rates. As confidence returns the total number of airline seats will remain the same, so the cost will rise. My strong advice is to book now.Scroll down for more on this story, and other breaking news. Heathrow Airporthas reminded the public that \u0027only passengers undertaking essential travel may enter\u0027 its terminal buildings.That includes those who are travelling for essential reasons under the current lockdown legislation – as well as those offering care or assistance to travellers.Face coverings are also mandatory in terminal buildings, for all people over the age of 11. If you\u0027re thinking of booking a trip for later this year, take advantage of low flight prices while you still can, warns a spokesperson from travel agency Travelup: My strong advice is to book now, especially if you have a particular dream holiday or trip in mind. The prices can only go up. Once we are out of lockdown, the vaccine programme is rolled out more widely, and more travel corridors are opened up with testing, capacity is going to disappear pretty quickly. There is no point waiting to book nearer to departure time nowadays. Years ago there were low cost carriers, charters and scheduled airlines – and they were using different price matrixes. The low cost carriers would start off cheap and then get more expensive as you got closer to the departure date. The other airlines would reduce their prices to fill the empty seats. Now they all use the same model: they get more expensive. They all work on the basis that it’s the people who really need to travel who are booking so close to departure. So there is no point waiting any more.The boss of Norwegian Air has said the airline is \u0027fighting for survival\u0027 amid the coronavirus travel ban – with traffic down 94 per cent year-on-year. CEO  Jacob Schram said that just 130,000 passengers travelled on the airline in December 2020 – just 6 per cent of the passenger numbers in December 2019. The pandemic continues to have a negative impact on our business as it has had since March 2020, said Schram.At the beginning of last year, Norwegian was headed for a positive result in 2020 instead 2020, has been a very challenging year and we now find ourselves fighting for survival.The politan Police has said that officers will now be more inquisitive of people\u0027s behaviour and be quicker to act to engage rulebreakers. Police forces around the country would take similar approaches, Scotland Yard said.Over the past few weeks, officers have already turned long-distance day trippers away from beauty spots around the UK – including Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons. Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said that police resources were not limitless and officers continued to prioritise their work, adding that it was really, really important that people followed the Government guidance.Canada will end its ban on flights from the UK on Wednesday, Transport Minister Marc Garneau has announced.The ban on UK flights, which was going until midnight tonight will lapse.

Angry backbenchers expressed alarm over new laws, after the small print revealed the lockdown could stay in place until March. MPs backed the plan in a Commons vote on Wednesday by  votes to , providing the Prime Minister with a majority of . But  Tory and  DUP MPs opposed the legislation. While the scale of the Tory revolt was smaller than the  MPs who opposed the tougher tier rules in December, it is a sign of trouble ahead for the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson insisted he had no choice but to impose a third national lockdown as the UKaposs death toll soared to levels seen during the peak of the pandemic in April. He told MPs earlier that the March deadline was not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis. The PM added: Our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will not be a big bang but a gradual unwrapping. On Wednesday, , people had died within  days of testing positive for Covid- - the highest daily reported total since April . Official figures are being affected by a lag of reporting over the festive period, with a round a third of the new deaths taking place before January  and around  in the week before Christmas Day. Record numbers of Covid- patients are in Englandaposs hospitals, with , people on the wards as of am on January . The figure is up % on a week ago. A string of Tory rebels expressed anger at new restrictions - despite the spiralling infection rates.  Former minister Sir Desmond Swayne branded lockdowns a complete failure while Sir Robert Syms said the measures, which are in place until March , were essentially a blank cheque for three months to Public Health England to do what they wish. Senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker blasted privileged people who were finding it easy to follow the rules. I canapost support criminalising a parent for seeing a child in the park over the coming months, itaposs not within my DNA to do that, he said. Sir Charles said it was easy for him and most people in this House to comply with the law, explaining: Weaposre comfortably off, we live in nice houses, we have gardens, we have outdoor spaces, we have access to family. The same applies to those journalists who fill our TV screens every night with their wisdom and wit about how people should comply with these regulations, and how they sneer at those who canapost.  How MPs voted on the lockdownThe new law, known as the Health Protection Coronavirus, RestrictionsandRegulations , passed by  votes to , with a majority of .  Conservative MPs,  Labour,  Liberal Democrats voted in favour, along with Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia Webbe.No vote was recorded for  MPs, although this does not automatically mean they abstained.

The drive to mass vaccinate the population will gather pace with the jab available at  GP-led services from Thursday, NHS England said. It comes as the UK faces a race to protect the population after the daily reported death toll topped , for the first time since April.Record numbers are also currently in hospital with coronavirus, with a further , admitted in England on Monday January .Boris Johnson, who was given the overwhelming backing of MPs for the latest lockdown, warned that there was now a race between the spread of the virus and the delivery of vaccines to the most vulnerable. Meanwhile, the Dailyreports that family doctors have been instructedto “stand down” routine care and prioritise Covid vaccinations, so the NHS can meet its target of  million jabs by next month.GPs have reportedly been issued guidance telling them that delivering the vaccine should be their “top priority”, with advice to “postpone other activities”. After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them, the Prime Minister told MPs yesterday as Parliament approved the new lockdown that could last until April. Every needle in every arm makes a dference. It is hoped that more than  sites will be delivering vaccines by the end of the week, with the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine easier to administer given it can be stored at fridge temperatures, unlike the Pfizer jab which requires storage at minus C.  Seven mass vaccination centres will open next week in London, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Surrey and Stevenage. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi admitted the target of vaccinating around  million people in the highest priority groups - including the elderly, those with clinical needs, care home residents and staff as well as frontline NHS workers - by February  was stretching. Some . million people have already received either the Pfizer BioNTech or Oxford AstraZeneca jab. According to a report in the Daily Mail, the bid to increase the speed of inoculations will see the approval period needed for Covid vaccine batches slashed from  days to just four. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency , the body responsible for the checks, is also set to increase staffing in a bid to accelerate the programme, the paper reported.  Ministers have already decided, in a move queried by the World Health Organisation , to administer the first jab to as many priority patients as possible by delaying a second shot. The second jab will be given  weeks later to prevent current supplies from being held back. In the clinical trials, vaccine recipients received a follow-up shot within three weeks. Mr Johnson was given approval for the latest lockdown in the Commons but faced rebellion within his ranks, with  Conservative MPs voting against the stay-at-home rules. They were joined by four DUP MPs opposing the regulations. In the face of pressure from senior Tories to commit to easing the restrictions - which came into force on Wednesday and were being voted on retrospectively by MPs - as soon as possible, Mr Johnson said there would be substantial opportunities for relaxation before March.  Mark Harper, ex-government chief whip and chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said the restrictions should be reviewed in the middle of February once the most vulnerable had been vaccinated, as per the Governmentaposs aim. The result came as Government data confirmed that the Covid death toll had once again reached levels not seen since the peak of the first wave in . The figures, however, continue to be affected by a lag in the publication of recent data and contain some deaths that took place over the Christmas and New Year period that have only just been reported.

But since last March I have looked after wards where all the patients have Covid- for months on end. Iaposve never seen anything like it. Total UK Covid deaths hit , this week but many more infected people end up in hospital, get sick in care homes or have a rough few weeks at home. On call for emergency admissions, as I was this week, around half the patients I admit are sick due to Covid. Right now, a quarter of our beds are filled by Covid patients and our Intensive Care Units and High Dependency Units, have nearly doubled in size to cope with the surge in demand. The current peak is already as high as it was in April and the models suggest it will worsen through January. I have never seen so many patients needing so much oxygen for so long and while I’m very used to looking after seriously ill and dying patients, the sheer number has been relentless. One morning in April I saw five die within around  minutes. Hearing some people say it is “just a cold” or “just like a normal flu season” beggars belief for NHS staff dealing with this disease every day. Every second patient I saw yesterday on call, or on my ward this morning, had severe breathlessness from Covid-pneumonia that would take days to get over. Many of the others are confused or weak or dehydrated or have serious stomach upsets. Some deteriorate very rapidly and need additional help to breathe. For others, sadly, especially the older and frail or those with underlying lung and heart conditions or cancer it can be the last straw. With visiting and travel restrictions in place, doctors and nurses who’d prefer to speak with scared and upset patients’ relatives in person, and let them be with their loved one, spend a lot of time on distressing bad news phone calls. NHS friends and colleagues have died from Covid caught at work, or lost their own parents to it. While others have been advised to stay at home, we come into work surrounded by risk of infection. Many other NHS clinical staff have been hospitalised or are still suffering the effects of “long Covid”. Others are off sick or self-isolating – putting further pressure on the ones still at work. Some people arenapost happy about the lockdowns, the school closures, the behavioural restrictions and the mask wearing. I understand that. We’re all sick of it. We should take concerns about jobs, the economy and the impacts on health seriously. But some take this further by trying to tell us that the pressures on the NHS or the death rates are exaggerated. Walk a mile in the shoes of acute hospital staff, see what we see, look at the data and at least some of them would change their minds. One view doing the rounds from people who think we’ve gone too far in our Covid measures is that the virus only kills the old or the sick. So we just protect them better and “let the rest of us get on with our lives”.  You’ll see people arguing that less than  people under  with no existing medical conditions have been killed. Dig a bit deeper and you’ll see how daft this argument is. For starters, there are  million people over  in the UK, including . million over . That could be you, your parents, friends or family. Many are still very active and make a huge contribution as parents, grandparents, volunteers, employees and unpaid carers. Even the most frail are humans with human rights. Should we just write them off  Second, those people with “pre-existing conditions” - including those in their s, s and s - are not all people who would have died anyway. Covid takes years off their le expectancy. Those conditions arenapost just dementia or terminal cancer, but include diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma heart and kidney disease that people live and often work with for many years. Millions of people live with such conditions. Should we send them all to the Covid- knackers yard  Are they not worth bothering with "},{"url":null,"title":"mp calls government hand scouts","story":"NewsMP calls on Government to hand Scouts cash to save historic ex-HQ and campsiteEXCLUSIVE: A former minister said the Scout Association should be given money as it battles the coronavirus crisismirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  JAN NewsBaden-Powell House in London will be sold under plans revealed by the Scout Association \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But the proposals to sell Baden-Powell House – named after the movementaposs found Robert Baden-Powell – and the -acre campsite Downe Scout Adventures in Kent, have prompted calls for the Government to intervene. Labour MP Gareth Thomas, a former Business Minister, said other organisations helping youngsters received millions of pounds from taxpayers. He added: “The Scout Association is rightly a much-loved national institution and I hope ministers will meet as a matter of urgency with the Scout Association to help them stave off their Covid-related financial troubles. “Given the money ministers find to support similar organisations, like the National Citizen Service and the Army and Navy Cadets, it is only right that they should help the Scouts to avoid axing so many jobs and being forced to sell off their iconic former headquarters in central London, Baden-Powell House, and a much-loved, -acre campsite that has been dedicated to scouting for almost  years, into private hands.” In   the Ministry of Defence gave Britainaposs Cadet Forces “approximately £million”, according to parliamentary records. An April  report by a cross-party group of MPs and peers said % of all government spending on youth services went to the National Citizen Service. The NCS has previously been described as a “pet project” of David Cameron, who set up the initiative when he was Prime Minister. Mr Thomas believes the Scouts provide similar services for youngsters and should receive taxpayer help.

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The Government must do everything possible to slow down the spiralling rise in Covid- cases. “With the virus becoming more infectious, it’s more important than ever that people self-isolate when they develop symptoms. “But the lack of decent sick pay is undermining Britain’s public health effort and is forcing workers to choose between doing the right thing and being plunged into hardship. “Ministers must stop turning a blind eye to this problem and raise sick pay to at least the Real Living Wage of £ a week, and they must ensure that everyone has access to it.” By law, people must shut themselves awaythey are “pinged” by the NHS test and Trace app as having come into close contact with someone who tests positive or they test positive themselves.They should also self-isolatethey have any symptoms of the disease, are waiting for a coronavirus test result,someone they live with has symptoms or tests positive, orsomeone in their support bubble has symptoms or has tested positive. The TUC also called for an overhaul of outdated workplace safety rules to protect essential workers. Guidance for employers have not been fully updated since March  - despite advances in the scientic understanding of the virus. Transmission of Covid- is now understood to be mainly through infectious aerosols suspended in the air, rather than contact, which may mean protective measures are inadequate. Too many workers are still in indoor spaces without adequate ventilation, or proper social distancing from other staff or customers, Ms OaposGrady said.

Mrs Lee, , and her husband, Alan, , a former electrical engineer, had received the call to head to Clitheroe Health Centre only on Tuesday afternoon. Less than  hours later they were celebrating after being given the Pfizer  BioNTech vaccine within a few minutes of each other. A -minute wait inside the building and then they were given the all-clear to go home and await the top-up jab – most likely in about  weeks’ time.How do you think the vaccine rollout effort is going  Share your views in the comments below... The World Health Organization has refused to give its blessing to Britain’s plan to space the two doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine by more than a month. Officials in the UK have decided to use all available doses of the Pfizer BioNTech jab, which was the first to be approved, to get a single dose to as many people as possible. In the process they will leave people waiting up to  weeks for their second jab. The WHO said governments should be giving people their second dose within  to  days of having the first, to make sure the vaccine works long-term.  But it did not attack Britain’s decision not to do this, admitting the Government had been forced to make a dficult decision because of spiralling infections and deaths in recent weeks. Julia and Alan, who live in nearby Whalley, have spent most of the past year painstakingly trying to avoid coronavirus while all the time childminding their grandson, Daniel, now  months. “Overall, I think we feel a great sense of relief,” said Mr Lee. “They say thatyou’ve had the first vaccination and then get symptoms it won’t be so severe.  “That gives us hope for the future – and I imagine millions of other people will feel the same. It’s a fantastic step forward for all of us”. The Lees were among scores of pensioners and care home staff to be vaccinated in a slick, military-style operation overseen by medics and aided by volunteers from two local Rotary clubs. Bill Honeywell, , a local estate agent and past president of Clitheroe Rotary, was first to brave the sub-zero temperatures, arriving just before am to supervise a handful of other volunteers.  Thirty of these are fellow Rotarians, another  made up of local people who just want to chip in and help. Bill has organised them into shts so that a group of them are always on hand to marshal cars and help guide often frail pensioners in from the cold. “They’re just so grateful to be here,” said Bill. “A lot of them haven’t been out for maybe  months, so it’s a thrill just to be out in the open. “For them to be able to go away smiling after having the jab is a joy to behold. Their relatives are all incredibly relieved and thankful. We’ve had so many tins of biscuits dropped off as thank-yous that we’re going to pile on the pounds!” Despite requests from the health centre simply to arrive on time, a number have been turning up early – “just because they’re from a generation that likes to be punctual”.  They’ve also seen it as an occasion to dress up smartly for the doctor or nurse who administers the jab. “It feels such a privilege to be involved, and we’ll be here for as long as we’re needed. The quicker we can get the vaccine into people’s arms the better”. Wednesday’s operation was geared around the time of the vaccine’s arrival. No one at the health centre was quite sure when that would be, so appointments for the elderly had only been set from pm.  The two precious boxes containing the vials were dropped off by courier at .am. Their arrival triggered a chain reaction throughout the health centre. Dr Russell Robb, clinical director of the Ribblesdale Primary Care Network, was standing by to receive the vaccine. He signed for the packages before quickly carrying them to a fridge in the preparation room. Elsewhere in the health centre receptionists and admin staff began a flurry of calls to bring in more recipients. The first to be booked in were staff at local care homes who had already been put on standby.  And because the vaccine had arrived relatively early, staff were able to book in yet more pensioners for appointments starting at around am. In the preparation room, Dr Robb set about the delicate process of getting the vials ready for the vaccinations. Conventionally there are five vaccinations for each vial. But Clitheroe’s practitioners have picked up on the experience of others to raise that figure to six. Which means more people being vaccinated in a single day. The increase from five to six means that the health centre’s medics can administer , doses in a day rather than . And a busier sht for the staff on reception. They all know they have a total of three-and-a-half days to use this latest delivery.  Dr Robb’s sons, Fred, nine, and Arthur, five, have got used to his - hour weeks during the darkest days of the pandemic. But while they tell their friends that “Dad’s going out to solve Covid”, the reality is that he went on a specialist course on how to prepare and then to administer the vaccine. Those turning up to be vaccinated also come from satellite health centres in Whalley and Slaidburn.  Dr Robb, a one-time lieutenant in the Territorial Army, said: “I just feel very fortunate to be in a position where I can help this community. The faster we can get back to some kind of normality the faster we can tackle other issues we’ve not had time for”. He added: “There’s a real energy here to try to make sure we use the vaccine in a timely manner – a real go-get attitude. “I’m hoping that all our patients from  and older will have had a first vaccination by the end of May. It will be sooner than thatwe can get supplies.”  Dr Robb’s team have drawn up a reserve list of front-line staff to get the vaccine rather than see any of it going to waste. These include local teachers, firefighters, police, ambulance crews, dentists and clinical pharmacists. On Saturday he is planning to have every care home resident in the catchment area – just under  of them given a vaccination he hopes will prolong their lives. Anita Sorrell, , an activities coordinator at the local Abbeyfield House care home in Low Moor, Clitheroe, was among the first to be vaccinated on Wednesday. “I didn’t feel a thing,” she said as she waited the required  minutes to check for any adverse effect. “I feel very privileged to be able to have it. I’d only just got to work this morning when the health centre rang. It’s reassuring to me, but also to the residents. It gives them so much hope – especially now there’s another lockdown to get through”. Outside, Tony Perry, , had just helped a woman of  towards the temporary entrance at the back of the health centre.

Anyone who hopes to call Buckingham Palace, Sandringham or Windsor Castle their office faces a tough job interview process so the royal family family can ensure their staff are discreet and excellent at what they do. When it comes to hiring a new cleaner, the recruitment team have a strange test to spot the special cleaners amid the good ones. According to Tracey Waterman, the head of recruitment, the team put the secret challenge to all interviewees to see how they react. She explains that she will place a dead fly on the fireplace or carpet of the room to seethey notice it - and what they dothey spot it. Speaking during Channel aposs documentary Sandringham: The Royals at Christmas, she said: The dference between housekeeper in a five-star hotel and in a royal Palace would be attention to detail. One of the tests I like to do, to seea candidate has potential eye for detail, is to place a dead fly, either in the fireplace or on the carpet. Once the dead fly is placed, I then bring the candidate into the room. I lead them into the room quite slowly, just giving them a chance to glance at the room, have a little look at what we’ve got inside the room.  Bringing them to the fireplace, maybe highlighting that we’ve got a beautul fireplace. At this point I’d expect them to see the dead fly, and hopefully pick it up. But itaposs not just about spotting the fly, itaposs what they dothey do notice it. She adds: It’s a great test, maybe out of  people half the candidates will notice the fly. One out of ten will actually bend down and pick it up, that’s the special housekeeper. So there you have it - how to impress at a royal job interview. The Queen last hired a new apprentice cleaner in October, offering a salary of £,. And the aposhousekeeping assistantapos role came with another very exciting benefit - the chance to live at the palace. The job came with live-in accommodation and all meals provided, as well as expenses for travel. The job description read: It’s working as a team to achieve exceptional results.

Warnings for snow and ice likely to cause slippery surfaces and travel disruption until midnight on Wednesday are in place for Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the same warning is in place until am on Thursday morning. From Thursday afternoon until Friday morning, a yellow warning for ice covers the north and the entire east and west coasts of England and Wales, with only a small portion of central southern areas free from warnings.

Some  alerts, for areas where flooding is possible, are also scattered across England. There were no high water warnings in place for Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland on Wednesday night. Snowfall is expected in the northern half of Scotland on Thursday, with -cm depth covering lowland areas, and up to cm expected to fall in areas higher than m above sea level.

Yet almost four years on, the country is filled with more hate, death and destruction that has left it unrecognisable to the one I arrived in almost eight years ago. Amid of backdrop of Trump’s Tsunami of untruths, I’ve born witness to some of the most shameful events ever to take place in a supposed civilised society. They say journalism is the first rough draft of history, but only time will tell what will be taught in US high schools in  years time. Whether it will be America’s biggest ever mass shooting in Las Vegas, travelling to see a US leader toady up to murderous dictators, immigrant children being held in cages while separated from their parents, withdrawing from the fight against climate change or emboldening the rise of the deadly far-right, the list is endless. The writing was on the White House walls no sooner had Trump, and First Lady Melania moved in. Ever since, amid made-up crowd sizes, an obsession with Barack Obama, and “alternative facts,” the Trump presidency has been a factory of hoods from the get-go. It has churned out distortions, deceptions, conspiracy theories and brazen lies at a production-line pace that has fuelled an industry of fact-checkers. The firing of former FBI director James Comey was more signicant than most could have thought. During a dinner with his new boss, he was asked by Trump whether he would pledge loyalty to him.  Comey avoided making such a promise explaining his role was to serve the American people. Months later, he was fired without being told. Above all, it illustrated Trump’s disregard for the rule of law that has since seen him turn the US Department of Justice into his own legal firm. To then see Trump in July  side with Vladimir Putin against the FBI contradicting his own US intelligence agencies who said there had been Russian interference in the  election, was jaw-dropping. If allies like the UK had not been put on notice before the Helsinki summit over where the US leader’s feelings lay at that point they did. He single handily shattered America’s global image. Only the month before I had travelled to Singapore to see Trump meet with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un on the hope of striking a deal to de-escalate the rogue nation’s proleration of nuclear weapons. What followed was an abject failure on the Trump administration’s part, yet the President still crowed about how he “fell in love” with the murderous dictator. If the problems were not bad enough on a world stage, domestically they were worse. Shortly his inauguration, the simmering rise of the white nationalism emboldened under his leadership boiled over.  During a ‘Unite the Right Rally’ in August  members of the alt-right, neo-Confederates, neo-fascists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the KKK and ious right-wing militias marched on Charlottesville, Virginia. The event quickly turned violent when Hitler-loving James Field ran over  counter-protestors killing Heather Heyer. As the country became a tinder box of racial ide, Trump initially refused to comment, but I watched in New York as he then said there were “very fine people on both sides”. It was the first of many instances of his apparent support for the far-right that, along with the radical left, has seen many of America’s cities more recently go up in flames. The fact that now no one blinks an eye when the leader of the free is called a “racist”, should be of enormous concern to us all.  It was never more apparent in the wake of George Floyd’s death in May this year - killed after white cop Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. As I stood watching the city of Minneapolis looted and torched, it was a time for the President to show leadership - to bring together a country that was clearly hurt and in turmoil. Instead, Trump added fuel to the already burning fire pitting Black Lives Matter protestors against police and more shamefully white nationalist groups. Yet despite high-profile incidents of police violence against Black Americans in recent months, including the killing of Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake sparking nationwide protests, renewed calls for the removal of Confederate symbols and public condemnations of systemic racism from lawmakers, corporations, sports leagues and others, recent research shows adult white America feels largely unmoved.  Americans are sceptical the current moment of racial reckoning will lead to major changes in the States, according to a new Pew Research Centre survey. They found: “The public is about evenly split on whether the increased focus on issues of race and racial inequality in the country in the past three months will lead to major policy changes to address racial inequality - % say it will and % say it will not. “A sizable sharesay this will not lead to changes that will improve the lives of Black people. And while a majority say the heightened attention to racial issues represents a change in the way most Americans think about these issues, just % say this represents a major change.” They found overall, % of U.S. adults now say the country hasn’t gone far enough when it comes to Black people having equal rights with White people but “White Americans are virtually unchanged”.  But it’s not just races that Trump, who became only the third president ever to be impeached, ides, its gender too. We should have all known. While campaigning for the White House, he was heard on tape saying of women it was perfectly acceptable to “Grab ‘em by the p****. You can do anything.” Yet still, America’s females voted for him in their millions. He has repeatedly, even during this campaign, belittled women none more so than the two dozen who have accused him of sexual impropriety and even rape. In response to writer E. Jean Carroll’s claim, he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room at a Manhattan department store in the mid-s he simply replied: “She’s not my type”.  Yet despite the accusations, the evangelicals of America still embrace him as he claims to be a good Christian - “a man of God” - using the Bible as a prop for any photo opportunity. Even after his alleged  marital affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels came to light paying her off to keep her silent, that was ok with the church because he was now a “changed person”. If it were left to Trump, the Bible would no doubt read: “Let he who has bedded a porn star just after the birth of his fth child with his third we cast the first stone.” He also pushed for transgender servicemen and women - who unlike his dodge of the Vietnam draft were prepared to put their lives on the line for American freedoms, to be banned from the military. It’s challenging to know which of Trump’s policies have been for the greater good. There is no doubt he had continued to build on the economy inherited from Barack Obama and almost wiped ISIS from the earth. Still, his recent handling of the pandemic will go down as one of the worst disasters in US history.

It comes as the US Capitol was put on lockdown after protesters swarmed the historic building during a House of Congress vote confirming President-elect Joe Bidenaposs electoral win.  Violent scenes are unfolding in the heart of Washington DC in what has been described as close to a coup attempt this country has ever seen.

Today the the US Congress and Senate were confirming the Electoral College votes from the  presidential election, won by Biden.The breach has forced a delay in the constitutional process to affirm Bidenaposs victory in the November election, after Trump urged his supporters to travel to Washington to protest over Congressapos formal approval of the win.

The success was overshadowed events in Washington D.C, however, as pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol as the outcome of last Novemberaposs election was being confirmed. Democratic challenger Rev Raphael Warnock won a hotly contested run-off race, defeating Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, who took a page from Donald Trumpaposs playbook and refused to concede. Warnock, a -year-old Baptist preacher, is the first black US senator in Georgiaaposs history as the results signalled a sht in politics and the wider deep south. In the run-off for the stateaposs other seat, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, a -year-old documentary filmmaker, overcame Republican incumbent David Perdue by a wafer-thin margin.It was a crushing final defeat for Trump, the one-term president who has just two weeks left in office. No Democrat had won a US Senate race in Georgia for  years. Whataposs in store for America with Joe Biden as president  Join the conversation in the comments section below.Ossoffaposs lead was as slim as . per cent as ballots continued to be counted on Wednesday morning after the critical elections drew a record . million voters. Victory would make him the Senateaposs youngest member. Trump stands to be the first president since  to lose the White House and both chambers of Congress in a single term. The confirmation of the second seat being flipped to the Democrats came as a joint session of Congress was suspended in Washington and forced into recess as protesters fought their way past police, shouting and waving pro-Trump and US flags as they roamed through halls, demanding the election result be overturned.  The invasion sent members of Congress scrambling for cover under their seats and donning gas masks as tear gas was fired. A woman was shot dead inside the US Capitol during the chaos.Mr Trump, who had urged the demonstrators to march on the Congress, later called on them to go home, and had his Twitter account locked for  hours over tweets relating to the riots and baseless electoral fraud claims.Why were the run-offs so signicant  The outcome of the kne-edge elections determine control of the US Senate and President-elect Joe Bidenaposs chances of pushing through his legislative agenda over the next four years.Biden, who defeated Trump in Novemberaposs presidential election, will be sworn in on January .Trump still hasnapost conceded, despite Biden being the clear winner, and is still trying to steal the election with  election fraud claims. There is zero evidence of fraud.Republicans currently control the Senate and would maintain their grip by winning at least one of the Georgia seats. Maintaining control would allow them to block Bidenaposs agenda, a scenario that President Barack Obama faced during his time in the White House. The Republicans would wield veto power over Bidenaposs political and judicial appointees as well as many of his legislative initiatives in areas such as economic relief, climate change, healthcare and criminal justice. The Democrats needed to win both seats in Georgia to take the Senate majority. A Democratic sweep would create a - split in the Senate and give Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, the tie-breaking vote after she and Biden take office. The party already has a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, meaning a sweep in Georgiaaposs run-off elections would give them control of Congress.  Run-off elections were held because none of the candidates won % of the vote in November.Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and a top election official in Georgia, told CNN thatthe Democrats won both senate seats the losses would fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his actions since November .Many white suburbanites in Georgia have increasingly abandoned the Republican party under Trump. There was an unprecedented number of black voters for a run-off vote. Georgiaaposs first black US senator Warnock, who was pastor at the Atlanta church were Martin Luther King Jnr preached,is set to become the first black US senator from Georgia, a state where . per cent of the population identied as black or African American in the  census. As he addressed his supporters, he recalled his humble upbringing as one of  children of a woman who worked in cotton fields. He said: Because this is America, the -year-old hands that used to pick somebody aposs cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator.

But when she arrived home, the woman realised the detailing on Minnieaposs skirt could easily be mistaken for something rude. The doormat features the two Disney icons facing each other with a red heart between them. The woman shared a video showing off the doormat on TikTok and joked: Picked up the cutest mat today and realised when I got home that something was up was Minnie. She zoomed in on the mouseaposs flouncy skirt to explain what she meant. The video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times since being shared three days ago, with viewers flooding the comment section with laughing emojis.

Some drivers have reportedly been waiting  hours.The latest delays follow major hold-ups just before Christmas when other countries responded to a big jump in new iant Covid- cases in the UK by introducing travel restrictions – effectively cutting off Britain.Scottish seafood industry bosses feared many small firms could “go to the wall” after missing out on their biggest market of the year due to the chaos at the UK-French border.French authorities later announced that journeys from the UK would be allowed to resume after the coronavirus ban was lted.But at least , freight lorries, many carrying produce to premium markets on the continent, had been sat at Dover for days with their high-value loads spoiling.Some of the lorries were estimated to be carrying around £, worth of Scottish seafood each.Many headed back home while others managed to negotiate alternative routes across the water, entering Europe through Belgium and the Netherlands.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/12/PJ-KE-250918-03-003_27143418-e1607950918980-940x564.jpg ","title":"charity calls for action plan to help north east elderly access key items","story":"A leading charity has called on ministers to protect vulnerable people in the north-east after much of the UK was placed into lockdown.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced earlier this week that tougher measures to combat Covid- would , amid fears over rising case numbers and a new strain of the virus.However, during the first lockdown in March last year many vulnerable people # particularly the elderly # struggled to access key items such as food.Now Age Scotland, which supports elderly people across the country, has urged the Scottish Government to put together an #action plan# to ensure they do not have to go without.The charity#s head of policy and communications Adam Stachura said: “These measures are no doubt necessary to get to grips with the rapid spread of the virus. However, thisto a national lockdown similar to March of last year will be a bitter pill to swallow, particularly for the hundreds of thousands of older people living alone.“The thought of enduring another lockdown without face-to-face contact with family or friends will be extremely dficult but this is clearly not a decision that has been taken lightly.“We have seen the toll this virus has already taken on Scotland’s older population and, while the continuation of the vaccine rollout offers some peace of mind, the new faster spreading iant is cause for concern and makes these new measures essential.“The past year has proven that periods of prolonged isolation can have a profound impact on mental and physical health but, by reaching out and offering support where possible, we can all play our part in alleviating the impact of lockdown loneliness.“At the beginning of the pandemic, we saw an incredible outpouring of support, with people volunteering across the country to help with food delivery, collecting prescriptions – or simply a friendly phone call or doorstep chat. With shielding guidance expected soon, many older people may once again need help getting food and other essentials. We hope to see a continuation of this community support and would urge people to look out for older friends, neighbours and relatives they know will be affected by this guidance.“Back in October, we asked the Scottish Government to develop a winter action plan to support older people, particularlywe had another lockdown. It is vital that they make available and ensure a full range of support to those who need help with accessing food, and medical attention and prescriptions. These were considerable challenges for older people last spring and they mustn’t have the same dficulty this time around.“We want older people to know that we are there for them. Our free Helpline is available to offer advice, information and friendship to anyone who needs it. Please don’t hesitate to give us a call on    . As we re-enter a state of national lockdown, older people need to know they are not facing this dficult period alone.”Aberdeen city councillor Steve Delaney, who won cross-party backing for a motion on support for those living alone during the pandemic, said lockdown was #necessary# # but warned it could lead to more older people becoming isolated.He said: “This is going to be hard for all of for dferent reasons but it once again has the potential to hit people who live alone, the hardest.#The Scottish Government needs to ensure sufficient resources are made available organisations who support people living alone who have no family support.#These would include mental health charities and others supporting elderly people and people with disabilities.#North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald added: “The new mutation of Covid- seems to affect more people more quickly, including younger people, but older people remain at greatest risk. One in five of those over  who contract Covid will die as a result.“Age Scotland are therefore right to highlight the importance of supporting older people, who need to stay at home to stay safe. We need to look out for the older people we know, whether friends, family or neighbours, and public bodies need to make sure they get the support they need.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Social isolation and loneliness is a public health issue and can have wide-ranging negative health impacts. Living through an extended period when we have been unable to spend time with our friends and loved ones has been particularly challenging.#We know how dficult the pandemic has been for older people, many of whom have been unable to see their friends and loved ones in a normal way for months. We are acutely aware of the wide-ranging negative health impacts of social isolation and loneliness, which is why we announced a £ million winter package in September to help provide friendship and human connection to people at risk of social isolation and loneliness over the winter months.“We have also made £ million of funding available to local authorities already at protection level  to strengthen their local response and support the needs of people in their communities who don’t have support networks and are struggling with the restrictions or guidance, particularly those most at risk through health or social inequalities.#This could include people at higher clinical risk, older people or disabled people who encounter barriers that emerge, for example in accessing food and other essential items.”“As before, we can all help by looking out for others. Some people will continue to rely on family, friends and neighbours for help with getting food and other essentials.#But anyone who needs additional advice, information, support or help, can call the free National Assistance Helpline on   which continues to provide a free-phone connection to local authorities which can provide additional support including access to food, pharmacy, social services, emotional support and third sector services or volunteers.#Advice on how to get helpyou need it, and on how you can safely help others in your community is also available at ready.scot”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks from castle dounie to serpentine ridges","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time. All walks are undertaken at your own risk. Please continue to adhere to current guidelines as set out by the government, exercise responsibly and use appropriate clothing and equipment for your chosen outdoor activity.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online. It will bring to le an exciting new piece of writing by award-winning poet and Scots Makar, Jackie Kay, creating Scotlandrsquos first-ever large-scale drone show and the largest drone show ever seen in the UK.Around  drones will create iconic images and words in the Scottish sky set to original words and music by Jackie Kay and Skyersquos Niteworks.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors. Throughout the trial, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of all charges.On March , Clap For Carers was launched - coined up as a way to show appreciation for those on the NHS and other frontline services during the pandemic.The event saw people taking to their doorsteps and windows at pm every Thursday to clap, cheer, ring bells and play bagpipes to show their support.The last formal clap took place on May , followed by an extea Clap for NHS on July  marking the nd anniversary of its establishment.AprilOn April , the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and wider Commonwealth, in which she thanked people for following social distancing rules and said the UK ldquowill succeed in its fight against the coronavirus.Echoing the words of Vera Lynnrsquos wartime song, she added ldquoWe will meet again.On the same day, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dt Catherine Calderwood resigned after facing intense criticism for breaking lockdown rules twice to visit her second home during the pandemic.Dr Calderwood concluded with the First Minister that her position was untenable given the need for consistent and trustworthy public health messaging.Sticking with the pandemic, all eyes were on -year-old war veteran Tom Moore on April , who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities for walking more than  laps of his garden.In less joyful news, just four days later on April , Scotlandrsquos new temporary coronavirus hospital the NHS Louisa Jordan opened to receive Covid patients.MayOn May , Boris Johnsonrsquos senior advisor Dominic Cummings faced calls to resign after an investigation alleged he travelled  miles from London to his parentrsquos home in Durham while displaying coronavirus symptoms during lockdown.On May , Cummings held a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, in which he said: ldquoI donrsquot regret what I did. The following day, Tory MP for Moray Douglas Ross, resigned as a Scotland Office minister over his views on the alleged breach.JuneOn June , a man with a kne stabbed six people, including a police officer and hotel staff, in the Park Inn Hotel in Glasgow.The attacker, Badreddin Abadlla Adam, was shot dead by a police officer on the scene.Police said the incident was not being treated as terrorism.JulyAfter a tough few months, beer gardens were allowed to reopen from July  ndash taking advantage of some warm weather that was about to come.Following weeks of guidance, Scotland made it officially law to make it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland on July .AugustPupils in Scotland finally began ing to classrooms on August , without the need to socially distance ndash with pupils initially not having to wear face coverings. This was later changed on August , requiring the need for masks in corridors, canteens and other communal areas.The following day, on August , three people died after a passenger train derailed in Aberdeenshire.The . ScotRail service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street hit a landslide near to Stonehaven following heavy rain and thunderstorms.The victims were named as driver Brett McCullough, , conductor Donald Dinnie, , and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, .SeptemberOn September , the NHS Protect Scotland app was released to the public on iOS and Android devices, providing anonymous and Bluetooth-enabled contact tracing for those who download it in Scotland.On September , Nicola Sturgeon announced a ban on meeting in households as she came down hard following a rise in cases across the country.A pm curfew on pubs, similar to that already in place in England, was also confirmed.OctoberOn October , Margaret Ferrier, MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, was suspended by the SNP and referred herself to the police after it became known she had travelled from Scotland to Westminster the previous weekend, despite awaiting the outcome of a Covid test.She then chose to travel home again by train, despite being notied of the positive result.And on October , James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery died at the age of .The Scottish actor, best known for his portrayal of the  spy, died in his sleep in the Bahamas ldquohaving been unwell for some time, his son said.NovemberA new five level, or ldquotier, system of lockdown was introduced in Scotland on November , bringing in new targeted restrictions to dferent parts of the country.And after an agonising two-decade long wait, Scotlandrsquos menrsquos team finally reached the finals of a major football tournament after beating Serbia on penalties.A masterclass penalty save from keeper David Marshall sent Scotland through, with subsequent celebrations leading to the rise of now Tartan Army-favourite Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, to the top of the charts.DecemberWhat could only be described as a potential light at the end of the tunnel, the first coronavirus vaccinations were administered in Scotland on December .Thousands of people have so far been given their first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, which after two doses is thought to be % effective against Covid-.However, the good news didnrsquot last long, and following an outbreak of a new strain of Covid in the UK, the co-ordinated plan for Christmas across the UK was cancelled on December .Nicola Sturgeon announced a travel ban to other parts of the UK during the festive period, with people within Scotland only allowed to ease the rules on Christmas Day ndash not between December  and  as previously planned.On Boxing Day, Scotlandrsquos toughest levels of lockdown came into effect across all mainland areas, with schools now no longer resuming in the classroom until at least January .The tough new rules mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gums will close for at least four weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"steak-pie-scottish-new-years-day-tradition","story":"SCOTS love a steak pie to celebrate the New Year and cannot get enough of them, according to an industry expert.But therersquos a surprising reason as to why itrsquos become an annual tradition across the country.Bruce McColl, the member services manager for the Scottish Craft Butchers Association, was able to provide some insight into our January  delight.He said: ldquoOne theory holds that steak pie became the national dish at New Years because January  wasnrsquot generally taken as a holiday so families were too busy to cook, said Mr McColl.ldquoThey would buy steak pies to feed their families instead, this continues to this day as people want a delicious meal after the previous nightrsquos celebrations.ldquoSo it was essentially one of the first ready meals.Steak pie then could be the nationrsquos hangover cure on what is often the roughest morning of the year for many, after a night of celebratory drinking.Mr McColl added: ldquoThe other train of thought is that people would have it as their main meal on Hogmanay before they started to drink.ldquoItrsquos a good meal to be made in advance so a lot of people have it as their main meal before the bells.ldquoAnother theory is that because it is a big meal you can keep warm and serve to visitors throughout the day, as people come to the house.Steak pie, it seems, fits Scotlandrsquos New Years celebrations perfectly -

household and exercising.The number of times you can exercise is not limited, although group exercise is banned.The \"stay at home\" message will be backed up by law, starting from tomorrow .The First Ministersaid the Scottish Government needed to \"act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS\".It comes as the new iant of COVID- continues to spread across Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said the new iant accounts for almost half of all new cases in the country.\"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned now than I have been at any time since March,\" said Ms Sturgeon.Schools will now stay closed for a further two weeks until February  - with plans to reopen on January  scrapped.The new lockdown means that outdoor gatherings are limited to two people from two dferent households.Anyone  or under will not be counted towards that number.Travel restrictions remain in place, with cross-border journeys banned unless essential.Places of worship will have to close again.Ms Sturgeon said that the new measures would not be \"in place any longer than necessary\", but warned that the lockdown could continue past February .The First Minister added that the Borders is currently at more than % of its COVID hospital capacity."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeons-coronavirus-announcement-full-lockdown-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland will enter a national lockdown.As of midnight tonight, it will now be a legal requirement for people to stay at home unless for essential travel.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.\"The First Minister added: \"Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"The decisioncomes as cases of Covid- have dramatically risen across the country, with, new positive cases announced today.Heres the key points from todays announcement:Stay at home messageFrom tomorrow,you live in a Level  areayou cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose - much like back in March.This means when you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Schools will stay closedNicola Sturgeon confirmed that schools will stay closed until February  for the majority of pupils.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is, in addition, to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.How can I report a rule breach You can report a breach taking part in Scotland by accessing the form here.The form is for reporting breaches and isnot meant for reporting emergencieswith the police still advising members of the publicto call  in an emergency.Recent Covid- hotspots:"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-new-lockdown-rules-borders","story":"THE Borders is going back into a full-scale lockdown for at least four weeks.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced todaythat mainland Scotland will see strict coronavirus rulesenforced from midnight until at least February .These rules will be even tighter than the Level  measures which forced the closure of pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops.During her statement, Ms Sturgeon outlined what the new restrictions will mean for mainland Scotland.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They race out of their cars to help people load shopping into the boot, or help elderly people into the car, and often carry the heavy bags to customers# homes.Taxi drivers are a leline for elderly people all across the country and I hope ours know that we notice all the little things they do to go the extra mile.Name and address supplied.The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will, for the first time, intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory Government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

It is unrealistic to think these slots can be cancelled and re-booked with just a few days’ notice and there is a very real risk that thousands of these vaccination slots will be wasted.#This flies in the face of the Scottish Government’s plans to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible.#The Scottish Government needs to honour the agreed dates for the second dose vaccinations to prevent wastage and any undue stress on already under-pressure health and social care staff.#Willie Duffy, UNISON Scotland#s head of health, said: #There was no consultation with trade unions on this policy change and it is not supported by clear evidence from Pfizer which will seriously diminish the trust and confidence of staff who had consented to the two doses.#There is also widespread confusion, inconvenience of rescheduling and, more importantly, a serious risk that doses of the vaccine may need to be destroyed due to lack of time to make new appointments for first doses for other staff.#It is vital the Scottish Government sees sense and commits to the scheduled second dose vaccination dates.#"},{"url":null,"title":"cards stacked in industrys favour says nfus president","story":"Marian MillerUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online. It will bring to le an exciting new piece of writing by award-winning poet and Scots Makar, Jackie Kay, creating Scotlandrsquos first-ever large-scale drone show and the largest drone show ever seen in the UK.Around  drones will create iconic images and words in the Scottish sky set to original words and music by Jackie Kay and Skyersquos Niteworks.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash. However, it typically scored highly for occupant protection in a iety of crash scenarios, as well as for having an emergency call system."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-tell-laura-bbc-loves","story":"WATCHING the TV news can be a dispiriting affair, points out David Kirkwood.

Are their possible achievements and  to  years of productive le less valuable than an extra five to  years of le for the elderly or chronically ill, notwithstanding the emotional consequences  Some might argue about the ethics, but in an existential crisis the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.Teachers fear catching the disease from children although the risk is very small. For the safety of one teacher the education of - children is cancelled. Teachers and school staff should all be prioritised for inoculation at the earliest opportunity. During the month-long closure all school staff can have two doses of the vaccine. Not to do this is illogical and causes greatest harm to the largest number.The dficulties in the health service are manest in the number of staff self-isolating or ill and thus unavailable for work. Those staff are also terried of catching the disease and exporting it home. The general NHS has been effectively destroyed and elective care abandoned, and it may never recover. It is scandalous healthcare staff are not also inoculated now to protect them while caring for the sick.Test and trace is only effective for contained local outbreaks of a disease. When that disease is widespread it is pointless. Someone clear one day can be infected the next day. If the structures for test and trace are available, and school children, teachers and NHS staff are contained in place, surely testing should be abandoned and inoculation substituted The Scottish Government and Ms Sturgeon are trapped in a failure whirlpool of their own making and the nation is being harmed permanently by blind adherence to failing policies, tardiness, dishonesty and lack of contrition.

But as we know, at that time popularity was the name of the game ndash from one man whose desperation and very existence is to be liked and popular and from one woman whose desperation and very existence is to be listened to and to be hailed as \"one of the people\".Yesterdayboth leaders spoke, and for the very first time, in my opinion the Prime Minister spoke and behaved and delivered in a much superior manner to the First Minister the former articulated seriouslyand as a statesman told what had to be done, for a total of eight minutes the latter, as usual, rambled on seriously , explaining what had to be done and, of course, sympathising with us all, for what appeared to be an eternity.I know the situation cannot be taken lightly, but this sort of repetitive approach, taken every time by the First Minister when she speaks, makes her watchers and listeners turn off the TV or radio, despite what she and her ardent followers may think.Walter Paul, Glasgow G.NOT JUST MS FOOD...THE new coronavirus lockdown was a shock-down for some people.

I experienced the same feelings as Bill Murrayrsquos character reading Ronald J Sandfordrsquos letterwhich reheats several of the  scare stories.First of all, when Juan Manuel Barroso gave his opinion it concerned the possibility of Scotland, then part of the EU within the UK, remaining an EU member even on independence. That possibility has of course been rendered totally irrelevant by Brexit, and unless someone wants to argue that an independent Scotland would simply be unacceptable to the EU, then the issue is done with.On independence, therefore, we will not be members of the EU for a period that might be longer or shorter, depending on the above considerations. However, this makes even more attractive the suggestion by Dr Tim Rideout, an influential member of the Scottish Currency Group, that on independence, Scotland could seek membership of EFTA , committing to the European Economic Area, which would give us access to the single market, freedom of movement and more. Subsequently, a referendum could be held on whether to apply to join the EU, depending on the outcome of negotiations, butthe terms were unsuitable, we could stay in EFTA.Lastly, Mr Sandford, Spain has consistently taken the view that as long as Scottish independence is achieved by constitutional means they will have nothing to say. Alfonso Dastis, Foreign Minister to Mariano Rajoy, has said ldquo [Scottish independence] happens legally and constitutionally, we would not block [EU membership]. His successor in the Sanchez government, Josep Borrell, has said ldquoWhy not  If they leave Britain in accordance with their internal regulation,Westminster agrees ...,These scares ldquoare old.

Many will often view Scotland as nicely wrapped within a lovely box, tied with a charming tartan bow. Of course, such a positive view is not harmful, in fact, it can be beneficial.What is lacking in America is a depth of understanding about Scotland as an innovative, entrepreneurial, and progressive nation. The Biden Administration is listening and seems to understand the gt Scotland offers the world is so much more profound than to simply view it and the Scottish people as merely delightful.First Minister Sturgeon, numerous Scottish ministers and MPs representing Scotland have made important connections with U.S. leaders over the years and reinforced this message.One excellent connection the FM Sturgeon made was with then Deputy Secretary of State Blinken. It is valuable that Scotland and the United States have an existing relationship between the FM and the future Secretary of State on which to build.The U.S. Government would be wise to expand its presence in Scotland for strategic and economic reasons. Currently, the U.S. has one Foreign Service Officer based in Edinburgh who serves effectively in the U.S. Consulate as Principal Officer.A new U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. should make a tactical stroke to relocate a handful of commercial, political, and economic officer positions from London to cover regions across Scotland. Doing so will signicantly enrich the ambassadorrsquos knowledge as an advisor to President Biden and Secretary Blinken.The ambassador would better comprehend the political and economic dynamics in the U.K. and Europe, position the U.S. for the COP in Glasgow, improve the grasp of understanding of the U.S. Scottish trading relationship, and aid in forging more partnerships between U.S. and Scottish entities across sectors.Further, with a wider tactical presence, U.S. leaders will see how Scotland is leveraging sectors and offering a policy blueprint for other nations, businesses, and communities when it comes to hydrogen and net-zero policy, tech innovation, inclusion, wind-power, healthcare, human rights, le sciences, and caring for vulnerable populations.While these are dficult budget times in Scotland with an historic need to prioritize caring for those impacted by the pandemic, a fundamental international question is on the table. Should Scotland commit more resources to widen strategic relationships throughout the United States  The Scottish Office within the British Embassy in Washington, DC continues to do outstanding work. I am always amazed by how much they shoulder, lt, and achieve.Also, the broader teams in the British Embassy and British Consulates around the U.S. are an effective voice for all nations comprising the United Kingdom. Scottish interests in the U.S. are also aided by a wider community of Scottish groups, societies, organisations and advocates including Scottish Development International, Scottish Business Network, the GlobalScot network, ScotWeek, Entrepreneurial Scotland, among many other actors.Clearly this capacity is having a positive effect, but a greater potential impact is being left unrealized. Scotland must find a way to build on a strong existing foundation and invest more into scaling up in the U.S. Doing so will secure tangible benefits for Scottish enterprise, culture, trade, tourism, research, and academia at a key moment.A fresh foreign policy vision by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the incoming team for Europe and beyond offers an opportunity for the United States and Scotland to forge modern links. Scotland can build on its own lsquospecial relationshiprsquo with the United States by launching a more assertive, strategic, and creative plan backed with more capacity building resources. And as the United States develops a renewed global approach, it can enlarge its footprint in Scotland while fully respecting and expanding its key connection with the U.K. A deeper partnership between Scotland and the U.S. is not only mutually beneficial, but valuable for the U.K., Europe, and the larger global community.Ian Houston has spent his career in Washington, DC as an international non-profit leader, a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation, and intercultural dialogue.

He echoes what seems to be accepted generally and without question that for some reason children are at low risk of virus infection and of passing it on. If that is the case, do children have some inherent immunity, which presumably diminishes as they grow up, which should be researched, identied, isolated and passed over to adults as an alternative or additional treatment to vaccination Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.PUBLISH DAILY VACCINE FIGURESTHE Covid vaccination programme is probably the most vital and important public health exercise in modern history. Notwithstanding, given comments made be either Nicola Sturgeon or Jeane Freeman over the last  hours, I have heard or read at least six dferent versions of their expected Covid vaccination timetable in terms of who will be vaccinated and by when. This is a disgrace. Once again, like the flu jab fiasco, John Swinneyrsquos education mess-up last year and other examples too many to mention here, this indicates this SNP administrations complete inability to manage anything effectively or efficiently.Since March last year, Ms Sturgeon has managed to find ample resources to both compile and produce her daily political broadcast ndash sorry, Covid update ndash so why can she now not find resources to deliver a daily update on vaccination progress against a clearly articulated timetable  This is what we want to hear from her, not her ongoing, daily, repetitive political jibes, nor her monotonous and very isive independence monologue.Paul McPhail, Glasgow G.JAG ROLL-OUT MUST NOT FAILI WAS more than pleased when my -year-old brother contacted me yesterday to advise that he had just received his first Covid vaccination. He lives in Essex, where NHS England has commenced the roll-out of a major vaccination programme which is intended to immunise the entire top four priority groups by mid-February this includes all the over-seventies, NHS workers, care home staff and care home residents in addition to people with underlying health problems, amounting to more than  million people. This is an exceptionally ambitious target, but one which the Prime Minister is confident of achieving.Under the circumstances it is not unreasonable to expect that here in Scotland we can achieve similar success with a vaccination roll-out that includes the most vulnerable groups over a similar time frame. Should the Scottish Government fail to deliver a successful vaccination programme, at speed, and without similar problems to those experienced with last yearrsquos flu vaccine debacle, then it will never be forgiven by the Scottish public.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.TRAINING IS A LONG SLOGI READ with real concern in your front-page report todaythat a number of health care staff in Glasgow yesterdayhad been unable to get their Covid- vaccine as had been originally scheduled.Undoubtedly such a mass immunisation programme requires a considerable amount of planning and effort, including recruitment of vaccinators. I have been practising as a GP for  years and I first offered to be a vaccinator as part of the hospital community hub vaccination programme on December . I received an email on December  inviting me to complete the online training, which I did ndash this taking me six hours, but which unlike as has been reported to be the case in England, did not include compulsory modules in de-radicalisation or equality and ersity. On December  I submitted my completed application and currently await to find outmy skills can be useful to the vaccination effort. Cases of Covid- continue to rise, but at this point Irsquom not too sure that the vaccine is outrunning the virus.Dr Alan Mitchell, Motherwell.WHY MESS WITH THE PROGRAMME NICOLA Sturgeon has stated that no one would be receiving a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a possible second dose with the Oxford vaccine. Surely no one in the health boards had even considered that scenario  I am also at a loss as to how they can suddenly change the period gap between jags, from  days to  weeks, without any check on the effect of same.There have already been some doubts on the suitability of the existing vaccines for keeping the Covid iant at bay, let alone the now additional one appearing on the scene, so why mess with the initial vaccine programme George Dale, Beith.HOW HAS IT COME TO THIS WHEN you are into ldquoextra-time in the game of le as I am, lockdown is a disaster. I know thatI catch Covid- the chances are it will kill me. Like many old fogies Irsquove been in what is essentially self-imposed lockdown for the best part of a year and as of now even that regime will be ramped up. Gone completely will be the already-infrequent outdoor visits to kids and grandkids, even a daily walk which is already compromised by being compelled to walk on the road to avoid groups of adolescents who ignore social distancing or ignorant berks who feel it more important that their dog-on-a-string walks on the pavement than a pensioner, will be threatened. Heaven forfend one runs out of milk the risk of premature death has to be balanced against having a decent cup of tea.Just how badly managed the response to the pandemic has been is encapsulated by the fact that almost a year into things only now are they considering closing the door to the country. For heavenrsquos sake we live on an island, it should have been the first thing they did. How is it possible that groups were shuttling back and forwards to European ski resorts recently  Air-bridges pathetic. Now we have a virus iant that got here from South Africa on a plane and another highly contagious mutant domestic form of Covid- that appeared in the heavily-populated south-east of England, its development and transmission facilitated by Government policy of trying to keep le as near normal as possible to protect the economy rather than the population.Less than a year into the pandemic the UK seasonally adjusted level of deaths is nearer , than the official Covid- statistics, mainly elderly poor or BAME casualties.

And found that online banking failed to log out consumers when switching to a dferent site .It also found that the website failed to log out consumers when switching to a dferent website or using the forward back button to leave the session andto it.TSB finished second from bottom with a score of  per cent.But the research found that TSB customers do at least enjoy some \"peace of mind\" due to the bankrsquos fraud refund guarantee, which ensures the \"vast majority\" of scam victims get their money back.Santander rounded off the bottom three, with a score of  per cent. Testers found that authentication checks when logging in can be bypasseda user designates a device as lsquotrustedrsquo.It was the not so big names that performed better.Starling came out on top, with a score of  per cent. Experts found nothing concerning with its recently launched online banking website.But they said this is partly due to limited ality, as users can only change sensitive data via the app.Unlike most banks, there were no issues with missing security headers and it scored top marks for encryption.Which  is calling for the voluntary bank transfer scams code to be overhauled so that stronger consumer protections and reimbursement for fraud victims become mandatory for all banks and payment providers.The code developed by the banking industry and consumer groups and launched in May, , compensates those who are tricked into transferring money directly to a fraudster, in situations where neither the victim, nor their bank, is to blame.Previously, victims of authorised push paymentscams had lost large amounts of cash forever, because they had authorised the transfer and so were not entitled to claim the money back from their bank.More than pound. million has been reimbursed to thousands of customers since the code was introduced.But concerns persist that banks are not applying the code in a unorm manner and may sometimes be interpreting the code too narrowly by expecting customers to have sophisticated financial knowledge or relying on customers seeing generic scam warnings as a reason to turn down claims.Which  said the FCA should be required to regularly publish reimbursement rates of inidual banks so consumers can check on their account providerrsquos performance.Many of the banks included in the investigation were signed up to the industry code on bank transfer scams, which pledges to reimburse scam victims who are not at fault.However, the number of victims who get their money ed by banks is worryingly low, standing at around the  per cent mark, the consumer organisation said.Because firms apply the code inconsistently and are not required to publish their reimbursement rates, scam victims face a \"lottery\" when it comes to getting their money back, it said.Harry Rose, editor of Which  said: ldquoBanks must lead the battle against fraud, yet our security tests have revealed a big gap between the best and worst providers when it comes to keeping people safe from the threat of having their account compromised.ldquoThe serious failings we have exposed with some providers reinforce the need for banks to up their game on scam protections, and for greater transparency and stronger standards on fraud reimbursement to be made mandatory for all banks and payment providers.TSB said: \"Providing customers with safe and secure banking is a priority and we continue to invest in strengthening online and mobile protection for customers.\"We are the only bank that offers a guarantee to refund all innocent victims of fraud ndash including those who lose money to online scams.\"Tesco Bank said it will consider the findings when prioritising \"potential areas for further enhancement\" to customer security this year \"against other customer and risk priorities\"\"At Tesco Bank, we take the security of our customers very seriously. Many of the security measures we use on customersrsquo behalf are not visible to external parties, and these measures invalidate a number of the findings of this survey. Customers can be assured we have robust security measures in place to protect them and their accounts.ldquoWe use the latest technology to protect and manage the security of online banking and our mobile banking app, giving customers peace of mind they can bank safely and securely with us.

It is thought to be a reference to an independent Scotland.One MP, who attended the , explained: ldquoEssentially, the point the Prime Minister was making is that the UK is a major country, wersquove got sufficient clout to get the vaccines rolled out. He did actually mention that we were ahead of the rest of Europe.ldquoHe saidit were up to the SNP, then there wouldnrsquot have been a single vaccine delivered in Scotland. It was a UK effort in other words it needed the clout of a big government.Asked about the PMrsquos remarks, his press spokeswoman at a Downing St briefing declined to comment directly, saying she was not present and did not hear the conversation.However, she noted: ldquoBut, in terms of the broader point about the vaccine, there is no doubt that the Union has been critical in the development, production and administration of the vaccine. Across a range of measures the UK Government during this pandemic, wersquove all worked together to provide for the British people.ldquoI think Nicola Sturgeon said on Monday theyrsquove , vaccines in Scotland, itrsquos great news for the Scottish people, but itrsquos been a collective effort.Earlier in the Commons, Mr Johnson responded to a question from SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford about what was being done to ldquoramp up supplies of vaccine vials.The PM bemoaned how the tenor of the Highland MPrsquos question ignored how the whole of the UK had ldquobenefited massively from the natural strength of the UK economy, the ability of the UK Treasury to make these commitments.He added: ldquoThe mere fact Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, every part of the United Kingdom, has received the vaccine is entirely thanks tohellipour United Kingdom NHS[and] the strength of UK companies that we are able to distribute a le-saving vaccine across the whole of our country.On Tuesday, the First Minister suggested her Government had been ahead of Mr Johnsonrsquos in seeking to get the latest Covid wave under control.Referring to her decision to close places of worship in Scotland while they are being kept open in England, the First Minister said: ldquoIt is one of the points of dference between Scotland and the UK but so is the fact we decided to act much earlier in the curve of this wave of the pandemic to get it under control.ldquoWe are trying to act as cautiously as we can at the moment to stop this situation deteriorating any further, she added.Last night, an SNP spokesman responded to Mr Johnsonrsquos remarks, saying: ldquoThese comments are as crass as they are inaccurate and show once again how desperate the Tories are to politicise the pandemic.ldquoThe development of vaccines has been a global effort and our focus is on ensuring we vaccinate people in Scotland as quickly and as safely as it is possible to do so, he added.The row broke out as No  sought to end another one by pointing out the Scottish Government on Christmas Eve received an extra poundm in front-loaded funding in its battle against Covid-.The Treasury was condemned for ldquoshort-changing Scotland by the SNP and Scottish Labour after it emerged that pound million, mentioned initially by the Treasury as being an additional payment to the Scottish Government - as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunakrsquos pound. billion new aid package to help see businesses through the latest lockdown ndash was in fact part of an earlier front-loaded funding package, the so-called multi-billion pound Barnett Guarantee, to help Edinburgh fight the virus.Asked about the poundm, the PMrsquos spokesman explained: ldquoAs the Chancellor said, funding is being provided for the devolved administrations as part of our Barnett Guarantee. For example, in Scotland itrsquos been recently increased by poundm on December . So, the Chancellor has provided pound.bn to the Scottish Government to support them through the pandemic.He added: ldquoThe Guarantee is reviewed regularly to ensure it always reflects additional funding.Meanwhile, Mr Blackford urged Mr Johnson to learn from his ldquopast mistakes and close the UK border to ldquoall but essential travel to stop new strains entering the country.The PM insisted the Government was protecting the border as evidenced in response to the South African strain of the virus, saying: ldquoWersquoll bring forward further measures to stop the readmission of the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-schools-not-ready-online-learning","story":"The Scottish Secondary Teachersrsquo Associationhas warned that staff will struggle to follow normal class timetables while juggling in-person teaching, online lesson delivery and the needs of their own children.Highlighting reports that supply contracts in some areas have been axed, it also accused education leaders of ldquosharp practice.The criticisms come after plans for the new term were revised amid concern over the emergence of a more transmissible Covid strain.Schools re-opened on Tuesday for vulnerable youngsters and the children of key workers, while remote learning for all other pupils is due to begin on Monday and last until at least January .Arrangements are to be reviewed on January , taking into account evidence about the Covid- iant and progress in reducing community transmission levels.Seamus Searson, SSTA General Secretary, said: ldquoThere will have to be a realisation of what can and cannot be achieved by schools as we go along but I donrsquot think thishas been realised.\"Things have not been worked out properly.

It seems it was decided in some places, lsquoah schools are closed, we donrsquot need to spend that money anymorersquo, even though John Swinney has put additional money in to aid education recovery.ldquoThatrsquos what I would call sharp practice.There have also been reports of schools asking all teachers to come in to look after key worker and vulnerable children, even though Scottish Government guidance species that attendance should be restricted to staff necessary for the implementation of revised reopening arrangements.Mr Searson said: ldquoWersquove had schools in some local authorities ndash even up to [Tuesday] night ndash telling all of their staff to come in because they hadnrsquot established exactly how many key worker and vulnerable children they would have to look after.ldquoWe expect most schools to know how many children would fall into the key worker or vulnerable category.He added: ldquoHopefully common sense is beginning to prevail on this issue. The problem is that the guidance has been woolly and ministers have been saying itrsquos up to local authorities.Mr Searson also warned that consideration would have to be given to overhauling arrangements for additional support needspupils in special schools.ldquoStaff and children in these schools need all the protection that can possibly be provided, he said.ldquoThat may mean that, in those schools, we only have one teacher working with a particular group of children, that they create their own bubble.ldquoMaybe we have to move to the point where itrsquos accepted that not all ASN pupils can be in school all of the time.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe have provided guidance for early learning and childcare settings, schools and local authorities on communicating with and reporting to parents during Covid- and supporting parents and pupils with learning at home during Covid-.ldquoWe have invested pound million to address digital exclusion and so far more than , devices have been distributed, and the programme in total is expected to deliver around , devices for disadvantaged children and young people.ldquoThe definition of vulnerable children includes those with additional support needs.

They phoned me back an hour later and said they had seen something.”Joanne, who is a keen sportswoman and coaches netball, continued: “I didnt feel that sick at the time so I continued to play sports and netball. I played a match the following week but I still had the cough and when I came home from the match I began to cough up blood.“Although I contacted Dalriada on call I still didnt feel that sick so I went to bed but when I got up the next day it was worse so I went to AE.“I was admitted to hospital because my lung collapsed and I couldnt breath. I was told I had a carcinoid tumour which is very rare on my left lung and attached to my windpipe.”Throughout lockdown Joanne regularly attended the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for treatment.She said: “I started my chemo and laser surgery and I seemed to spend the whole of lockdown between the Royal and my bed.“In November the consultant told me they had lasered enough of the windpipe to do me over Christmas as they had to free up the hospital due to Covid.“I need an operation to remove a quarter of my windpipe and my left lung with everything being bypassed and directed into my right lung. Once I get the operation the tumour should hopefully be taken all away.”Unfortunately Joanne received news that her operation has been delayed.She said: “I was built up for the operation both physically and mentally. After I was told I went into a depression because they said it would be four months.“I have two or three good days but then the rest are bad and at times I am so ill I have to stay in bed. One minute you are doing  miles an hour and then everything just stops.“But I am very lucky to have the support of my daughters and husband as I know the situation is very hard on them too.”Joanne decided to focus on trying to give something back Action Cancer NI and with the help of her father in law, Raymond Lennox, has been creating bespoke wooden planters, bird feeders, Christmas tress and Christmas plaques.The items are being sold at Blossom and Birch, Broughshane Street in Ballymena, which has hosted a number of events in aid of charity, one of which included a gallery night featuring art work by David McAneaney who also works at the florists.Joanne commented: “Between Raymond and myself we have been making a range of items and there has been a big demand for them. It has been good for us both as it has kept us busy and focused. “It is something to keep your mind off things and it keeps us going.”Despite the impending lockdown Joanne and Raymond hope to continue their fundraising efforts and anyone who is interested in purchasing an item can contact Joanne via her facebook page.

Those who will be aged - by  March  can avail of the jab from over  community pharmacies or through their local GP practice.Health Minister Robin Swann said: “We have seen an increased uptake in the flu vaccine programme this year and whilst this is very encouraging it remains extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the spread of flu.“This is especially true given the very high levels of Covid- transmission in our communities. Reducing the pressure caused by seasonal flu will help protect our health service and save lives.”Minister Swann continued: “This week has also seen GP practices begin the first phase in the Covid- population vaccination programme. Given the scale of the vaccination programme and the delivery schedule of the vaccines it will take time to vaccinate a substantial proportion of the population. I would ask people to remain patient, wait to be called and appreciate that GP practices will be delivering the signicant Covid- programme alongside their normal service. Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of the flu jab, through participating community pharmacies.”Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering the flu programme to date, Minister Swann said: “I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community. I also want to acknowledge the increased role pharmacy teams will play in vaccinating this additional group which will allow GP practices to concentrate on rolling out the Covid- vaccination programme.”The current groups eligible for a free flu vaccination from their GP are now everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , primary school pupils and school children in year  who missed the school vaccination, household contacts of those who received shielding letters and frontline health and social care workers. Free flu vaccination from pharmacies are for everyone aged  to , and frontline health and social care workers.

Under the NI Protocol, companies sending parcels here have to complete customs declarations. While a three-month grace period is in force, it was not announced until shortly before the protocol began to apply at pm last Thursday.But freight boss Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK dismissed a call by North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley that the protocol should be dropped.Other problems including snarl-ups at ports in Great Britain for lorries carrying food to Northern Ireland were discussed at a hearing of the NI Affairs Committee yesterday.Mr Leheny told the committee that one company had  loads of food bound for here which could not be lted by the hauliers because there was no accompanying paperwork. He said a breakdown in communications between government agencies and the industry in Great Britain has helped create delays.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP MP Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP MP Ian PaisleyMany companies there had wrongly believed the grace periods to help the flow of supermarket goods into NI meant no documentation at all was required. However, pre-notications to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsare still required.There is a yawning gap in the knowledge of those in Great Britain exporting to NI, said Mr Leheny.Mr Paisley said that the complications seen in the first few days of the protocol meant that it should be scrapped.A blind man on a galloping horse could have told you this would be a nightmare, he said.But Mr Leheny said there was no realistic alternative. You can#t just walk away and think something  will be better.He added: Industry here did support the backstop but the protocol is where we ended up because every alternative was rejected. The view of our industry is, let#s make it work.But despite reports of delays, a spokesman for the UK Government told the Belfastthe grace periods for supermarkets and their suppliers are working well. Lorries are travelling through NI ports and we continue to work closely with traders as they adapt to these changes.The overwhelming majority of parcels continue to move smoothly, and there is no reason for businesses not to continue to send such goods to NI.The Government is understood to see the three-month grace period from official certication for parcels as a sensible phased solution.However, operators are being urged to carry out movements in compliance with full requirements as soon as they can.The flow of goods is being monitored by HMRC. A Government source said the priority is to have a pragmatic approach that allows us to comply with the protocol without causing undue disruption to businesses and citizens. Crona Clohisey, public policy lead at Chartered Accountants Ireland, urged traders to ensure they have correct documentation, and use the Government#s Trader Support Service for help with the system for moving goods from Great Britain to NI.The reality is that while the UK and EU have concluded a free trade agreement, the NI Protocol brings a whole host of new trading rules to crucially enable frictionless trading on the island of Ireland, she said. Customs declarations are now required when goods are moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland because NI must comply with EU customs and VAT rules at its ports.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Martin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRASnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne Mountains#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest BrexitPost-Brexit premises in Larne ready by autumn#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysExplained: Post-Brexit supermarket link-up in Northern IrelandBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest from Belfast Trump forced to concede through advisers after being locked out of social media‘I want to thank the scientists’: Lionel Blair has second dose of vaccineMass rollout of Oxford vaccine begins in England as hospitals pushed to brinkCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsBM founder pays out another £m idend as Christmas sales soar,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I would believe that employers wishing to do the right thing should accept previous shielding letters as indication that somebody needs to shield until such time as any further communication is resolved.His comments prompted a flurry of anxious responses on social media from members of the public and charities that support vulnerable members of society.However, a spokesman from the Department of Health subsequently issued a statement to clary that the latest advice dfers from the advice that was originally issued to clinically extremely vulnerable people in March last year.It recommended that anyone advised to shield adhere to strict measures, including staying indoors at all times and limiting contact with members of their household.A statement released on Wednesday night said: Prof Young was referring to the updated advice to clinically extremely vulnerable people issued just before Christmas - with a commitment that letters from the chief medical officer would follow. Some of these letters have already been received.While not ato the shielding advice in place in the early part of the pandemic, the updated Northern Ireland advice does mirror the latest advice in England.Sinn Fein MLA Colm Gildernew, chair of the health committee, on Wednesday night described the confusion over the issue as regrettable.It is slightly dferent revised advice and it is regrettable that people who are vulnerable have felt confused and unclear about the advice, he said.According to the latest guidance, clinical extremely vulnerable people should avoid going to shops, pharmacies and hospitality settings. They should also work from home where possible.The measures were put in place on December  but updated information has not yet been sent out to all the , people who were told to shield last June.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland looks set to remain in lockdown until March at the earliest as Prof Young revealed his fears that Covid- will still be out of control at the end of February.Professor Young has given the clearest indication yet that the draconian restrictions put in place to stem the surge in Covid- cases will not come to an end on February .The Executive Office announced on Tuesday that the additional restrictions would be reviewed on January  and will remain in place until February .However, speaking at the health committee on Wednesday, Prof Young said he expects virus levels to remain signicant at the end of February.Prof Young also revealed that a failure to implement the latest lockdown would have resulted in Northern Ireland#s health service being overrun by patients for three months. And he warned that hospitals will experience a surge in patients at the end of the month.It comes as a further , cases and  deaths were announced by the Department of Health on Wednesday.During Wednesday#s committee meeting, Prof Young came under fire from Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan, who said the strategy put in place by Prof Young, Health Minister Robin Swann and chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride to respond to the pandemic had failed miserably.The CSA said: Do I wish we could have done better  Absolutely. Would there be decisions which I could have been taken dferently looking backwards  Without a doubt.When asked to expand further by Mr Sheehan, Prof Young continued: So, I think that right towards the beginning of the epidemic, on a UK-wide and Ireland-wide basis, there might have been some merit in taking action around travel at that stage, before the virus had become very well established in the country, that#s one thing.I think certainly that we would look back and think might have been done dferently although those are policy decisions, they would have been informed by advice.I wish that we had got the testing developed more rapidly and rolled out more rapidly given all the limitations of it because I think more testing earlier in the epidemic would have been very helpful in terms of trying to keep it under control.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Martin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRASnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne Mountains#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsIrish League clubs fear early finish to the season after insisting show must go on despite new lockdownDodds unveils £.m support scheme for hard-hit #wet pubs#Newry Gym owner Trainor accused of Covid breaches facing potential £k fineI#ll not be blocking next month#s transfer test, Education Minister Weir saysLatest from Belfast Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta hopes to find ‘right solution’ regarding Mesut OzilRyanair to operate ‘few,any, flights’ to and from UK and IrelandHeather Knight to lead England in ‘historic’ Pakistan tourTrump forced to concede through advisers after being locked out of social media‘I want to thank the scientists’: Lionel Blair has second dose of vaccine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And children aged  and under are not counted in this total.Speaking to the Belfastdad of five Pol Gallagher said his family has been left bemused.It#s a total mess, making decisions changing decisions, he said. Stormont needs to get these things right. It#s undermining efforts of people trying to abide by what the lockdown restrictions actually are.On Wednesday in the Assembly First Minister Arlene Foster gave an overview of the new restrictions and when referencing the number of people who can gather in a garden Mrs Foster said that the Department of Health was working through the details and there would be clarity to come on the matter.On Wednesday night the NI Direct website was updated with the latest restrictions which remain in place until February  and will be reviewed on January .It also said that everyone must now stay at home unless they had a reasonable excuse.Earlier the head of the police federation Mark Lindsay questioned the practicality of the PSNI being able to enforce the new regulations and whether officers had the power to cross the threshold of a residence.He told the BBC#s Stephen Nolan show: We have been quite disappointed over the past year in some of the legislation that we think has been rushed, hasn#t been properly thought through, and police are left to pick up the pieces.Mr Lindsay said it would be easiertravel restrictions were in place in that officers could tell from someone#s driving licensethey were in breach of regulations.He questioned how is it practical to enforce gatherings in gardens of hundreds of thousands of homes - many of which are inaccessible. However Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs yesterday that officers did have the power of entry.The health protection regulations as laid by the department of health gave those tasked with enforcement the power to take any actions necessary to enforce any legal restrictions and it is the view of the Executive that that includes the right of power of entry, she told MLAs.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRANew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Snowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne Mountains#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsIrish League clubs fear early finish to the season after insisting show must go on despite new lockdownDodds unveils £.m support scheme for hard-hit #wet pubs#Newry Gym owner Trainor accused of Covid breaches facing potential £k fineI#ll not be blocking next month#s transfer test, Education Minister Weir saysLatest from Belfast The conspiracy theories that led to the Capitol being stormed‘Sad milestone’ with more than , Covid- patients in hospitalCash reward offered to track down person dumping cartons of fresh milk on Antrim CoastLadbrokes owner to buy Sweden’s Enlabs for £m as it lts outlookArsenal boss Mikel Arteta hopes to find ‘right solution’ regarding Mesut Ozil,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had actually sent copies of them off to Walt Disney and got a very polite rejection letter but he was very proud of the fact he got a letter with Walt Disney#s signature on the bottom.Terry adored his grandchildren Patrick, Peter, Craig and Rory, and Paul believes he must have dug out some of his old Bubble Fairy stories to tell them when they were young.Paul said Gail used her free time in lockdown to start typing her father#s notes and the family decided to use his most complete stories to use as the basis for The Bubble Fairy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail Hats off to Gail, it was no mean feat, because she#s partially sighted, added Paul. Deciphering my dad#s scribbles in pencil on old pieces of paper was not at all easy for her.She typed it up and we thought we would do a family vanity project for dad.He was obviously published a lot through print journalism but he never got to publish the book, which would have been a thrill for him.My sister just thought to gather everything he had written as best as we can, put it in a book and get it published.The book#s illustrations were drawn by Patrick, who is in his final year of animation at Ulster University. Peter completed the design and layout, Paul was responsible for production and Gail was in charge of editing the final book.Paul said his only regret is that his mother and father didn#t get the chance to see The Bubble Fairy.We#d like to think that he#s up there somewhere and we#ve done him credit, he continued. For it to be a project that involved his own grandchildren, I think that would have blown him away.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTerry Moorhead#s son Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTerry Moorhead#s son Paul The real collaboration was between Patrick and his granddad since it#s their creative input that has made it what it is.My own, Gail#s and Peter#s involvement has been much more mechanical through editing, layout and production.The creative aspect really has spanned the generation from grandfather to grandson.Patrick is the youngest and actually knew my dad least. He describes it as not having memories so much but more memories of memories after seeing videos and hearing stories about him.In a loving tribute, the family also included some photos of Terry with his grandchildren at the end of the book.Only  copies of The Bubble Fairy were printed to give to friends and family for Christmas Day but Paul saidthe feedback is positive then they will consider publishing it on a wider scale.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Martin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRASnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne Mountains#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsMan shot in Derry #paramilitary-style attack#Brandywell hero Willie Curran was a #star on and off pitch#Post-Brexit premises in Larne ready by autumn#Death of commuting will see car sales decline continue#Latest from Belfast ‘I want to thank the scientists’: Lionel Blair has second dose of vaccineMass rollout of Oxford vaccine begins in England as hospitals pushed to brinkCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsBM founder pays out another £m idend as Christmas sales soarPandemic leaves , financial services firms at risk of collapse – FCA,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Just turned, went upstairs.I could hear the noise in the front room, a bag being filled... and he came downstairs and said #look, I have to go#, asthe conversation with my father had terminated.He said to my mother: #Don#t worry, I#ll be back to see you frequently#. And that was the only dissent he ever showed throughout his le until that day. He was on the run, then, basically living in one house or another.Mr McGuinness said he thought it absurd when his brother was appointed as Education Minister, having only attended UCB - University College Bogside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMartin McGuinness FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMartin McGuinness Here#s a guy who had no academic background whatsoever in the formal sense... failed the -plus along with his older brother.How#s he going to handle the situation  But he took charge of a £.bn budget.Mr Paisley, the North Antrim MP, spoke of accepting McGuinness in later years, given that he had considered members of the IRA who killed police officers and bombed cities and towns as people to be absolutely detested.It never left me, the fact who Martin McGuinness was, he said. I wasn#t a fool to this, but someone  once said to me: #What made you do the arrangements with the former terrorist Martin McGuinness #And I said: #The word former#.Julie Hambleton#s sister Maxine was one of  people killed in the IRA Birmingham pub bombings in . She said McGuinness# IRA past could never be justied.When you kill one person you destroy a whole nucleus of a family. The impact of losing Maxine, and for all the families… it#s immeasurable, she said.There is no excuse for Martin McGuinness, or anybody, to pick up a gun or a kne or make a bomb and plant it on innocents.Brid Rodgers, a founding member of the SDLP, said she struggled to forget McGuinness# IRA past when they later became colleagues.She recalled the story of Patsy Gillespie, a Catholic who worked in an Army base. In , considered a collaborator by the IRA, he was forced to drive a van containing ,lbs of explosives to a border checkpoint while his family was held hostage.The bomb killed Mr Gillespie and five soldiers.The documentary is now available to stream online at tg.ie.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRANew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Snowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne Mountains#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsMan shot in Derry #paramilitary-style attack#Brandywell hero Willie Curran was a #star on and off pitch#Post-Brexit premises in Larne ready by autumn#Death of commuting will see car sales decline continue#Latest from Belfast Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta hopes to find ‘right solution’ regarding Mesut OzilRyanair to operate ‘few,any, flights’ to and from UK and IrelandHeather Knight to lead England in ‘historic’ Pakistan tourTrump forced to concede through advisers after being locked out of social media‘I want to thank the scientists’: Lionel Blair has second dose of vaccine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Facilities at Watty Graham GAC, Glen, were damaged on Saturday night after a vehicle was driven onto the main pitch. The club, who experienced a similar incident just two years ago, posted images of the damage on their social media accounts on Sunday morning, branding those responsible as morons. “Yet again our facilities have been damaged by alcohol fuelled morons. Very dficult to understand their mentality. Experience suggests that the culprits didnt travel very far,” the post stated. Some of the damage caused at Watty Grahams GAC, Glen. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Councillor for the area, Brian McGuigan, said the vandalism was an attack on the entire community. “Watty Graham Park is a community facility paid for, maintained and run by the community,” he told the County Derry Post. “I am appalled that the playing surface, maintained all year round by the dedicated volunteers at Watty Graham GAC has been extensively damaged by culprits who not only attacked the GAA facilities but have attacked the entire community. “The club volunteers of Watty Grahams have been working tirelessly alongside community groups within Maghera, helping the elderly and vulnerable during the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “This is a community working together and a community that is angry at the latest act of anti-social activity to blight the area. “It is unbelievable that a person or persons would carry out such a mindless act of vandalism on the community and the facilities. These people need to wise up and get off the communitys back.” Fellow councillor Martin Kearney also condemned the vandalism. “I deplore the recent vandalism to the Watty Grahams Pitch,” he said. “This is not the first time they have been attacked in this way. It is very disappointing when they have served the wider community so faithfully during the ongoing pandemic.     Police appeal A police spokesperson said they were aware of the incident and appealed to anyone with information to come forward. “Police in Magherafelt are appealing for information about criminal damage caused to a football pitch on Falgortrevy Road, Maghera sometime over the weekend,” they said. “It is believed that between pm on Saturdayand pm on Sunday , entry was gained to the grounds of a sports club. “A vehicle is believed to have been driven onto the pitch, performing manoeuvres that caused damage to the grass. “Enquiries are continuing, and we are appealing to anyone with information about this incident to call us on .” Information about the incident can also be passed on to investigating officers through the reporting section on the PNSIs website.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was fully booked and had to turn people away, and people have rebooked, so that means a lot,” she told the County Derry Post. “I didnt really know what I wanted to do until I left school, but I always knew I wanted to work with animals. “I wanted to be a vet, but after a bit of work experience I changed my mind!” googletag.cmd.push Clionas mum Joanne has supported her throughout her move into dog grooming, and said the former St Patricks College, Maghera student had an early introduction to animals. “There have always been animals around her,” she said. “Shes had dogs all her le and used to do horse riding lessons at Laura Browns in Magherafelt. When she was two and a half she asked Santa for a moo, neigh and a quack! “Her uncle built her a stable and Santa brought her a first Shetland pony when she was two and a half.” Dogs have always been part of Clionas le. After leaving school, Cliona completed a Diploma at Wizards of Dogs in Cookstown, where the experience was immersive. googletag.cmd.push “When I was training,a dog comes in that was biting or anything, we had to do it ourselves, to help us learn how to cope when we qualy,” she told the County Derry Post. “That prepared me for going out on my own when you get dogs like that you know how to deal with it. You just try your best to work with them and find a way that works better than what youve tried. “I couldnt have done it without the Wizard of Dogs, Ive learned so much. You do your first aid and start off grooming two dogs a day.     “By the end it was loads more, and I covered all the dferent cuts, so I got plenty of experience there,” she added. While dog groomers have been able to remain open throughout the latest raft of Covid- restrictions, Clionas sister, Nicole, hasnt been so lucky. “Her sister has a salon in Maghera and we were laughing that Cliona has only started and she can stay open whereas Nicole has to close,” explained Joanne. “We could maybe get her an odd dog to bath.” You can follow Fairy Tail Dog Grooming by visiting their Facebook and Instagram pages.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways. Trauma basically makes the whole world unsafe for you and you donrsquot know where the next incident will come from.Support and information are available at www.womensaidni.org including information on the local centres covering all of Northern IrelandTo contact police, call the non-emergency lsquorsquo number or call lsquorsquo in an emergency.

His later pledge of an Irish Sea border “over his dead body” is already shown to be rubbish.Brandon Lewis on radio yesterday repeated the old line that it was only an extension of existing “phytosanitary checks”.It is not — it is now a major economic barrier in the Irish Sea, and we have been reporting on its major consequences daily. It is a betrayal of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK by the prime minister, now given cover by Michael Gove.Dublin was slavishly loyal to the EU and gave no succour to London at all in EU talks. Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance wanted rigorous implementation of the protocol , and they have got it.It is welcome that businessmen such as the freight transport boss Mark Cosgrove, the UUP MLA John Stewart and yesterday the DUP MP Ian Paisley Junior are now calling for Article  to be applied. Mr Paisley, however, chased a soft target, Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK .While it is appalling that all the business groups supported the backstop, and its idea that the Irish land border above all had to be completely open, the key culprit in the economic detachment of Northern Ireland from Great Britain is this supposed Conservative and Unionist government.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

About  Hong Kong pro-democracy figures were arrested by police on Wednesday under a national security law In the largest ever single arrest, over  pro – democracy legislators and activists were arrested and charged for subversion under the draconian National Security Law which had been imposed in July  on Hong Kong by Beijing. These laws override Hong Kong laws and judicial independence effectively ending Hong Kong’s autonomy. Freedom of speech, human rights, and the right to political dissent were early casualties. Among those arrested were former legislators, such as Lam Cheuk-ting, Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, Claudia Mo, James To, Gwyneth Ho, Alvin Yeung and Leung Kwok-Hung. Other people arrested were Professor of Law, Benny Tai, and American human rights lawyer, John Clancey.The alleged pretext for the arrest of all these champions for democracy was that they had dared to campaign and make preparations for securing the election of a majority of pro-democracy legislators on Hong Kong’s Legislative Council which had been due to be held in September . However, because such a prospect looked likely at the time, the elections were postponed for a year by the Hong Kong government.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...These arrests had been preceded in December  by the jailing of leaders of the democracy protest movement, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam followed by the arrest of Hong Kong media tycoon, Jimmy Lai, who is the owner of the Hong Kong newspaper, Apple Daily, and approximately thirty others who were all charged with breaching the National Security Law and who are being detained without any real prospect of being released on bail.China’s objective in all its actions is that after having effectively stripped Hong Kong’s Legislative Council of any democratic legitimacy, it has now turned its attention to crippling and destroying the Democracy Protest movement.Because the international community has been largely distracted by the Covid  crisis, the controversial U. S. Presidential election and the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, there has been an insufficient and uncoordinated response to China’s unacceptable behaviour by the major powers. Another factor has been that some of these countries also prefer to give priority to their short-sighted trading interests with China over their commitment to universal human rights values in light of the plight of Hong Kong citizens, and indeed their own long-term economic interests. This has to change before it is too late.With the Brexit negotiations having concluded and the US Presidential election also close to reaching finality, the Irish Government is now in a unique position to help change things. The opportunity is presented by the fact that on January st we took up our seat on the UN Security Council. When we secured election to this prestigious post in June , the then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, promised that “we will use our presence to advance the causes we have championed – peace and security, conflict resolution, reconciliation……” Membership of the Security Council includes countries such as the UK and China who were co-signatories to the Sino- British treaty which established the “one country two systems” in Hong Kong. It also includes the United States soon to be led by our Presidential “friend of Ireland”. Furthermore, under the UN Charter “Chapter  the role of the Security Council includes among other things:-The UN Security Council are authorised to investigate a dispute which may lead to an international friction, or is likely to endanger international peace and security.Should a dispute endanger international peace or security, the UN Security Council may recommend terms of settlement of the disputeNow is an opportune time to put our credentials to the test by persuading our fellow members of the UN Security Council to explore these two options.John Cushnahan, Former Alliance Party leader, Fine Gael MEP and European Parliament Rapporteur on Hong Kong from  to "},{"url":null,"title":"new irish sea border worrying we need deal reality and be positive and try minimise harm caused barrier ","story":"South East Antrim UDA issue threat against Arlene Foster say PSNI   Irish Sea border which Secretary of State Brandon Lewis claims doesn’t exist empties shelves and ends business in Northern IrelandNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutChristmasCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingPuzzlesChristmasPublic NoticesNewsOpinionThe new Irish Sea border is worrying but we need to deal with reality and be positive and try to minimise the harm caused by the barrierA letter from John Gemmell:By John GemmellWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  \"The present Taoiseach Micheal Martin seems reasonable, though the bar was not set high by his predecessor, writes John Gemmell.

Sinn Fein longed for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, the SNP too. Chaos is their natural constituency. Instead, we have ato order after a five-year long national psychodrama.The prime minister is now in ‘levelling up’ mode, just what we need. Interventionism is winning, not free-market mayhem. We can expect to see massive infrastructural investment, and investment support for businesses.Even a new foreign policy is emerging, recognising the importance of new diplomatic networks, as well as new trade deals. We have many friends. A few of them are more precious, and many of them more steady, than some of our immediate neighbours.Sir Keir Starmer has rightly moved on from Brexit to argue for national renewal, saying now is not the time for a second Scottish independence referendum. We must reform the constitution first. He appears unafraid of the word ‘federalism’ in a UK context.Lastly, the present Taoiseach seems reasonable, though the bar was not set high by his predecessor. We can do business with him, but not via his Shared Island Unit, I would suggest.We have done ourselves immense damage since .

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Whatever reason members have for being there, the council officers should work with those members to assist them.”However, DUP Councillor, Nathan Anderson, took issue with the comments branding them “unfair”, pointing out that six members from the committee attended the meeting from the chamber.“We are in fulfillment of the guidance because we are key workers and we are very clear on that,” Cllr Anderson said.“We are within the rules and there has also been a risk assessment done. Some people may not feel that it is OK to do your democractic duty and speak but some people do.“Members have to be aware that democracy is very important and the ability for us as elected members to represent our constituencies always takes priority, some might not want to do that. It is unfair to criticise members for doing their duty.”Councillor Paul Porter, who also attended the meeting online, said Cllr Gregg’s comments were ‘dficult to understand’ considering the current circumstances.He said: “We all have our own issues and I think it rather disappointing that Councillor Gregg for whatever reason thought this was the best way to raise this point.“Some people who work might not have time to head home and the easiest way for them to attend the meeting and do their duty is to come into the chamber. Everybody is trying their best and I thought it rather disappointing to be lectured when we are all trying our best.”However, Councillor Gregg refuted the allegation saying he wasn’t “questioning anybody’s right to speak”.Raising a point of order, Councillor Gregg added: “You were calling me out saying that I was criticizing or trying to compromise democracy which was a ridiculous statement.”The committee chairman took note of the Cllr Gregg’s point of order before moving on.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularIrish Sea border which Secretary of State Brandon Lewis claims doesn’t exist empties shelves and ends business in Northern IrelandLIVE UPDATES: Coronavirus NI - Massive Covid- spike in ROI as almost , new infections and  deaths in  hours - ‘Ludicrous’ that transfer test may proceed while GCSEs and A-levels cancelled - ‘In the name of God, go’ - Mike Nesbitt quotes Oliver Cromwell and calls for Education Minister Peter Weir to resignPSNI given power to fine people £away from home without reasonable excuseNI public ORDERED to stay at home - legally enforceable from FridayNI Snow Alert - Met Office issues yellow status snow and ice warning - Glenshane Pass will be affectedMost PopularDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and are replaced with Spar brandLong sets out exact new rules on exercise – possible £k fines await lawbreakersSammy Wilson confronts Boris Johnson over new restrictions - ‘the first two lockdowns didn’t work, are you hoping for third time lucky ’ dies after ‘serious’ two vehicle collision\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.newsletter news transport co-down-road-cosed-after-two-vehicle-collision-ersions-place-motorists- itm_sourceparsely-api\" dies after ‘serious’ two vehicle collision\"Elderly womandies after ‘serious’ two vehicle collisionPSNI warn against new COVID- phishing text message                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-lhVmIH sc-bYSBpT cqvPrG\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutChristmasCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlesCoronavirusGetting outMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

And we donrsquot want to give coronavirus to our close family or friends.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people must show \"extreme caution\" during the Christmas period and consider whether it is wise to mix with families, and particularly elderly and vulnerable family members.He said that it had been \"unanimously agreed\" among the four UK nations that the approved relaxation of restrictions should remain, as \"we dont want to criminalise peoples long-made plans\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

As at the beginning of the Covid- outbreak, these changes will allow Translink to focus their efforts on providing travel for key workers and ensure that people have access to essential services. However, I can assure the public that no geographical area is losing services and people will continue to be able to practice social distancing on our public transport network. “My priority as always is keeping our communities safe and my Department is doing everything it can to ensure essential services and connections are maintained for those using and reliant on our infrastructure network. I will keep the public transport situation under constant review in line with the public health advice. “As we enter a further period of enhanced restrictions, I am asking for your support and would ask everyone only to traveltheir journey is essential.
