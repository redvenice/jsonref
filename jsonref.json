The decision to regroup under a new banner could help them catch up Stem is flourishing, but it is a cause for concern that other subjects on the tree of knowledge are in less good shape. Falling numbers of English graduates will soon coincide with a baby bulge just hitting secondary schools, which over the next decade will need 50,000 more teachers, especially in core subjects the Black Lives Matter protests underscored our thoroughgoing incomprehension of our history.But besides such practical issues is the larger question of what a good life is. This week, a group spearheaded by the British Academy and including the London School of Economics and Arts Council England offered their answer: a parallel acronym, Shape – social sciences, humanities and the arts for people and the economy. So everything from fine art to psychology to economics: the disciplines that help us govern ourselves, understand how we have developed over time and argue for doing it all better.Shape subjects will also be central to answering the most urgent questions we face science, for instance, is foundational to comprehending the climate emergency, but will not effect the political and behavioural changes needed to achieve net zero. Nor will it necessarily predict or mould the future. Eric Hobsbawm may have found it baffling that “brilliant fashion designers … sometimes succeed in anticipating the shape of things to come better than professional predictors” the fact remains they sometimes can. The stem of a plant is, after all, sustained and not just decorated by its leaves.We should not be shy to argue for confidence and curiosity, joy and openness as good in themselves. Along with Stem, Shape subjects have the potential to open up the full extent of our humanity, to help shape a well-rounded, empathetic and resilient body politic. Fighting for equal weighting for these disciplines is not only good but also necessary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

The regulator is not directly responsible for exam issues. The school said it was “cooperating fully” with the body.Meanwhile, Ucas said that it had reminded the school of its guidelines after it was made aware of the school’s approach to predicted grades. This was understood to have been before the  report.The school documents seen by the  say that predictions for the international baccalaureate (IB) exams, which the school uses instead of A-levels, may be increased “to facilitate an application to a more selective universitycourse”. But the Ucas guidelines say that “predicted grades should be set in isolation of an applicant’s university or college choice(s)”.After the  story was published, parents and alumni received a letter from the acting headteacher, Theresa Homewood, seeking to reassure them over the school’s approach to predicted grades.While it did not dispute the details of the documents it said it wanted to “ensure there is no confusion as to our approach and processes”, and that the school “refutes any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate Ucas predictions”.But on Thursday it amended its position and indicated that it had inadvertently provided an incorrect figure, meaning it could not say that its predictions significantly outperformed national comparators that year. The school later apologised to parents for the error, which it said was “an honest mistake which we thought was correct at the time and was identified by us not a third party”.Amid warnings from academics and former teachers that such issues were commonplace in the private school sector, the Department for Education was also critical of the approach and warned: “Schools should not be inflating predicted grades … If this is not the case in any school, we expect them to change their policies.”The IB organisation, which regulates a separate set of predictions used to help set grade boundaries and not usually a part of university admissions, said it had examined the last five years of predictions and “confirms that all of these are in line with the … results achieved”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1079a034723f56d8dc613972fc323d669ae89074/0_0_3014_2009/master/3014.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e390fe1f3f5df9649e94c972b741ddd 700w","title":"share your best and worst lockdown baking experiences","story":"Have you been baking up a storm during the pandemic?

Right, you’ve won the league for the first time in 30 years on a baking summer’s evening: now everybody, stay at home! And of course, most did. They’re the ones you probably didn’t see. They stayed at home in Kinshasa and Kuala Lumpur, in Malmö and Manhattan, in Wallasey and West Derby. They gathered in WhatsApp groups and Zoom watchalongs and sat in their living rooms and bedrooms, quietly savouring.Meanwhile, a few went out. They’re the ones you probably did see: the ones waving their red smoke canisters, holding up their replica Premier League trophies, tooting their horns. In recent weeks there was a strange pseudo-debate over the prospect of Liverpool fans descending on Anfield to celebrate their title win. On one side we were presented with the idea of football fan as brainless beefcake, drawn irrevocably to revelry like a fly to shit. On the other, the football fan as noble and pious martyr, whose intrinsic virtue must never be questioned, let alone impugned.Perhaps it ultimately should have surprised nobody that football fans are neither superior people, nor inferior people, but simply people. In moments of triumph or moments of trauma, football offers something we all need from somewhere: shared pride, a common emotional canvas, a sense of belonging at a time when we have scarcely felt more apart from each other. Winning your first championship since 1990, an achievement that for many will have been a lifelong consumption: is the urge to seek out human companionship at a moment like this really so strange?Of course, at most clubs, “30 years of hurt” that also generated 14 major trophies – including two Champions Leagues – is the sort of drought fans would happily sign up for. Yet Liverpool has never judged itself by the standards of most clubs, or indeed by the standards of most cities. Partly this is a question of geography, partly a question of culture, partly a question of politics. A proud port town that has traditionally looked outwards to the high seas, rather than inwards to its own country, for inspiration and kinship. You didn’t need to be a Militant-voting, flag-waving scouse separatist to feel the disconnect. The sense that England was some other place, over there, and that on some level the feeling was entirely mutual.The unashamed exceptionalism that has fuelled some of Liverpool’s proudest achievements as a city has also turned it into a target. It’s 16 years since the infamous Spectator leader that chided the people of Liverpool for wallowing in their “victim status”, for “an excessive predilection for welfarism”, for refusing to “accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes”. And yet to this day, trawl through online forums or read social media or listen to chants by rival fans, and you will hear those very same tropes rehashed in one form or another. The editor who published the article, meanwhile, just so happens to be the prime minister.And so with the possible exception of Manchester United, there is no other club in English football in whom rival fans are more emotionally invested, no club whose failures and calamities are more eagerly awaited or celebrated. The unbridled glee with which many fans still celebrate their title collapse in 2014 – Demba Ba, Stevie Gerrard, that slip, that song – is hard to imagine ever being replicated for, say, Chelsea or Tottenham or Manchester City.Perhaps inevitably, Liverpool’s modern narrative has been built on resistance, of overcoming the odds, of taking on greater powers: whether over Hillsborough, or the tide of new money that transformed English football in the early 2000s, or even in protesting against their own owners. Above all, they have been railing against the idea that this is a place with more past than future, that their golden era has gone for good. That hurricane of rage, of irresistible just cause, has fuelled some of their greatest triumphs on a football pitch: Olympiakos 2004, West Ham 2006, Barcelona 2019. But over a gruelling 38-game season, it has more often proved a millstone.The crowning achievement of Jürgen Klopp, therefore, has been to overcome the challenge that has ultimately sunk every one of his predecessors: to block out the noise. To set history to one side. To shout down the cynics and the doubters with a new and unanswerable cry of their own. There is a widespread perception of Klopp’s team as an essentially emotional vehicle: one fuelled by passion and fervour and the irresistible Anfield roar. In fact, this season Liverpool’s football is more accurately defined as the pursuit of immaculate, imperial control: an ordered, structured unit built on rock-solid defence, relentless pressing, endlessly rehearsed patterns of play, an even temper. Half of their 28 wins have been by a single goal: the highest proportion of any champions since Leicester in 2016.In order to make history, first Liverpool had to let it go. It’s tempting to spy parallels between the Liverpool of the 1980s – a city scarred by discord and decay – and the Liverpool of 2020, a city labouring under a decade of austerity, whose finances are in their worst state since the second world war, according to the mayor, Joe Anderson.But at the very least, the red half of Liverpool will cherish this rare moment of communion: one of those times when everything else seems to fall silent, and all you can hear is singing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90860fea67a63ad6d0f6f0394d075bba3b4a8e6/0_280_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6c96d5c154eb859783ee2556a6c83fa","title":"experience my yoga class turned out to be a cult","story":"After a few months, I realised I wasn’t seeing my friends and family as much as I used to. The organisation didn’t like itI was 22 when I moved to a different US city and needed a new yoga studio. I discovered a place that believed in eastern mysticism – perfect for an open-minded spiritualist, which was how I saw myself at the time.I walked in and a young woman was very excited to see me. She paid attention to my every word, making me feel cared about. I then met with a “master”, who informed me I was in very poor energetic health and needed to sign up right away. The classes were quirky. We’d do 40 minutes of exercise and meditation to a mix of new age flute music and Michael Jackson. It was far less pretentious than the yoga studios I had visited before. I decided to join for the haggled price of $100 (£79) a month.During my second class, the teacher gave me a healing massage, rubbing my chest with both hands. I started to cry. A friend had killed herself a few weeks before and I was probably more emotionally raw than I realised.As I got better at yoga, the masters told me I had potential. Within a month, my master had personally requested that I attend a weekend retreat the organisation was hosting in the Arizona desert, where about 400 people spent time doing yoga. I’d have to pay my airfare, plus fees to the organisation.The retreat was fancy: lots of rich Californians in a huge house with a pool, gardens and many outhouses. We were well fed. I made close friends from around the world, forging deep bonds with other members, some sexually charged. I had a good time.After that, I attended two more retreats. At one, the leader addressed the crowd in the manner of a minister giving a sermon. (There was even a special chair that only he could sit on.) Before he was introduced on the opening night, the crowd was whipped into a frenzy as loud dance music played a rock star entrance.During that third event, senior devotees tried to convince me to become a “healer”, their term for someone who teaches classes. They said, “Do you want to save the world? Make that happen by teaching.” By then I’d sacrificed time and money for the group, and made friends. I had reservations, but was too embarrassed to turn back. I paid several thousand dollars to train, maxing out my credit cards.Healers are a step below masters who are similar to monks, living in small apartments with other masters and turning over most of their possessions. A close friend who joined around the time I did quit university and spent tens of thousands of dollars from her student loan fund to become a loyal master.After a few months’ training, I realised I wasn’t seeing my friends and family as much as I used to. The organisation didn’t like it if I went on a weekend away with friends. I thought about leaving, but had already paid a year’s subscription and for more Arizona trips. I figured I’d stay and gain from the experience.As time went on, I struggled. I started reading online accounts of others who felt exploited by the group. I wasn’t falling in line, either. Once, a master grabbed me by the shoulders, shouted in my face and shook me, because I wasn’t doing what they wanted. I was supposed to be an obedient subject.The tipping point was when I was told I should leave behind my “unconscious family” (my parents), as my “spiritual family” (the organisation) was more important. One master hadn’t spoken to his parents for five years. It was tough, he told me, but said that saving the world was far more important. I know he believed he was doing the right thing. He was just fully indoctrinated.I spent six months with the organisation. I didn’t want to be convinced to stay, so when I left I basically ghosted everyone. I still felt I owed them an explanation, though. In the end, I sent them a postcard, saying, “Good luck on your path, but this is not my path.” They never wrote back.The only time I saw anyone from there again was a decade later, on the front page of a magazine. The article described the organisation as a cult, outlining its brainwashing tactics and speaking to several former members I knew. From some of their stories, I’m glad I got out when I did. • As told to Jack NeedhamDo you have an experience to share?

Share your experience in the comment sectionEver since my gym teacher stood, arms folded, laughing at my inability as a four-year-old to tuck myself into a ball and perform a somersault, exercise has been a foreign concept.Team sports were an orgy of disappointment – of realizing I was the weak link leading us to yet another defeat – while inidual endeavors were equally dispiriting. Running made me feel like my lungs were about to explode, I never learned to ride a bike, and swimming made me realize you could sweat underwater and almost drown in the shallow end of the pool.Pre-lockdown, my body was a willing receptacle for pints of beer, cigarettes and sandwiches. My body had become this doughy thing I carried around with me. The only interaction I had with my physical self was the realization that my skin is brown - a fact that set me apart from my largely white social circle. It was something I came to define myself by.When the coronavirus pandemic hit and we were all placed in lockdown, I thought it would be business as usual hours sat at my desk, punctuated by eating, with the added bonus of working from my kitchen where my fridge was in reach. Living alone, though, the lack of human contact soon became punishingly apparent, especially when it came to seeing my best friend.Normally we would see each other at least once a week but now I didn’t know when that would happen again. For him, the outside world had become truly treacherous because he is immunocompromised. Perhaps due to his powerlessness against an invisible threat, he started exercising from home, and the results were immediately apparent. On our weekly video calls I could see him bulking up, filling the picture frame increasingly each time. Each time he would try and convince me to workout with him.Eventually I relented, mainly out of boredom. I balanced my phone on the kitchen table and we started doing pushups, sit-ups and jumping jacks over video call. It was excruciating. Those familiar feelings of exhaustion and inadequacy bubbled to the surface, telling me to quit. Yet, glancing up at the screen and seeing my friend, miles away, sweating with me and cheering me on, it was just enough to keep me going.Soon we were having video call workout sessions at least every other day. I thought I was doing a selfless act, giving him a sense of structure while he was stuck at home, yet a month into our regime I realized I was the one looking forward to the workouts. I was starting to notice myself in the mirror and not feel apathetic about what I saw – I was even enjoying the process that had gotten me there. On one particularly humid afternoon we dragged ourselves through an hour of 1,000 reps, and that familiar exhaustion became something to savor – a badge of honor rather than an aftertaste of failure.Working out had become a vital lifeline to my friend, empowering him in the face of an anxiety-inducing virus. But it had also allowed me to feel embodied for the first time in my life. Exercise had stopped being a vain activity I had condescendingly convinced myself I was above.

I was totally inspired. Jean and I had just fallen in love and we were all loved up, among all those bands and millions of people … I’d never seen a hippy in my life before – the boys and girls all looked the same! From that, I was determined to do an event of my own. I had a better site, facing Glastonbury Tor in the vale of Avalon – it was all a bit romantic.“So I phoned the Kinks and booked them for £500. My favourite band coming to the farm! It was an amazing feeling. Then there was a story in Melody Maker that said: ‘Kinks for mini-festival’. The band didn’t like that: they were No 1 across the world, why were they doing a “mini festival”? So they pulled out. I’d already sold 100 tickets, so I felt very guilty. But the same agent said his mates had got T.Rex going down to Minehead Butlins, which is on the route. They did it for the same 500 quid. So I was saved by Marc Bolan, really.”“I attracted quite a lot of trendy hippies,” Eavis says. Two of them were Arabella Churchill and Andrew Kerr, who had read John Michell’s 1969 book The New View Over Atlantis, “which had Glastonbury as the new Jerusalem – he wrote about leylines and all sorts of silly things. A lovely fellow: an Etonian, old-school British with a stiff upper lip, but also a hippy. Andrew and Arabella put the two together: Michell’s book and my farm.” They worked together on a free festival, with David Bowie, Joan Baez and more. “Arabella and Andrew ran out of money so I had to carry the can for it in the end. I was getting more and more worse off.”Eavis hosted free festivals on the farm throughout the 1970s. “The police were bringing all the waifs and strays off the side of the road and into my place as somewhere to dump them, and I didn’t seem to mind, so we had a party every year.” He started the festival up officially again in 1979. “We ran out of money and had to go to the bank to get £15,000 to see that one through,” he says. The bank now had the deeds to the farm, and it would be theirs if he kept losing money. “But I was keen to carry on.”Eavis steadied the ship by joining forces with the anti-nuclear campaigners CND, initially naming the festival after the organisation. “They picked up 300,000 posters and stuffed them into envelopes, so people suddenly knew who we were. We took the costs, CND took the balance, and they ended up with £20,000, a fortune in those days.”Eavis calls this one of his favourite years, for the performances by Jackson Browne and Van Morrison, but also for the growing scale. “Sixty thousand people turned up to that – we were looking at fives and 10s before. The CND thing helped, and I attracted a lot of people who were anti-Thatcher, so I’ve got Maggie to thank for our success in a way. We had out-of-work miners working on the security fence, from Maggie closing down the mines.”The NME’s review of Glasto 83 is wonderfully snooty – the crowd are regarded as “sun-soaking slabs of human tripe” – but even they were entranced by Mayfield: “It took one song from this wondrous man to discover the unearthed treasures of the Pyramid.” One of the most incongruous fashion choices in Glastonbury history came when Paul Weller performed with the Style Council amid mud in a bright white suit. “It seemed a bit at odds anyway, a band like us doing Glasto,” Weller tells me. “There was a post-apocalyptic fashion look, a lot of anarchists. It was just a mudbath, like something out of the first world war, and I had to resort to wellies. We felt out of our depth, so we got straight on the Pernod. By the time we went on I was completely gone. I realised I couldn’t play properly, so I put my guitar down and just sang instead. All the anarchists down the front were chucking mud, but because I was even more out of it than the audience was, I think we won them over. We played Long Hot Summer, which was really taking the piss – it was pouring down with rain – but everyone seemed to see the funny side of it, and it ended up all right. The suit was fucked up, though.”Dedicated to esoteric therapies, the healing fields opened in the mid-80s and are still going strong. In 2019, the  spoke to a couple of gong bath practitioners who had managed to see just one music performance in 15 years.Backed by the then home secretary Michael Heseltine, the police cracked down violently on travellers who organised a free festival each year at Stonehenge, in a confrontation that was later called the Battle of the Beanfield. Eavis gave the travellers refuge as they fled west. “I put them in the field next door and they ran their own thing, with their own music. And it was free, even though I was doing a paying event on my farm. You had all these lovely posh girls from Hampstead coming down, and they all ploughed off to the hippy festival next door.“I quite enjoyed the hippies’ music and they did make me laugh,” he says. “I was just a dairy farmer, but I thought of them as friends. Being a dairy farmer in Somerset, milking and calving cows, some people do get depressed and kill themselves – it’s quite a lonely life, really. So this was an excitement that I’d imported, and they came on board and added a bit of extra spice to it. I was doing the Cure, Elvis Costello and stuff – and they came up with a new dimension in their music.”Those hippies turned out to be extraordinarily creative, and have come to define Glastonbury’s aesthetic. You can see it in the flame-belching creations of Arcadia or the cyberpunk shanty town of Shangri-La, but a large part is down to Mutoid Waste Company, who kicked off in 1987 with their Carhenge installation.Named by Rolling Stone as one of the 50 greatest concerts of the past 50 years, this headline show featured just two songs: CBB and Teacher Don’t Teach Me Nonsense. But what songs. Fela delivered solos on percussion, soprano sax and organ between statesmanlike vocal addresses, all over that inimitably tripping, rolling beat.The cordiality with the crusties dissolved in spectacular fashion. “They were selling too many drugs for my liking,” Eavis says. “I got a security firm from Wolverhampton who were all judo gold medallists, and they confiscated all their drugs. It got nasty in the end.” His daughter and now co-organiser Emily Eavis tells me she remembers “people running past the window with molotov cocktails and burning telegraph poles and blowing up Land Rovers. The fact we’re still here is miraculous.”“But all those people still work for me now, you know,” Michael continues. “They’re a very clever, creative crowd – never got proper jobs – and the things they build every year are unbelievable. And they get paid now – they weren’t paid in the mid-80s. So they’re a lot happier.”Every Glastonbury-goer will find themselves suddenly agog at a daredevil circus act, and the peak for this kind of eccentric performance was the French troupe Archaos in 1990. While they weren’t allowed to do some of their more outré material involving chainsaws and motorbikes, they still wowed with high-wire and trapeze from their base high up at the apex of the Pyramid stage.This festival-friendly addition to the megalithic structures that dot this part of the west of England is technically called the Swan Circle. Its designer, Ivan McBeth, conceived it while living on the Glastonbury site in a portable geodesic dome. “As the full moon rose over King’s Hill, my inspiration arrived,” he writes. “I was to build a stone temple whose prominent stones represented the major stars of the constellation Cygnus, the Swan. I experimented with my star map. It was not possible to make a circle of stones given the positions of the stars, but an egg would fit.” Anyone visiting his ovoid temple, “consciously or unconsciously, will be irrevocably changed by their interaction with spirit. Every year tens of thousands of people – pilgrims all – enter the Swan stone circle and fly on her back through Dreamtime, and experience transformation. Yo!” To be honest, flying on a swan through Dreamtime is positively vanilla compared with some of the stuff that goes on here at 5am on Monday morning.Rave culture reached Glastonbury with this epic dance happening. “It was the first dance field, where Shangri-La is now,” remembers Underworld’s Karl Hyde. “We set up on a two-storey tower in the middle of the field surrounded by a quadraphonic Funktion-One sound system – over two nights, DJs, live musicians and visual artists jammed, only stopping at the point we got taken over by a hardcore rave crew who, thankfully, got booed off by our crowd. Eight thousand people turned up to the last night, when we collectively played for 18 hours straight. By the time they asked us back, we were headlining the Other Stage.”The hippy-heavy crowd at Glastonbury were in thrall to the Levellers: swelled by gatecrashers, this is possibly the biggest-ever Glastonbury headliner crowd, estimated at 300,000 people. “Because it’s dark, you can’t actually see the crowd,” singer Mark Chadwick later said. “Except when they put the lights up between songs, and they look like a field of ploughed potatoes.”The BBC has long had the TV rights to Glastonbury, but it was Channel 4 that first broadcast from the festival, helping it go from hippy curiosity to British cultural heavyweight. An enterprising YouTuber has uploaded VHS-taped coverage, complete with sax-backed Tampax ads.“Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.” With those words, as ever, Cash launched into Folsom Prison Blues and cemented the Glastonbury tradition for legends to play on a Sunday afternoon. “I’ve seen a lot of people who are not like me,” he said in an on-site interview. “That’s all right. Everybody’s got the God-given right to be who they wanna be.” As good a maxim for Glastonbury as any.Having recently left Take That, Robbie Williams turned up to the festival with Oasis for the year that Britpop reached its zenith. Emily had just done her GCSEs and, in typical teenager fashion, was camping out in the fields well away from her parents. “We’d never really had a pop star here before, and there was such a buzz about Oasis too. It felt like a turning point in the festival’s history we captured what was happening in the outside world, culturally and musically.”Drafted into a headline slot after the Stone Roses pulled out due to John Squire breaking his collarbone, Pulp seized their moment and became pop stars with a common touch. “If a lanky get like me can do it, you can do it too,” Jarvis Cocker told the crowd. Emily calls it “one of my real musical turning points – when you’re 15 and standing in a field and watching those bands that mean so much to you, that was Pulp for me. It was a storming, incredible set.”Thanks to what was diplomatically described as “an unfortunate operational error”, the dance tent was flooded in gallons of excrement after the machine that was meant to be sucking up excess water did exactly the opposite. In perhaps the worst year for mud and rain ever, Radiohead hoisted the audience off the soaking ground. “A moment of transcendence: when it becomes something greater than a gig in a field, and turns into something that people talk about for a long time after,” Emily says. “It had this almighty resonance. People were probably feeling a bit stranded – it was Friday night and they had two more days of these extreme conditions tents were already sliding downhill. But this band came on and spoke to them.” Their monitors stopped working, so while it sounded great in the crowd, they couldn’t hear themselves playing. “There was a deep connection with the crowd, because both sides were vulnerable,” Emily says.Guitarist Ed O’Brien recalls: “It was the biggest gig we had ever done and would ever do for years. We were in flight-or-fight mode during the show itself as the monitors weren’t working. It was so emotionally charged up on stage that night and it wasn’t until Thom asked Andi our lighting director, to switch on the lights that we were finally able to get an idea of the sheer size of it. That was the only moment of euphoria. We thought we’d blown it when we walked offstage. But something happened that night.”Just one month before the festival, Jean Eavis died of cancer, aged 60. Michael and Emily led a memorial event during the festival, where a phoenix was burned with a brass acorn inside, and an oak tree was planted where it fell. “We were in a very delicate state,” she says. “But even though it was a sad year it was a real celebration of her life. The festival was due to end in 2000, but the amount of support we had made us think we could keep it going.“In the early days of the festival, it was very unpredictable and wild – every time you walked out there might be a pagan on the doorstep who’d had some kind of brainwave. A melting pot of people, and my mum was the anchor. She even held my dad down – he needed a bit of grounding because he got overexcited, running away with things. Back in the 80s, there were a lot of drug casualties because there were a lot more dealers on site, so after welfare had gone home, my mum would look after them. There would often be people there when I got home from school – she’d be giving them sweet tea, and wrapping them up in blankets. And then parents would call and ask us if we had their children – she would drop them off back to where they needed to go.”“Bowie’s agent, John Giddings, phoned me and said David wanted to play,” Michael says. “So I said: ‘What’s he doing now, can we listen to the stuff he’s playing?’ He was doing a show in Manchester Arena, so I took the kids up. We walked into the box in the arena, and people started cheering below, and I thought: ‘My God, how do they know who we are?’ Turns out Eric Cantona was just behind me. I didn’t really like the show – it was a very experimental stage in his life and he was all over the place. We didn’t know a single song. I thought: ‘What’s the point of going with this?’ I phoned John back and said: ‘Can’t he play some songs we know?’ So he said: ‘We’ll do another show in London for you, then, of all his hits.’ And we loved it – it was so good. I told John I could afford £90,000. John said: ‘Is that all? How are we going to tell David?’ Well, that’s your job, John. And it was a done deal. The whole crowd went crazy on it – it was a wonderful show.”This was a truly feral year, with gatecrashers in record numbers. “I wasn’t prepared,” Michael says. “The fence wasn’t good enough, the security was crap. So I was hauled over the coals by the police, who said: ‘You’ve got to get someone to organise your show. You’re a nice bloke and all that, but you couldn’t arrange something in a brewery, you know the saying?’ I said: ‘Fair enough. At least I can be guaranteed to get 150,000 people at the drop of a hat – I did get the knack of that!’” He hired Reading and Leeds promoter Melvin Benn to sort the operational side. “He used to work for me in the 80s I’d trained him up, in a way. Bless his heart, he convinced the police he could make it a lot better.”“I then had their agents saying the band weren’t ready for it: ‘Can’t they go on in the middle of the afternoon?’ No, they’re headlining. I thought these people were controlling his life, saying they weren’t fit for it. And they were fit for it, and did a wonderful job. And they went from strength to strength after that.”By pairing Hunter wellies with tiny shorts, Kate Moss invents the definitive British festival look – even for men – that is still going strong today.One of the hottest, most enthusiastically queued-for experiences in Glastonbury opens, an ultra-sweaty den of drag, disco and debauchery. “I was there at 5am last year, and I had never seen scenes like this in my life,” Emily says. “An incredible club in New York full of drag queens dancing all night: can this really be happening on Worthy Farm?”Glastonbury already had a Mad-Max-on-perry vibe about it, but was massively enhanced by the arrival of Arcadia. The collective’s Afterburner installation made it debut in 2007 and gradually grew legs and became a 50-tonne spider. “Anatomically, it was very incorrect – real spiders don’t have built-in fire cannons,” its creator, Pip Rush, brother of Mutoid Waste Company’s Joe, told the  last year. In 2019, it was replaced by a fire-breathing crane rescued from Bristol’s docks.The best views, the best secret sets – the Park stage is now a much-cherished gem. “We got a licence for 15,000 more people, so we asked a farmer if we could use a bit more of his land and start a new area,” Emily says. “I wanted the Park to be really random, musically – stuff which you wouldn’t see anywhere else. It’s got its own feel.”“I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It’s wrong.” This blinkered view from Noel Gallagher teed up one of the funniest moments in Glastonbury history: Jay-Z opening his headline performance with a sarcastic version of Wonderwall. When it segued into 99 Problems and onward, the energy levels never dipped.Under a blue sky turning pink, Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah was a beautiful moment of secular communion. He took his hat off and held it to his chest, a gesture of awed respect for a Glastonbury crowd that always does singalongs better than any other festival.Emily calls this “a very emotional end to the weekend”, and how: Damon Albarn cried as he led his reunited band into a climatic This Is a Low. “That’s what we dreamed of, that sense of commune – we’d done it,” Albarn later said.“We can get Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash why can’t we get Neil Young?” Emily thought. “And Springsteen as well. As it happened, they both said yes the same year. Although Jay-Z helped get Springsteen, to some degree, because the festival was a talking point in the US, which it hadn’t been before.“Neil Young walked on stage and looked like he was thinking, ‘Am I going to enjoy this?’ But by the end he was really smiling. It was such an amazing gig, definitely one of our best moments. Springsteen opened with Coma Girl, which is a song Joe Strummer wrote about Glastonbury. Playing that song, it personalised the set, made it different to a stadium show and made people feel like he really understood it. The power of Bruce when he goes for it is like nothing else – we were all blown away.”“We wanted to have a bigger area for late-night entertainment,” Emily says, “instead of just dancing outside a blanket stall.” This was the south-east “naughty” corner and Shangri-La, a kind of post-apocalyptic walk-through rave-cum-art-gallery, turned it into an otherworldly destination. Emily came up with the name because “my dad always called the farm Shangri-La. He didn’t really like going on holiday, and whenever we got back he always be like: ‘Aaah, Shangri-La, the best place on Earth!’”The Park has hosted plenty of big secret gigs, from Pulp to Foals, although the biggest coup of all was an acoustic set from Thom Yorke, with Johnny Greenwood turning up to play piano on Karma Police. The festival had changed enormously in the 10 years since Eavis was hauled up in front of the police – and Benn’s contribution was no longer needed. “Melvin was a marvellous chap but he was a control freak,” Michael says, picking this out as a key, if not strictly great, moment. “We didn’t need him any more, because we knew what we were doing. It was my show, and yet he was doing all the donkey work – he didn’t like that combination and said he didn’t enjoy coming down. I said, well, can we call it a day then? He was unhappy to go – we probably did fall out. But two jockeys on a horse doesn’t really work, does it? We’re best of friends now, though.”Beyoncé’s Vegas-style revue of a set, straddling power ballads, Prince and Etta James covers, a six-song Destiny’s Child medley and a version of Kings of Leon’s Sex on Fire, saw her make sure every single person in the 100,000-strong audience was having a good time. They responded with remarkable vocal dexterity in a raucous rendition of Irreplaceable.“Kate Moss and all those fashion icons were saying: ‘You want to get U2, they want to do it,’” Michael says. “Eventually I had a phone call to my kitchen from their agent, saying the band want to play. I picked the wrong day for the weather it did rain, but they did a wonderful set. Incredibly well-mannered, that lot.”In terms of crowd-pleasing headliners, the Rolling Stones have arguably never been topped. Read Mick Jagger’s memories of the performance here. If Johnny Cash set the trend for the Sunday-afternoon slot, Dolly supercharged it. “She’s the ultimate teatime legend,” Emily says. “So many different tribes came to see her. She talked about her upbringing on a farm and how she had this love for mud, and everyone warmed to her. In person, she was lovely, warm, friendly, and my kids were completely transfixed. Everything about her oozes perfection and grace, with her voice, and accent, and songs – it was like this magical person had arrived.”“The Dalai Lama was turning 80 that year, so we asked him to come,” Emily says. “We were thinking: who could give him a birthday cake? Patti Smith. Her gig was incredible – when she tripped over and said: “I’m a fucking animal!”, the crowd’s reaction was so good. Obviously I was on stage going, who put that lead there? But the energy was so high, she got the audience into a bit of a trance. I was thinking, we’ve got to bring on a birthday cake and the Dalai Lama now ... It was quite a contrast, but it worked really well. I enjoy bringing people in who people wouldn’t necessarily expect to see and giving them platforms to speak. Like David Attenborough, or Pussy Riot when they brought a tank in.”With Dave Grohl doing a Stone Roses and breaking his leg, forcing Foo Fighters to pull out of their headline slot, Florence Welch got called up to the biggest gig of her life. By keeping it percussion-free, and backed by brass and acoustic guitar, her cover of the Foos’ Times Like These kept the Pyramid crowd in a kind of suspended animation.At 78, Paul McCartney was set to be the oldest Pyramid stage headliner ever this year, although that’s still nearly a decade off the oldest person ever to play the stage: Burt Bacharach, aged 87. “To walk on to that Pyramid stage, at the 5pm slot, had to be one of the most exhilarating and nerve-wracking moments of my life,” the now 92-year-old tells me. “Daylight, where faces of so many people just seemed to stretch to foreverland. I’m so grateful for the experience.”On an afternoon battling some of Somerset’s most stinking weather, Mary J Blige gave life back to the Pyramid audience with a performance of physical and spiritual indefatigability, screaming in defiance and doing repeated jumping squats in high heels. It is raining? We hadn’t noticed.“Adele grew up coming to the festival. She’s a proper child of Glastonbury,” Emily says, picking the moment she persuaded the singer to headline as one of her greatest festival moments. “But if she wanted to do 20 stadiums, they would sell out. Some people need a headline slot – she just didn’t need to do it, and doing Glastonbury is a challenge, because of the size, and you’re not playing to your own audience. We looked at the crowd for Kanye from the side of the stage, and it was pretty incredible. I’d gone through a lot of shit to get there, it was stressful it was probably one of the most isive sets we’ve done, but I’m really glad we did it. There was a huge turnout and this really charged atmosphere. The excitement and energy you could feel in the field climbed all over your body – that feeling when you’re in a crowd waiting for something magnificent to happen. I said: ‘Are you gonna do this next year? You’ve got to do this!’ And she said yes, and we shook on it.”There was a dumbstruck mood on the morning after the Brexit vote, though once the music started up, it seemed to be quickly swept away. More than ever, Glastonbury felt like a cocoon from reality, one that people sealed themselves inside with even more determination. (Perhaps there were more Brexiteers than you might expect, too.) But the issue was addressed head on with grace and stunning power by PJ Harvey, who read John Donne’s 1624 poem No Man Is an Island: “Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main … any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.”At a snap general election earlier in the month, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, chomped into the Tory majority and forced them into a minority government. He took his victory lap at Glastonbury, drawing a vast crowd and telling them: “The elites got it wrong – politics is about the lives of all of us.” The “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant sprang up throughout, and it felt like real change was in the air. Of course, it wasn’t to be, but the feeling endures that a whole swathe of young people had a political awakening here.One of the emotional high points of last year was Kylie, who had been forced to cancel in 2005 due to her breast cancer diagnosis. She finally got her moment. Chris Martin and Nick Cave guested, but Kylie’s joy – “I’ll never get you out of my head!” she told the crowd – is what really lingers.“It was such an overwhelming experience,” she says now. “I’ve never seen that many people in my life, let alone had the honour, and nerves, of performing for them. It was sensory overload, in the best way. All of the ‘experienced’ people who had advice for me before the show, they were all right: try to enjoy, feel the love, it will feel like for ever and then be over in a minute. It was, in short, one of the best experiences of my life. To feel that I had done enough in my career to be there in that moment. Also, to have the chance again, finally, after missing my headline opportunity in 2005, made it all the more emotional and a small personal triumph.”Emily offered Stormzy the headline slot back in 2017, after he blew her away on the Other Stage. “I’d never seen a live show like that before. This guy had so much talent and energy: everything we need right now on the Pyramid stage. His agent was like, really? And we said, yeah, definitely.“The 2019 set was a universal, incredible moment. Not only was it his performance, his delivery and how he was connecting to the audience, but the production stakes were high – I’ve never seen so many BMXs at the side of the stage before. It makes it worthwhile running a festival when you can have moments like that.“I walked off to tell him this was incredible – and he had had a different experience. He couldn’t hear himself on stage. People were saying no one could go in and see him. I said: ‘I need to tell him I’ve seen all sorts of gigs at Glastonbury, but I’ve never seen anything like that please let me in, I don’t want him leaving thinking that was a disaster.’ I literally held him, and told him how fucking brilliant it was, and he had to realise that. He wasn’t angry, he was just spinning. But he watched it back, and realised, and started smiling.“Despite all the criticism you get for doing things differently, all the negative stuff from other parts of the industry saying: ‘That’s ridiculous, he’s only got one album, he’s not ready’ – you’ve just got to create moments like that, otherwise it’s pointless, the whole thing. It would dissolve. But it made Glastonbury more exciting than it’s ever been.”• Kylie interview by Laura Snapes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e9339497d432b32e7e13d4036faf6f5344e3b30/669_345_4052_2432/master/4052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ab5e8ab02b2d178258061b2288ef50","title":"martin parrs glastonbury tour photo essay","story":"Coronavirus might have claimed this year’s Glastonbury festival but, undeterred, photographer  Martin Parr assessed the lay of the landThis week I should have been experiencing and photographing the Glastonbury festival for the first time. That it would have been my first is for me is matter of some regret as I have spent a long career trying to shoot a mix of all things British, and in particular iconic British events. How I managed to miss this festival is almost beyond me, given its significance in the British social calendar. I do have an excuse though, as the last weekend of June is always the AGM of Magnum, the cooperative that I am a member of, and I always felt obliged and keen to attend.So for the 50th festival I had planned to go, but as we all know it was cancelled. However, I thought it would be interesting to tour the site just before the festival would have opened, to see how it looks.I am being taken around by John from the press office, and the first thing to remember is that this is a large, busy and working farm. I photograph Steven, the farm manager, cleaning his tractor, and there are nearby piles of manure, and in front of the skeleton of the Pyramid stage is a large herd of friesian cows where normally you would see many thousands of dancing, waving festivalgoers.The other first impression is that the site is huge. This will not be news to regular attendees, but to this Glasto virgin it amazing to see the scale of it all. We pass the staff canteen, which serves 20,000 meals a day we see assorted landmark sites like the Greenpeace boat and the stone circle. We visit a site called Permaculture, where John picks some raspberries: normally at this time of year it would be a thriving market garden.All around the site are remains of the assorted attractions waiting to be brought back to life in a year’s time. There is a sense of melancholy about the whole site.We go back to base and meet Emily, and a few moments later Michael comes by in his bright red Land Rover. He is a pretty nimble 85-year-old. I explain I have taken his photo a few times and say the last time was when he opened a summer fete at an old people’s home in nearby Shepton Mallet. He says: ‘That’s the sort of thing I do!’ I shoot their portrait in front of the door to one of the farm barns.The tour continues and I go to an area with dozens of skips and many refuse lorries, a reminder that at the festival peak this is a community of more than a quarter of a million people, with all the servicing this entails. There are piles of old oil barrels which are the litter bins, which are freshly painted every year but are now looking a bit sad. I go to the festival workshop barn, where Rob is employed year-round to build and maintain the festival infrastructure.I hope to be back next year, to see the real thing in full operation, but I am grateful to have had this chance to first see the lay of the land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1acc5ddff10f1dbfd20ebc4109e5bce8a5d32f24/0_0_1280_868/master/1280.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dd1983defad9750d98b37258179020b 700w","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities. Looking back, he sees some signs of hope amid the devastation. But will the government change its approach for the impending Covid-19 economic crash?When George Osborne delivered his spending review in June 2010 it ushered in what would become a decade of austerity measures. As budgets were slashed for children’s centres, libraries, parks and welfare, they were accompanied with the phrase “we are all in this together”.   columnist John Harris has been touring the country for the entire decade, chronicling the devastation that those cuts have made in local communities for his award-winning series Anywhere But Westminster.

It’s bolting an unproven technology on to a mega-constellation that’s designed to do something else. It’s a tech and business gamble.”Giles Thorne, a research analyst at Jeffries, agreed. “This situation is nonsensical to me,” he said. “This situation looks like nationalism trumping solid industrial policy.”Every major positioning system currently in use – America’s GPS, Russia’s Glonass, China’s BeiDou, and Galileo, the EU project that the UK helped design before losing access to due to Brexit – is in a medium Earth orbit, Thorne said, approximately 20,000km from Earth. OneWeb’s satellites, 74 of which have already been launched, are in a low Earth orbit, just 1,200km up.Bowen said: “If you want to replace GPS for military-grade systems, where you need encrypted, secure signals that are precise to centimetres, I’m not sure you can do that on satellites as small as OneWeb’s.”Rather than being selected for the quality of the offering, Thorne suggested the investment was made to suit “a nationalist agenda”. OneWeb is nominally a UK business, with a UK HQ and spectrum rights registered in the UK through Ofcom.“Let’s give the government the benefit of the doubt: if the output the government wants is a UK-branded positioning system, a projection of UK power around the world and supporting the UK satellite industry base, then it is probably quicker and cheaper to smash the square peg of OneWeb into the round hole of a Galileo replacement than it is to do it from scratch,” said Thorne.On Friday evening a government spokesperson said: “We have made clear our ambitions for space and are developing a new national space strategy to bring long-term strategic and commercial benefits to the UK. We are in regular discussions with the space industry as part of this work.”OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in March in the US, where most of its operations are located, after failing to secure new funding.Previously, the UK aimed to build its own global navigation satellite system, which independent experts estimatedwould cost £3bn-£4bn. In December 2018, Theresa May, the then prime minister, said the UK expected to work with the US and other “Five Eyes” partners – a term for the multilateral intelligence agreement – to do so. But in May this year that project was put on hold, just weeks before a feasibility study into the scheme was due to be published, as its estimated cost ballooned to £5bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2459b41c4fb6e1e47bc1aeff3165960303641bf3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c133f0dcb1af0bd478576ae3fe8b35a","title":"talking horses kevin manning hopes to splash out on fiscal rules","story":"The Irish Derby winning jockey of seven years ago is hopeful of a repeat in this year’s race at the age of 53At 53, Kevin Manning has been going a lot longer than the men with whom he shares the weigh rooms of Ireland but the suggestion of retirement gets short shrift just the same. “It feels no different to me now than it did 25 years ago,” Manning said on Friday, after a session in the sauna followed by a run.He may be the envy of his younger colleagues on Saturday evening, when he partners Fiscal Rules (7.15) in the Irish Derby for his long-time employer Jim Bolger, also his father‑in-law. Both men described it as the crowning moment of their careers when they won this race seven years ago with Trading Leather but they have a fine chance to do so again with this lightly raced colt, a running-on fifth behind Siskin in the Guineas a fortnight ago.Beaten a head by Wichita on his only previous start, Fiscal Rules appeals at 7-1 against Santiago, who raced just last week at Ascot and meets a much drier surface this time. “I’m hopeful,” says the reserved Manning. “It’d be fantastic to do it again.Punters are still not allowed access to tracks when racing is on but, at least for Derby day, it will be possible to enter a racecourse to watch the action elsewhere. That is the result of some inventive thinking by -officials at -Newbury, which plans to turn its -paddock into a beer garden next -weekend and show the racing from Epsom on its big screens.The event, which will stretch into the evening with two Premier League football games, proved rather more of a hit than organisers expected. Within 45 minutes of its first mention through social media, all available spots had been reserved.An announcement of the event through Twitter met with some exasperation from people, including a couple of racecourse bookmakers, who are evidently keen for crowds to be allowed back to witness live racing. Newbury’s Harriet Collins responded: “This event is totally in line with government guidelines. But the guidelines don’t allow spectators at elite sports venues.“We weren’t sure it if would be popular but a racecourse can offer a safe space in which to do something like this. We’ve had racing behind closed doors already, so we have various procedures and flow systems in place.”Attendance will be limited to 300 people, who will be served as they sit in their groups around the paddock area. The event is due to run for nine hours from 1pm on Saturday but Collins said it would be ided into two sessions and it was not expected that many would want to stay for both. Chris Cook“It mightn’t look the highest-quality race but there’s no easy Derby. They always take plenty of winning.”Manning would become the oldest winning jockey in the modern history of the Irish Derby. The post-war record is held by Morny Wing, who was 49 when achieving his sixth success in the race, aboard Bright News in 1946.Viewers in Britain can see the Irish Derby through RacingTV, while ITV will screen a busy afternoon’s action.1.50 Newcastle It’s three years since Major Jumbo last tried this surface but he remains one of just two course winners in the field for the Chipchase and has made a lot of progress on turf since then. Kevin Ryan’s grey did well to be third in the Palace House on his return.2.05 Newmarket Boccaccio is likely to be a warm order but his rating looks stiff enough. Raatea is not so well related but he put in a good performance to land a Kempton maiden a fortnight ago, looking as though his winter break and a gelding operation had helped.2.25 Newcastle Only a couple of pounds higher than when he scored here in January, Venturous could be a lively outsider. He improved for his reappearance when second at Haydock on Wednesday and the chestnut could get a good tow into this race from his 11 rivals.2.40 Newmarket The form book suggests that Mubtasim is the better of Charlie Appleby’s two runners in this Criterion but the year-younger On The Warpath is open to greater improvement, having been seen just once in the past 13 months. He showed plenty of pace to beat Summerghand by three lengths here on his most recent outing in England.3.00 Newcastle Three-year-olds have been regular winners of the Hoppings Stakes and Virgin Snow, the only runner of that age, is interesting. She is the second foal out of the dual Oaks winner Snow Fairy and her Haydock win recently showed she is improving as one would expect for time and distance.3.15 Newmarket Gelded over the winter, Volkan Star made a promising comeback second at this level three weeks ago. He is going to improve for another quarter-mile but this looks within his compass.3.35 Newcastle It’s a pity to see the Northumberland Plate run for £24,000, half what Carnwennan received for winning the consolation race last year. But a strong field has assembled just the same and Australis looks the pick of them. An impressive specimen, Roger Varian’s four-year-old has plenty more to offer at this distance, judging by the way he powered through the line at Wolverhampton three weeks ago. Caravan Of Hope had travelled more strongly but could not live with Australis at the end and it may be a similar story here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b859011a55a84536a66367431fdea9315733ea6f/0_199_3741_2245/master/3741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc4862e58899715b84cdf06df0c982e","title":"government roadmap to reopen uk arts venues dismissed as meaningless","story":"Plan announced by culture secretary Oliver Dowden lacks investment and timeframes say theatre unions and creativesIt was presented as a “roadmap” with a “clear pathway” for the reopening of the UK’s performing arts venues, which face devastation as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the strategy unveiled on Thursday by culture secretary Oliver Dowden has been dismissed as “meaningless” and “woeful” by theatre unions, with creatives across the industry adding to the chorus of disapproval.What Dowden’s five-step roadmap crucially lacks, they argue, is investment in the arts, detailed timeframes and a reimagining of business models in light of how theatres can operate in the near future. Christine Payne, general secretary of Equity, said the union had given comprehensive feedback to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on its draft guidance for how live performance can begin again. “We have made it crystal clear,” she said, “that without an investment plan to protect jobs and workplaces, these efforts to develop return-to-work guidance will be meaningless.”Payne added: “Much of the industry cannot viably operate without targeted investment in infrastructure and ongoing support for organisations and the workers associated with them – whether they are permanent employees, freelance or self-employed.”The first two phases of DCMS’s roadmap are already allowed: physically distanced rehearsal and training without an audience, and physically distanced performances for broadcast and recording purposes. The next stages are to allow outdoor and (initially in pilot form) indoor performances, with a limited-distance audience, and finally to allow all performances, admitting a fuller audience indoors.Jon Morgan, director of the Theatres Trust, a national advisory public body for theatres, said the plan was “a move in the right direction” but that without offering a timescale for when audiences will be admitted to performances “theatres will still be unable to plan effectively for their reopening”. The impact of this uncertainty, he said, is “devastating” for the industry. Without guidance on dates and a financial rescue package, Morgan predicts a “cultural catastrophe” for the UK.Philippa Childs, head of the broadcasting union Bectu, criticised the lack of detail in the plan and said: “It demonstrates how little understanding there is in government of what is happening in the industry and what is needed to help. Theatre workers are being made redundant now and theatres are going into administration now.” A roadmap, she said, “is fine – as long as you have enough fuel in the tank to get there. Many theatres don’t and this much awaited announcement falls woefully short of what is needed.”Dowden’s announcement came towards the end of a week that has seen further news of redundancy processes commencing for arts organisations across the UK, including the Theatre Royal Plymouth, Newcastle Theatre Royal and Horsecross Arts, the creative organisation and charity behind Perth Concert Hall and Perth theatre. Staff are also at risk of redundancy at Birmingham Hippodrome and Wales Millennium Centre.Iniduals working in the arts industry also criticised the roadmap, with the performer and writer Scottee addressing a series of tweets to Dowden, concluding: “This isn’t good enough. Your peers in Germany, Ireland, France, New Zealand and Australia have already all dedicated specific financial support to the art sector – its time you lobbied your government to do the same.” Actor Kok-Hwa Lie said the plan was meaningless without a timeline and support: “The points made in this ‘roadmap’ are so obvious, any theatre professional could have written this weeks ago.” The playwright Morgan Lloyd Malcolm tweeted: “You can’t fool creatives @OliverDowden we know you’re procrastinating. We know cos we’re pros at it. I make lists like this when I should be writing instead of writing. Then I have a cup of tea and consider it a good morning of work. Even I know this isn’t good practice.”Announcing the plan, Dowden said: “I know the public wants its theatres open, our brilliant performers want to go back to work, and we will do all we can to get them fully back up and running.” A government spokesperson said that all decisions on timing will be taken in light of expert medical advice and the latest social distancing guidelines, and stated: “We are doing all we can to support these industries through government grants, loans, the furlough scheme and the Arts Council’s £160 million emergency response package. We are also considering ways in which we may be able to support it further on top of the unprecedented financial assistance we have already provided.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6c6f6b361126201967a2377272c88863774d9ee/0_331_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3aa60403cf2bc8a54d55b4b87dea977","title":"britons to be allowed to holiday abroad from july via air bridges","story":"Ministers also expected to end policy of quarantining arrivals to the UK for 14 daysOverseas holidays will be given the green light from early next month, with the government expected to suspend the 14-day quarantine period for a series of countries and also to set up so-called air bridge arrangements for overseas destinations.While the full list of countries involved is still being confirmed, the initial phase of travel opening up is expected to involve European nations including France, Greece, Spain and possibly Portugal, with other potentially more distant locations to follow.At the same time, the current Foreign Office travel warning against all but essential international travel will be lifted for countries deemed safe.The list of approved countries is due to be announced around the middle of next week, with people allowed to start travelling from the following week, starting 6 July. Before then the government hopes to reach agreements on mutual travel routes with the nations involved.The list of permitted destinations will remain fluid, with what is described as a “strict handbrake mechanism”, meaning any sudden outbreak of coronavirus in certain countries – or even in particular parts of a country – could require travellers unexpectedly to isolate for two weeks when they return to the UK.The initial list of safe countries has been drawn up by the government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre, working with Public Health England, with nations ranked as green, amber and red based on the risk from Covid-19, the trajectory of the virus’s spread, and an assessment of the reliability of data. People will be able to travel freely to both green and amber countries.The decision, which had been widely anticipated, and called for by a number of Conservative MPs and the travel and aviation industries, means the policy of forcing all arrivals to the UK to quarantine for 14 days will have lasted just three weeks, falling at its first scheduled review.Critics had said the blanket policy was delayed and largely pointless when many arrivals would be coming from countries with lower Covid-19 infection rates than the UK.Since 8 June nearly all passengers have been required to go into self-isolation for 14 days at a declared address when they arrive in the UK. People who fail to comply can be fined £1,000 in England, and police are allowed to use “reasonable force” to make sure they follow the rules.The International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) branded the blanket quarantine measures “illogical” and budget airline Ryanair labelled them “idiotic rubbish”.The quarantine policy will stay in place for anyone coming from countries not deemed safe, and all passengers will still need to provide contact information when they arrive in the UK.People will also be obliged by law to wear masks on planes, ferries and Eurostar trains, with travel terminals adapting their practices so travellers can physically distance.A government spokeswoman said: “Our public health measures at the border were put in place to manage the risk of imported cases and help prevent a second wave of the virus, and will continue to support our fight against coronavirus.“Our new risk-assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world – giving people the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad and boosting the UK economy through tourism and business. But we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if any risks re-emerge, and this system will enable us to take swift action to reintroduce self-isolation measures if new outbreaks occur overseas.”The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has agreed that the blanket advice on non-essential international travel, imposed on 17 March, will be lifted for relevant countries from 6 July but it will be kept under review.The news was welcomed by Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons transport select committee, and who has been an advocate for a system of air bridges.“This welcome announcement indicates a move towards a more risk-based and nuanced approach,” he said. “It’s vital that the government uses all of the policy levers available to it in order to rescue the aviation sector and the jobs of those who depend on it.”There was some uncertainty about how the system would work on a UK-wide basis, with discussions with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland taking place on Friday. Before the announcement, there had been concern within the Scottish and Welsh governments about a lack of consultation on the issue, which requires agreement from all four nations.One Welsh government source said before the announcement that communication with London had been “patchy”. The source said: “Each of the four nations has its own chief medical officer, and so anything coming from the UK government has to go through our own chief medical officer advice. We are willing to help but they are leaving it late.”A UK government source said on Friday that all four devolved nations had signed up to the plan. However, a Scottish government spokesman said nothing had been decided: “No final decisions, including on the possibility of amending or adding to the exemptions, have been made and we await confirmation of a planned four-nation ministerial meeting ahead of any announcement being made.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f49d004ff003d1ffc585eaae8dc6295c575139f/0_187_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f9789d660be5bea074b967c1c58350e","title":"comedian eric andre we dont tell guests a thing they waltz into a house of horrors","story":"Andre’s surreal take on the US chatshow has won him a cult following. Is the mainstream ready for his radical comedy?There has only been one sketch that Eric Andre couldn’t get past the executives at Adult Swim. The suits didn’t bat an eyelid at Andre interviewing the reality TV star Lauren Conrad with a lipstick swastika on his forehead. No one pulled the plug when he beat up his naked personal assistant in front of Wiz Khalifa. It was all good when he turned up at the 2016 Republican convention and urinated on a banner while shouting “Black Lives Bladder”. Instead, the skit that was deemed too offensive to air was a simple country ditty … dedicated to the global Salafist terrorist network, al-Qaida.“We had a country singer come in,” explains Andre. “His angle was that al-Qaida has got a ‘bad rap’ in the country community, so we should sing a pro-al-Qaida song. He was like: “Oh, sweet, al-Qaaaaaaaaaida, can’t believe I never tried yaaaaaaaaaah.”Andre thinks the executives got cold feet because they were getting so much hate mail for another show: Black Jesus, in which the son of God is depicted as a guy from Compton. “Racist evangelical people were like: ‘Jesus is not black. How dare you desecrate his name?’ I was eating mushrooms in the woods in Canada with this girl I was dating, and I got a call from Adult Swim and they were like: ‘Hey, you gotta take that song out. The boss’s boss’s boss said that’s a no go.’”If that story was coming from someone else, you might dismiss it as apocryphal, but this is Eric Andre. Since starting his late-night show on Adult Swim, Cartoon Network’s after-hours alter ego, in 2012, he has placed a stack of ACME dynamite sticks beneath the conventions of late-night chatshows and unceremoniously blown them all up. The result is one of the most dysfunctional 15 minutes to appear on any channel, ever. Part stoner fever dream, part nightmarish send-up of Jimmy Kimmel and co, it has all the elements of late night: a host with a desk (Andre), a co-host without a desk (comedian and Broad City star Hannibal Buress), a house band (a bizarro jazz five-piece), special guests (everyone from the actual Dolph Lundgren to a George Clooney impersonator) – but minus any hint of logic.Its first season opened with Andre smashing up the show’s set in a state of undress before pulling his own teeth out, while Buress looked on, barely conscious. It set the tone: most episodes involve Andre destroying either the set or himself or both, and, unsurprisingly, that has led to a long list of injuries. He reveals that he was hospitalised with concussion after wrestler-turned-actor John Cena threw him through a bookcase in the show’s upcoming season. There was the time he got stitches in his hand after he punched through a car window, and during an interview with Vivica A Fox he crashed into his desk and wrenched his back. “We used to not have any stunt pads or a stunt coordinator,” he says of the show’s early days. “I was just, like, wiping out. It was brutal. I was destroying myself.”From a UK point of view, the show’s closest relatives are Vic and Bob’s anarchic mid-90s efforts and some of the Brass Eye sit-downs where Chris Morris would run absurdist circles round stunned guests. Like on Brass Eye, Andre’s early guests were often D-listers but, unlike Morris’s show, which originally wanted huge names, the lowly level of the talent was absolutely intentional. The key for Andre was getting someone who knew next to nothing about the show – ideally “reality people, athletes, people on procedural dramas”, because they are sitting ducks for pranks. As the show has progressed (its fifth season is in post-production) the names have got bigger – Jack Black and Chance the Rapper have both appeared. But Andre says now the status of the stars makes no difference.“We got it down to a science where we can kind of make it work with anybody. When tarantulas and scorpions are popping out of my desk, it doesn’t matter who they are, they’re going to have a strong reaction,” says Andre. “We don’t tell the guests a single thing before they come to set, and they waltz right into a house of horrors.” Occasionally, Andre meets his match. “Dennis Rodman told me he kissed a dead girl,” he says, still sounding genuinely perplexed. “He was very hard to prank or disturb. I just play a lunatic on TV he’s a 247 lunatic.”Born to an African-Haitian father and a Jewish mother, and raised in Florida’s “boring homogenised suburbs”, Andre made Jackass-style videos with his friends before he went to college in Boston to study the double bass. He soon gave up music for comedy – his influences  Tom Green’s pranks and Joan Rivers’s ribald one-liners to Chappelle’s Show. He began gigging in New York and LA with Buress, with whom he worked to create a pilot that was shot in the basement of a Brooklyn bodega and edited by Andre. He targeted Adult Swim, which was known for its alternative programming, but he was on unemployment benefit and desperately needed the work. “I remember looking at my computer screen and reading the email that said we had the first season and letting out this guttural, primal, caveman scream out of excitement,” says Andre. “My neighbour came out and she goes: ‘Are you OK?’ And I said: ‘Sorry, I just found out that I’m gonna have a career.’”On the phone, Andre is calm and considered, a world away from his frenetic chatshow host persona. He currently lives in Los Angeles, and for the last few days has been trying to figure out how to react to the death of George Floyd and police brutality in the US. He has been sharing posts about defunding the police and attending rallies, but Andre approaches politics in his work cautiously. “You don’t want to come off too preachy or heavy-handed,” he says. “You got to mix the highbrow and lowbrow to make it fun. There’s political satire in the mix, but it’s not like full-on. I’m not Bill Maher or Jon Stewart.”The show’s relationship to race at first glance seems more overt: there is a mixed-race host and black co-host on a late-night show. In 2012, that fact alone made it markedly different from the sea of all-white “Jimmys and Daves” who dominated the landscape. But Andre has largely left that aspect lingering in the background. “I thought it’d be more interesting if it’s these two dysfunctional black hosts who barely mentioned race.”That sideways take on race was developed when Andre moved to New York and started performing standup sets. “I felt like every black comedian or every comedian of colour had to talk about their race,” says Andre, who started gigging with Buress and found a kindred spirit in a comic who was black but didn’t do conventional race comedy. “What am I going to say about blackness that Richard Pryor, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle haven’t covered?”Yet, underneath the seemingly aimless madness of Andre’s sketches there is something more radical afoot. In season one, skits included Andre sprinting through an all-white civil war re-enactment dressed as a runaway slave. In another he walks into a strip club dressed as Thomas Jefferson and demands a lapdance from a “big-bottomed, negro woman”. At a Tea Party event, he turns up to give attendees a goodie bag of Ku Klux Klan hoods, Confederate flags and White Power placards that they’d “forgotten”. In many of his man-on-the-street skits, the mere presence of a black man in an unlikely social situation is half the joke.That approach also bleeds into his standup special, which features an of-the-moment skit about the US reality show Cops and its inappropriate cod-reggae soundtrack. “You can’t slap reggae over police brutality footage and call it a day,” he tells the audience. Cops has since been cancelled as part of a wider reckoning over police violence. Andre puts his gag down to what he calls “pure good lucky timing”, but has also revealed that Netflix wanted him to remove the joke. He pushed back, saying it was the perfect time to point out the “absurdity of the police department and what a fucking hypocrisy and a disgrace it is”.Creative freedom and having the right to offend are notions that Andre holds dear. We talk on the same day that Netflix decides to remove The Mighty Boosh because of concerns that the Spirit of Jazz character (played by Noel Fielding in black makeup) was problematic. Andre isn’t impressed. “That is so missing the point,” he says. “It is about justice, equality, putting an end to police brutality. No one in the Black Lives Matter movement is like: ‘Yeah, you know The Mighty Boosh has been oppressing us all these years with that peripheral recurring character.’”For Andre, defending comics’ right to be offensive is an absolute. “I constantly defend black people, but I constantly defend comedy,” he says. “I’m constantly trying to push my shit to the edge. I’m an equal opportunity offender like Trey Parker and Matt Stone. We have to laugh at the absurdity and the pain of life. And when you water it down or make it awkwardly political when it isn’t, it’s missing the point.”Ultimately, Andre says, writing his show is very simple. He asks a group of comedians into the writers’ room and “we crack each other up. Comedy is like primal and instinctual. The process is: that made me laugh. Let’s shoot it. I’m not building a hydrogen bomb over here.”Eric Andre: Legalize Everything is on Netflix now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432cdd1ac9a9cc4412e5c1d1da7bc9c0ec56d3ad/0_61_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09fd3292922cb7b286b9592eb98b0b22","title":"tv tonight glastonbury is back with a dose of nostalgia","story":"The 50th anniversary year is marked with a look at stellar past performances from Coldplay to Bruce Springsteen.

That will mean it does not want standards to go on developing along parallel lines.”Negotiations between the UK and EU are in deadlock over whether Britain needs to tie itself to the EU’s developing state aid rules and common environmental, social and labour standards in return for a zero-tariff trade deal.Merkel’s ambassador in Brussels, Michael Clauss, recently said he expected Brexit to command most of the political attention in the autumn, fanning British hopes that Germany’s six-month EU council presidency could push the negotiations back to the top of the political agenda before the extension period ends on 31 December.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc.

What needs to be done in this case is something extraordinary. Germany had a low debt ratio and can afford, in this extraordinary situation, to take on some more debt. It is also very important to us to keep the programme within the bounds of the European treaties. We have found a way to do that.”Her goal, Merkel said, was for the EU’s response to eventually match the multilateral response to the 2008 financial crisis. “These days, we have to do all we can to stop ourselves collapsing into protectionism. If Europe wants to be heard, then it needs to set a good example.”Merkel and Macron’s initiative faces resistance from Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Even if they can sway the “frugal four”, in the coming months there is likely to be a scramble for access to recovery packag funds.“Because of the different degrees of damage inflicted by the pandemic, the distribution has to be based on a different formula from the one applied to normal European budgets,” said Merkel. “I hope that this argument will be accepted. This unusual challenge requires us to take an unusual path.“For countries which are already heavily in debt, more borrowing makes less sense than grants. I am working to convince the remaining countries which have so far been in favour of loans but against grants.”Some suggest Merkel’s seeming reinvention from arch-austerian to big spender has been forced by the German constitutional court’s ruling on 5 May, questioning the legality of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme, and thus the entirety of the EU’s legal regime.“Without a doubt, European law has precedence over national law – but that does not tell us where the realm of European law begins and ends,” said Merkel. “The essence of the European Union lies in the member states transferring powers. In the borderland between the spheres of jurisdiction of national and European law, friction can occur if the European level defines its limits more broadly than, for example, the German Parliament does. That’s what we are seeing in the ECB case.”While the ruling of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe represented “a conflict”, Merkel said, it did not fundamentally challenge the legal order of the EU: “That is the nature of the beast, since a nation state will always be able to lay claim to particular powers unless all powers are transferred to the European institutions, which is surely not going to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f161866caaff0d04969d53d924b73f8f213cd3c/0_0_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ac282b39e0d385231cc6830c729e7fd","title":"european union us visitors coronavirus","story":"Officials draw up ‘safe list’ of countries whose residents can visit, with Russia and Brazil also excludedEU officials are in the process of settling on a final “safe list” of countries whose residents could travel to the bloc in July, but the US, Brazil and Russia are set to be excluded, Reuters reported.

It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.The government has been at loggerheads for weeks with teaching unions, who claim plans to reopen schools while maintaining physical distancing are fanciful. Concerns have been raised that children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, will fall behind in their education if schools do not reopen, but unions have maintained that doing so must be safe and practical.The phased opening of schools in England began at the beginning of June, but the government shelved plans to get every primary school child back in class for at least a month before the summer holiday, in the face of the opposition from unionsand some scientists.Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday that there would be full attendance at schools in September, as he detailed how the lockdown would be eased, but unions said that was still unrealistic. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said that even with the physical distancing rule reduced to 1 metre, it was “pure fantasy” to imagine schools would have the space to take back all pupils. The National Education Union said more teachers would be needed.Christina Pagel, a scientist at University College London and a member of Sage, said the decision to relax restrictions was a concern, given the proportion of people currently being reached by test and trace.“America’s seen a massive surge and I’m worried we’re going to be in a situation here where we don’t spot these increases until it’s too late,” she said. Changes such as pub and restaurant  openings planned for 4 July in England were a greater source of concern than the prospect of schools fully reopening in September, she said.When Johnson announced the September plan, he said: “Children who can already go to school should do so because it is safe.” Only a minority of children eligible to return to school in England, however, have done so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6b0133fad044783951a97015706a67fecb37f59/0_134_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d815b0d2dfa97e12320d91e3c8fdc290","title":"irish government to be formed after greens vote yes to coalition","story":"Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will now have a working majority in Irish parliament Ireland’s next government will be formed on Saturday after the Green party voted resoundingly to enter a coalition with two larger rivals.It signed up to a programme that promises radical action on climate change but will also have to shoulder the burden of leading the country’s economic recovery from Covid-19.Its deputy leader, Catherine Martin, said: “Now we will move forward together, respecting the democratic wishes of the majority of our party at all times, listening to each other … working in unity to protect our country and our planet.”The Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, will take over the role of Irish taoiseach from Leo Varadkar in an historic reconciliation of a political feud with Fine Gael dating back to the foundation of the state a century ago.The two larger parties needed the support of the Greens to have a working majority in the Irish parliament, equating to about 80 seats.

They have to vote on constitutional amendments that include allowing Vladimir Putin to remain in the Kremlin potentially until 2036.Organisers of Russia’s pseudo-referendum to amend the constitution – originally scheduled for 22 April but delayed owing to the coronavirus outbreak – appear to be making up the rules as they go along.In a single vote, Russians must choose whether to support a package of amendments that include pension and minimum wage boosts, a modest reorganisation of government, a constitutional mention of “faith in god”, a ban on gay marriage, exhortations to preserve Russian history, and a ban on top officials holding dual citizenship.Ads for the vote barely mention that it will also reset term limits for Putin, who has ruled since 2000. It is not an official referendum and the rules are custom-designed. Unlike in normal elections, voting is allowed online and takes place over a week, between 25 June and 1 July. As Russia continues to grapple with the coronavirus, some voting officials have decided it is safer to collect ballots outdoors, planting ballot boxes on tree stumps, in the boots of cars, in public buses and on plastic patio furniture.The referendum is both momentous and absurd. Russians can endorse (or oppose) a plan to let Putin run for two more terms, potentially prolonging his rule beyond that of Stalin, and then win a washing machine or a hairdryer.“It looks like a gameshow but I’m telling everybody I know to take this seriously, it’s enough to make you lose your mind,” said Oleg Kharlamov, a laboratory technician from Moscow who said he intended to vote against the amendments. The vote would help determine “who’s in charge for the next generation, and if we complain, they will say … ‘you voted for it’,” he said.Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Russia holds a yesno referendum on various topics including a proposal to amend the constitution to allow Putin to seek another two terms in the Kremlin.The raffles and prize giveaways are just part of a broad get-out-the-vote effort endorsed by the government. Companies have authorised their own prize giveaways that could allow them to track employee voting, while government workers such as teachers and doctors – some of whom are busy fighting the coronavirus outbreak – are reportedly being urged to cast ballots, in systematic attempts to boost turnout.Meanwhile, Instagram and TikTok influencers claim they have been offered millions of roubles by shady middlemen to urge their young followers to vote.Analysts say the Kremlin has concluded that the rescheduled referendum had to happen now, after Russia had declared victory over the coronavirus (despite more than 7,000 new cases a day still being reported) and before the effects of a battered economy or a potential second wave further sour public opinion.There are broad concerns that the results will be manipulated, particularly with limited scope to monitor polling places and online voting. Pavel Lobkov, a reporter for TV Rain, managed to vote in person at a polling station and then online on Thursday as the polls opened, effectively casting two ballots. Election officials said his extra vote would be discounted.There is almost no likelihood the vote will fail. Weeks before the vote, publishers had begun stocking Moscow bookstores with copies of the amended constitution.Rather than an emphatic public endorsement of Putin, the vote has more resembled a chore that must be done.“It will be something that the bureaucratic machine will be happy to get off its chest. ‘We’re done, now let’s forget about it,’” said Yekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. She added that the vote was more of a burden on the Kremlin’s political resources than a chance to win a new political mandate. “It will not be the source of additional legitimacy to the political regime or to the president inidually.”The government campaign has avoided reminding Russians that they are potentially endorsing Putin’s right to rule until 2036, which Schulmann said was most isive amendment. Instead, billboards have urged Russians to “preserve family values” or featured images of the poet Alexander Pushkin saying “protect our language and culture”. Putin himself dangled the possibility of amending the constitution in 2012 but then boasted at his restraint in leaving the country’s founding document untouched. When he returned to the idea in the last year, advisors understood that the campaign would be isive. But despite calling for the referendum, Putin has exhibited a characteristic disdain for campaign politics, barely advocating for his own measures.The vote was targeted at stabilising elite circles, argued Stanovaya. “He needs a reference that he can show his elites and say: ‘I have public support to rule for as long as I believe I need to. No one of you has the right to discuss successors.”There remains debate over whether Putin will actually return for terms five and six or simply wants to avoid becoming a lame duck. As he himself argued during a TV interview last week, his potential return will put to bed discussions of a possible successor for the coming four years. Or 10. Or 16."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceb5f537dd431b113d8329c379b7aed9957d65fb/0_138_2056_1234/master/2056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc8f0d736c4955661cc7d0444c461a51","title":"sumos heaviest ever wrestler urges others to keep eating habits in check","story":"Ōrora, who hit 292kg before he retired, warns wrestlers need to care of themselves after death of colleague from coronavirusJapan’s sumo wrestlers should rein in their enormous appetites and take better care of their health. The advice comes not from doctors or nutritionists, but from a former wrestler who weighed more than any other man in the sport’s long history.“It’s never easy to stay healthy as long as you’re living the life of a sumo wrestler,” Ōrora, a retired professional wrestler, or rikishi, said in a recent interview with the Asahi Shimbun, soon after a young wrestler died after contracting coronavirus. “You are the only person that can take care of yourself. Nobody in your sumo stable cares about you.”The Russian wrestler, who now uses his “civilian” name, Anatoly Mikhakhanov, said the sumo route to gaining weight – two gargantuan meals a day separated by an afternoon nap – was putting wrestlers’ health at risk.The dangers of a lifestyle that combines intense physicality and bulk-building food intake were underlined last month when Shobushi, a wrestler in one of the lower professional ranks, died from Covid-19. Doctors who treated the 28-year-old said he had several chronic health conditions.The sumo diet staple chanko nabe – a stew packed with meat, fish and vegetables – is high in protein and low in fat. But Mikhakhanov, who retired in 2018, knows to his cost how pressure to pile on the pounds can tempt wrestlers into consuming more than the 4,000 calories they need to refuel after gruelling early-morning training sessions.Weighing an already hefty 190kg when he turned professional, Mikhakhanov saw his weight increase to 292.6kg shortly before he retired. In 2017, he became the heaviest professional rikishi ever at 288kg, beating the record previously held by the Hawaii-born Konishiki, who tipped the scales at 285kg.Mikhakhanov would routinely polish off 200 pieces of sushi and a crate of beer, and found it impossible to refuse offers of extra bowls of rice from senior stablemates. As a result, he suffered from hypertension and struggled to fight off fatigue.“I would lie down right after eating, which wasn’t good,” he told the newspaper. “Just walking or moving was really troublesome.”The 37-year-old has since swapped his two huge meals a day for five smaller meals, and regular walks and gym sessions have helped him shed more than 100kg. “Of course, you can’t train unless you eat, but there’s no point in making yourself ill,” he said.Mikhakhanov was not alone in struggling to keep his eating habits in check. “Wrestlers in the highest makuuchi ision weigh and average of 160.2kg – 15kg heavier than three decades ago, and have an average body mass index of more than 47, while medical professionals warn that a BMI of 30 or higher indicates obesity.“Some are extremely diligent about what they eat some aren’t,” says Gunning, whose weight doubled to 120kg within two years of making his debut in 2004. “The bigger and heavier you are the better you’ll be. This is not an aerobic sport. If you want to be good you have to get big, and that can come at the expense of your health.”While other intense contact sports such as rugby and American football have adopted new approaches to training and nutrition, Japan’s de facto national sport is anchored to tradition.“There is pressure on wrestlers to get bigger and stronger, but there has been no significant change in training methods or nutrition,” says Gunning, who represented Ireland three times at the sumo world championships. “They’re doing the same exercise routines, eating the same things and living the same lifestyle as 20 years ago … or 200 years ago.”The Japan Sumo Association has published 10 health guidelines that include eating fish and vegetables, in addition to meat, chewing food properly and avoiding crisps, cakes and other snacks. The association conducts regular health checks on wrestlers, but enforcing good eating habits is practically impossible among stables with contrasting attitudes towards nutrition and health.“Most wrestlers are in their late teens and early 20s in a testosterone-fuelled support. They’re fighting every day and they don’t have much freedom,” says Gunning. “The pressure builds but there’s no way to release it. Overeating relieves stress and gets you big. I did it myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/641c936e1b234f9bdf92bb369b280870083346bd/2511_2012_2184_1311/master/2184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f31aac69b43943db9c89cff5afdc31c7","title":"three more midlands meat factory workers test positive for coronavirus","story":"Health officials in England and Wales monitoring new cases linked to food processing plants Another three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed at a meat processing factory in the Midlands.Tulip Ltd confirmed on Friday that three employees, including two from the same household, had tested positive after a fresh batch of tests were carried out on more than 100 staff on Monday.All three, alongside other employees who may have been infected during close contact, are isolating at home.The company said it was continuing to work with Public Health England Midlands, the Health and Safety Executive, the local NHS and Sandwell council, after confirmation of other coronavirus cases last week.Dr Lisa McNally, Sandwell’s director of public health, said: “We have now proactively tested 104 staff at Tulip Ltd for coronavirus and have had three positive cases.

The health ministry also reported 990 additional deaths taking the total to just under 56,000.The new figures came amid warnings that the spread through smaller towns in Brazil’s interior risked a return of infections in major cities, dubbed a “boomerang effect,” as a lack of specialised medical treatment forced patients into larger urban centres.“The boomerang of cases that will return to the (state) capitals will be a tsunami,” said Miguel Nicolelis, a leading medical neuroscientist at Duke University who is coordinating a coronavirus taskforce advising the state governments of Brazil’s northeast.The United States reported its highest daily number of infections, with more than 40,000 cases.

Its current income of $5,250 per head is projected to rise to above $10,000 next year alone.In a court-enforced and delayed regional and general election on 2 March, the ruling president, David Granger, a retired general, claimed victory and control of the assembly, but was then forced to hold a national recount since it was evident a massive voter fraud had been perpetrated. A recount found the opposition party had won the most votes.A court hearing next Wednesday due to be held at Guyana’s highest court, the Caribbean court of justice, has been called to settle the issue finally more than three months after the Guyanese went to the polls. But there are signs that Granger will not recognise the court’s jurisdiction, placing the international community in a dilemma.Speaking to the Canning House thinktank, Greg Quinn, the British high commissioner in Guyana, said: “It has been 116 days since the election. No population should have to wait that long. We need an election result.” Calling for reconciliation and constitutional reform, he said: “Many issues around the election reflect ethnic polarisation and a winner takes all system that is no longer fit for purpose.”The final election outcome will have a big impact on Guyana’s future relationship with the oil industry. Many observers claim Exxon’s current licence to extract oil needs renegotiating and reflects an entrenched political class.Others say Guyana is on the edge of a bonanza and will become the richest oil country on earth as measured by income per capita. Either way, the impasse over the election result may undermine investor confidence.The centre of the contested votes is in the largest election district, region four (Demerara Mahaica). Despite widespread objections including from international electoral observers but not from the Partnership for National UnityAlliance For Change (APNUAFC) coalition of the defeated President Granger, the returning officer proceeded to make a declaration based on his numbers that were at odds with the figures on official documents.But the international diplomatic pressure, and voter anger, forced a 34-day full national recount exercise, which ended in a victory for the opposition People’s Progressive PartyCivic (PPPC). The recounted figures published on 7 June showed the opposition PPP winning the elections with 233,336 votes while the APNUAFC received 217,920 votes.But the chief elections officer, Keith Lowenfield, then submitted a report denouncing impersonations and invalidating 115,844 votes – nearly a quarter of all votes cast – so giving the APNUAFC a win of 5,482 votes. The opposition PPP, initially credited with 233,336 votes, had its vote slashed by Lowenfield to 166,343, a reduction of of 66,993.The recount process had been scrutinised by a high-level Caricom team, which in its report to the Guyana Elections Commission last week said that “nothing we witnessed, warrants a challenge to the inescapable conclusion that the recount results are acceptable and should constitute the basis of the declaration of results of the March 2, 2020 elections”.Other international observers have expressed their unease at the election. The heads of the ABCE diplomatic missions in Guyana – United States, Britain, Canada and the EU – stressed that “every vote cast by every voter” must be reflected in the declaration of the final elections results.The Commonwealth secretary general, Lady Scotland, has also urged Guyana to reflect on its democratic reputation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66011f9a93eb8ec59af22f029189af8af4c20c5/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d486590ef290da7facf29fb06659bed3","title":"poles set to vote in postponed presidential election","story":"Incumbent Andrzej Duda expected to face run-off against liberal mayor of WarsawPoles will vote on Sunday in a postponed presidential election that will determine whether the ruling rightwing populist party continues to have full control over the country’s political system.Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, is standing for re-election in a crowded field of candidates, with the closest challenger expected to be Rafał Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw.The presidency has an important blocking role, and should Trzaskowski win he would be able to frustrate much of the PiS legislative agenda, dramatically changing the political landscape.PiS, which has ruled Poland since 2015, won a second term in power in parliamentary elections in October. It has combined a socially conservative agenda with attacks on the rule of law, causing friction with the EU. It draws much of its support from rural areas and small towns.Trzaskowski, of the Civic Platform party, which governed Poland prior to the PiS victory in 2015, has campaigned under the slogan “We have had enough” and promised a more inclusive and tolerant form of politics. “It’s time to say no lies and propaganda, and to fight for sincerity,” he told a crowd in the city of Wrocław while on the campaign trail.A source in his camp said Trzaskowski would be willing to cooperate with PiS if he won, but only if the government acceded to key demands such as reform of public television, which has functioned as a campaign booster for Duda in recent weeks.The election was meant to take place in May but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, Duda’s commanding lead in the polls has steadily dwindled, leading to an increase in homophobic rhetoric from his campaign in an attempt to boost support in the Catholic conservative PiS heartlands. Public television and PiS-friendly media outlets have attacked Trzaskowski as an “extremist candidate” over his support for LGBT rights during his time as mayor.Duda unveiled a campaign pledge to “defend children from LGBT ideology” and has even compared the so-called “ideology” to communism. Przemysław Czarnek, a PiS MP and member of Duda’s campaign team, said: “Let’s stop listening to these idiocies about human rights. These people are not equal with normal people.”Duda later attempted to row back from some of the more extreme rhetoric after it appeared to be doing him more electoral harm than good. Instead, his team hoped that an endorsement from Donald Trump would give him a last-minute lift. Duda travelled to Washington on Wednesday for a meeting at the White House, becoming the first head of state Trump has received since the start of the pandemic, in a surprisingly brazen endorsement of Duda just days before the election.In the end, Duda left the US with friendly words from Trump that the meeting would “reaffirm our vital alliance” but almost nothing in the way of concrete commitments that he could sell at home.Duda’s administration had hoped that Trump would announce an increase in the US military presence in Poland, a move that would have been popular among large numbers of Poles who are wary of the threat from Russia and generally pro-American. Instead, Trump merely hinted that some of the troops he has threatened to withdraw from Germany could be stationed in Poland, without making a firm commitment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3414b98b80c1b48b0ecddf6cc1a847c3e63632cc/50_458_5899_3540/master/5899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0b4718330c5c38b949ae6c72100f9a","title":"us restricts visas for chinese officials over hong kong freedoms","story":"Secretary of state Mike Pompeo says visa restrictions apply to ‘current and former’ communist party officials, but does not name them The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has said Washington will impose visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong, but he did not name any of those targeted.The move on Friday comes ahead of a three-day meeting of China’s parliament from Sunday, which is expected to enact new national security legislation for Hong Kong that has alarmed foreign governments and democracy activists.The US visa restrictions apply to “current and former” Chinese communist party officials “believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy,” Pompeo said, without naming them.Last month, President Trump responded to China’s plans by saying he was initiating a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial centre since its handover by Britain in 1997.Pompeo’s announcement represents the first concrete US step in response to China’s moves, but Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said visa restrictions were largely symbolic and the fact that no names were given could lessen their impact.A state department spokeswoman said relatives of designees could also be barred. A Bloomberg columnist quoted a department official as saying the number of officials targeted was “in the single digits”.Chinese embassy spokeswoman Fang Hong said China “opposes the US side’s wrongful decisions,” and added that China’s legislation targeted only “a very narrow category of acts that seriously jeopardise national security”.“We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes, withdraw the decisions and stop interfering in China’s domestic affairs,” she said.Wall Street’s major indexes tumbled on Friday after a Wall Street Journal article said US “meddling” on issues like Hong Kong and Taiwan could jeopardise Chinese purchases under a the trade deal Trump agreed with China in January, spooking investors already worried about a surge in coronavirus cases.Pompeo’s announcement comes at a time of intensified US rhetoric against Beijing as Trump campaigns for re-election. Opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward China, especially over the coronavirus.“President Trump promised to punish the Chinese communist party officials who were responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms. Today, we are taking action to do just that,” Pompeo said.He accused China of pressuring local authorities to arrest pro-democracy activists and disqualify electoral candidates, and added: “The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these concerns.”Pompeo said last week Washington would treat Hong Kong as a Chinese city rather than an autonomous one to the extent that China treated the territory as a Chinese city. He said Hong Kong elections due in September would show China’s intentions.On Thursday, the US senate approved a bill that would impose mandatory sanctions on people or companies that back efforts to restrict Hong Kong’s autonomy. It includes secondary sanctions on banks that do business with anyone backing any crackdown on the territory’s autonomy.A Hong Kong government spokesman called the legislation unacceptable, China’s official Xinhua news agency said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b1f34dab873da39def03b61cae4b908e1244e9/0_8_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe92d3952a06f1a59cba88e8dd2a1cc","title":"andrzej krauze europe easing lockdown cartoon social distancing","story":"While many Europeans would like life to return to normal in the holiday season, anxiety and confusion surround the rules on social distancing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce47f250edcb439b3a624bd44b84633e064d7f58/0_233_6131_3678/master/6131.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d6c3c1dc6c358b28b868014f078a80c","title":"coronavirus live news us records biggest daily case rise as australia continues cluster testing blitz brazil eu travel ban us","story":"US records highest daily new infections Brazil records nearly 47,000 new cases Covid cases with unknown source rise in Melbourne.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 687 to 193,243, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday.The reported death toll rose by six to 8,954 according to Reuters. India reported more than 17,000 new coronavirus cases over the last 24 hours, pushing the country’s total above 500,000, federal health ministry data showed on Saturday, with infections surging in major cities including the capital New Delhi, Reuters reported.India has the world’s fourth-biggest outbreak of the virus that causes Covid-19, below only the United States, Brazil and Russia in confirmed infections, according to a Reuters tally.Infections are expected to continue rising steadily in India. Experts advising the federal government say the authorities should now prioritise reducing mortality over containing the spread of the virus.“Our focus should be on preventing deaths and not really getting bogged down because of the numbers. Numbers are going to increase,” said Dr Manoj Murhekar, a member of India’s main coronavirus taskforce and director of the National Institute of Epidemiology.The COV-IND-19 study group, led by Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistics professor from the University of Michigan, forecasts that India could see between 770,000 and 925,000 cases by 15 July.As infections mount swiftly and hospitals become stretched, some cities such as New Delhi are scrambling to build temporary facilities with thousands of beds to quarantine and treat Covid-19 patients.The city of around 20 million people only has around 13,200 beds for Covid-19 patients and will add at least 20,000 in coming weeks, with some facilities manned by army and paramilitary doctors.Staff shortages are likely to be a concern as hospitals are swamped and more temporary facilities open, experts warn, although health authorities in some Indian cities are pushing for improved risk-based categorisation of patients.“We have to ensure those who really require treatment aren’t denied services,” said Dr Giridhar R Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, who is advising the southern state of Karnataka.On the question of testing returning travellers, van Diemen also said the evidence showed that the community cases had not “for want of a better word leaked” out of hotel quarantine through people who had declined tests. “We have not seen them,” she said. “We need to put our effort where we’re seeing cases, and where we’re seeing cases is in the suburbs where we’re doing the blitz, the hotspot suburbs, that’s really where the cases are.”Van Diemen is also asked whether Victoria is experiencing a “second wave” of coronavirus. She avoided the phrase. Terminology, really, at this point in time is not that important. Our case numbers are increasing so when you look at our overall epidemiological curve there will be, and I’m hoping very soon, a second bump or a second peak, and so that is what this is. Whether we have second, third, fifth, 10th waves, nobody really knows. This is not something any of us have experienced before.Van Diemen says more than 100 returning travellers have tested positive for Covid-19. She says she’s unable to provide details about how many defence force staff will be coming to Victoria to help with testing. It’s not her remit, she says. Van Diemen says the state is “very concerned” about the rising number of cases.Victoria has led the way on testing policy in hotel quarantine, we were the first to start any form of routine testing, we were first to start hotel testing. A statement is broadly based on the policy we pioneered. In terms of whether it is mandatory or not, every state and territory is really working under, you know, broadly similar but different regulatory and legal frameworks and we are seeking legal advice on that.We have a testing program in our hotels. We wouldn’t have implemented it if we didn’t think it was appropriate. We would like to see as many people in the program as possible. Detaining people has ramifications so our preference is people are detained for the least amount of time as possible and we’re working hard to try and make sure that is the case.Van Diemen says that an emergency text message will be sent to residents in two Melbourne suburbs – Broadmeadows and Keilor Downs – where there are a high number of cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f134cdbf097995186ccf78f6b3f7d82a1db5804/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca888a6142f7427eb20069937c8684b5","title":"nine points up on europe data shows uk increase in lgbtq harassment","story":"Before 51st anniversary of Stonewall riots, survey reveals rise in incidents of violence LGBTQ+ people in the UK and across Europe still face high levels of discrimination in all aspects of everyday life, according to a survey conducted last month by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). The survey – the largest of its kind ever conducted – focused on the social experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people in 30 European countries, and found that little progress has been made over the past seven years. Before the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, at the end of a Pride month marked by the cancellation of public events in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we take a look at what the results reveal about the issues facing LGBTQ+ people in the UK.The European averages hide significant differences between the countries, and an increase in overall negative statistics appears to be linked to the adoption of actively discriminatory policies introduced in recent years across the continent. The study shows that trans and intersex respondents face even higher levels of prejudice than other categories: since 2012 they have experienced a disproportionate rise in discrimination and violence in all areas of daily life. In the UK, discrimination in the workplace in particular remains significantly high.Miltos Pavlou, the survey’s programme manager at the FRA, told the  that the results hinted at “a strong claim of trans people to participate in the labour market and in everyday life, and to be protected from discrimination”, as well as more openness by trans people about their gender identity.Like most respondents across Europe, people in the UK who say the situation has deteriorated blame “negative public discourse by politicians andor political parties”, as well as “lack of enforcement of existing law and policies” as the main contributing factors.New legislation introducing compulsory relationships education for primary school pupils and relationships and sex education for secondary pupils is due to come into force in England from September 2020.Bradlow hailed the introduction of the new regulations as a historic moment: “A whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBTQ people and same-sex relationships, but also celebrate and offer support on issues that young LGBTQ people face. Just think of the change that inclusive education will bring to the lives of so many young people.”The FRA survey’s full results can be accessed through their online data explorer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse.

I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong.

I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance. Let young people enjoy being teenagers so we can enjoy adulthood.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, the people featured recommend these Instagram accounts: @bodyposipanda @i_weigh @mattzhaig @crazyheadcomics @muslimgirl @the_indian_feminist @privtoprog @Ayat_Zaman"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289604.1593185836!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a do we know yet where abroad we can go on summer holiday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Imagine if you went to Greece and all was rosy as your plane took off but while you were lounging on a Cretan beach, a spike in Covid-19 infections was reported there.’ File photograph: Getty Are we any the wiser on whether we can holiday\u0026nbspoverseas this summer?Well, to borrow a couple of lines from Dr Seuss, we are all still “in a most useless place, the waiting place” and when it comes to “the places you’ll go”, we still don’t really know.What? I thought there were big developments this week?Yes and no. But mostly no. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has outlined a map of sorts for the resumption of foreign travel, but the reality is we still don’t know whether we are coming or going or what’s going to be happening in the weeks ahead. Or at least we don’t know very much more than we did at the start of the month.What did the Taoiseach say this week?He announced that from July 9th there will be air bridges between Ireland and some other countries and people will be able to travel to and from those countries without having to undergo a 14-day quarantine and with the permission of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The list of countries will be co-ordinated at European Union level.And where are these countries?Oh we don’t know. We won’t know what countries are on the so-called Green List for some time yet and maybe not until just before July 9th. The Taoiseach also said he needed “to caution people, that list of countries will be reviewed and it may change every two weeks. So we may see it getting longer but if a country ends up having a second wave or there are spikes then they may be taken off that list of countries.”So how can I plan my holiday?You can’t actually, or at least not with any degree of certainty.Can you guess what countries are likely to be one the list?Ah yeah. We can always try, although to be honest there probably will not be that many in the first instance. Travel experts and people close to those who stalk the corridors of power have suggested that Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece and Croatia are likely to be among the EU countries that feature. Other countries including Finland and the Baltic states also have low levels of virus transmission today and would most likely be accommodated also. But as they are not primary, or even secondary, holiday destinations for Irish people the level of traffic to such destinations is likely to be small.What criteria will be used to decide the Green List?According to Government officials, the precise criteria is still being worked on but key elements are likely to be the reproduction rate of the virus in each country, level of community transmission and numbers hospitalised, and mortality rate along with measures that are in place in countries to contain the virus.Will the United Kingdom be on the list?This is a tricky one in an Irish context. Had you asked this question a couple of weeks ago, the answer would have been a definite maybe as officials were humming and hawing about allowing resumption of unfettered travel between here and there. It would have been deemed politically wise, not least because of the common travel area, to do that.But attitudes on this side of the Irish Sea have hardened in recent days and the chances of the UK being included on any good-to-go list in the near future is pretty much zero. That means people who travel from the UK to the Republic will be forced to spend two weeks in quarantine while a travel advisory against going to the UK from the Republic is likely to remain in place. On Thursday the Taoiseach said if a decision was to be made on list of accepted countries today, the Government would not be removing the 14-day quarantine requirement on travel between Ireland and the UK.Is that extreme given they are our closest neighbour and huge market for our tourism?If there was any doubts in official circles about leaving the UK out in the cold, they would have been removed this week after images of overcrowding and general chaos on the beaches around Bournemouth started circulating. The celebrations around Anfield after Liverpool won their first league title in 30 years will not have done much to create the impression that Britain has the whole social distancing thing under control either.Hang on. Isn’t Northern Ireland in the UK? What about that?That is a very good question. Of course Northern Ireland is part of the UK but it is also part of the island of Ireland and so it is exempt from any of the restrictions that are imposed on Britain, which means people from Northern Ireland are able to travel freely to the Republic.So can I fly from London to Belfast, then take the train to Dublin?Yes. And there is absolutely no way that channel of entry can be closed unless the new government feels inclined to rip up the Belfast Agreement as one source said on Friday. And that is not going to happen.Remind me again what the restrictions are now? Well the Department of Foreign Affairs is advising against all non-essential travel while everyone arriving in the State at its airports or ports must fill in a passenger locator form to allow authorities to check if iniduals are self-isolating for 14 days as advised and for contact tracing purposes.What happens if I don’t want to do that?People who do not fill out the passenger locator form or who provide false details can face a fine of €2,500 or a prison term of six months.Could I take a chance and go to a country\u0026nbspnot on the Green List?You could. As it stands there are plenty of flights to countries that are not likely to be on any list in the near future. You can also fly to the United States today – or at least there are planes leaving here and flying there. But does that mean you can fly to those countries? Not really. First, if you do it will be at your own risk and invalidate any travel insurance policy you have. When it comes to the United States, that country has barred entry to Irish citizens. But while the planes might be leaving Ireland you have an Irish passport so will not be allowed on it. Oh, and when you come back you will have to do the quarantine thing also which, after what we have all been through, does not sound like a lot of fun.What was that you said about travel insurance?If you travel to any country against official advice then you automatically invalidate any travel insurance you might have . If you’re travelling within the European Union and you have a European Health Insurance Card then you’ll be treated in the whatever country you are in as a citizen of that country. But if you are the victim of a robbery or any other crime or need to be repatriated or suffer any other mishap you’re on your own.Okay, back up. Varadkar said the Green List was a movable feast. What if a country is taken off the list while I am there?What, indeed. Imagine if you went to Greece and all was rosy as your plane took off but while you were lounging on a Cretan beach, a spike in Covid-19 infections was reported there. Under the as yet unwritten rules, Greece might be whisked off the list and you would have to quarantine upon your return, if you could get home. Government officials are working at how to square this circle and are said to be struggling to see how this might be managed to everyone’s benefit.Why would anyone travel with such doubt hanging over the trip?There is still considerable confusion and mounting concern about spikes in Covid-19 in other countries. So many people may decide that it might be as well off giving up on overseas travel this summer. And the Government would probably be delighted by this outcome. Why not just say no non-essential overseas travel until October?Because travel is a two-way street. The Government in general and the Department of Transport and Tourism in particular is walking a thin line here. They have to factor in public health concerns and the economy. There is a tourism sector here that is worth billions and an aviation sector on its knees. The Government is keen to allow visitors come, safely, to this country but not so keen to see many thousands of people leaving and rubbing shoulders with potentially infected people overseas before coming home and bringing the virus with them.Will opening our borders to travel not increase the risk of the virus spiking here?\u0026nbspIt will and the Government is aware of the dangers of importing new cases of Covid-19 into parts of Ireland that have been clear for weeks if the doors are opened to overseas tourists too quickly. “That would be the nightmare scenario,” according to one official.But airlines are flying, right?Well, they certainly have plans to and the charge to take to the air again is being led by Ryanair. It said it has seen a “surge” of bookings from Irish holiday makers for July and August with people seeking to fly to the sun. It is, however, worth pointing out that while the airline talks about a surge in new bookings, many of the seats on flights bound to Spain, Portugal and Italy this summer will have been sold to Irish families who had plans in place long before the pandemic hit.If restrictions remain and flights take off, will people get their money back?No. Under the rules if a plane takes off and a passenger follows official guidance and avoids non-essential travel overseas then they are regarded as a no-show and are not entitled to any money back.And what will travel look like when it restarts?Passengers will be asked to wear face masks for a start. DAA, the State company responsible for Cork and Dublin airports, says public access to terminals will be limited to passengers, travellers will have to maintain the 2m social distance and there will be constant reminders about hand washing. DAA has installed more than 960 hand sanitisers in Dublin and Cork and there will be hundreds of Plexiglass screens at close-contact points. DAA has also said it will regularly deep clean and disinfect all hard surfaces, including trays, handrails and self-service kiosks, while paying close attention to places where passengers congregate. Masks are likely to be a requirement on board planes.Will air bridges apply to other parts of the world?Things are moving slowly and travelling within the EU is probably the best Irish people can hope for in the weeks ahead. Places like Dubai may also open for business in early phases of the resumption of travel.What about the US? Are we likely to see an air bridge to that country?That certainly seems unlikely in the short term. Covid-19 is not under control there and its leading public health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, indicated last week that that US restrictions on international travel could remain in place for months and perhaps until a vaccine is developed. And on Friday holiday company TUI announced it had cancelled all holidays to Florida for its Irish customers up to the end of November “due to the ongoing uncertainty around international travel restrictions and the unprecedented impact of Covid-19”.

Illustration by Michael Viney “I was trying to remember today how the colours are banded on the puffin’s curious triangular bill: was it red-yellow-blue or blue-yellow-red? So I descended the northern cliff for a closer look at them.“I was not put off by its precipitous plunge and the boiling of the sea below, but made my way down cautiously, kicking my boots well in at every step. At about a hundred feet down I found myself at the flight-level of the puffins.“These gay little auks fly in wide ellipses between cliff and sea, seeming without purpose and indefinitely, but it is not easy to follow an inidual puffin for their whole circuit of a teeming merry-go-round.“They were flying so close to me today, within a yard or so, that I could see them glance at me as they passed. Their flight is quicker than one thinks for all its apparent whirring clumsiness, so that trying to note the permutation of their bill colours was like trying to read the title on a revolving gramophone record...”That was me, a mere half-century ago, a solitary young eccentric camped on a Blasket island and pursuing this trivial and risky impulse. Why not stay on the clifftop, lying among the sea-pinks, to watch them perch outside their burrows in the evening sun? I must have forgotten my binoculars. Puffins, one of many of the world’s declining seabirds, are receiving much more necessary and serious attention. Like others – petrels and shearwaters, for example – who visit land only to breed, nesting in burrows and crevices and using darkness to dodge their predators, they invite challenging questions. How many are there, where do they go in winter, and what threatens their populations?The latest report on our breeding seabirds, from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, speaks of the “cryptic breeding ecology” of this 20 per cent of burrow-nesters and waits on the results of ongoing surveys.In the last big census attempt, Seabird 2000, many Irish islands proved too hard to land on or were beyond the capacity to organise. Puffins, in particular, were nesting on dangerously steep slopes and inaccessible clifftops. Playing tapes of recorded calls brought responses from most of the “apparently occupied burrows”, numbering more than 16,000.Since then, more intensive and hi-tech surveys by researchers at University College Cork suggest that some population figures for burrow-nesters have been gross underestimates. UCC’s Gavin Arneill and a fieldwork team found almost 4,000 pairs of storm petrels nesting on High Island, off Connemara, compared with the Seabird estimate of 22.UCC’s Dr Mark Jessop, an Australian zoologist, has worked with colleagues to track the winter travels of Irish puffins, their bright summer colours dulled or discarded. Tagging dispersing birds with GPS locators, he found puffins from Skellig Michael flying the Atlantic as far as Canada and Greenland to feed on shoals of oil-rich capelin.In 2017 came an international study, led by Oxford University and involving UCC, that had tracked 270 birds from 13 puffin colonies in North America, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Ireland. While US puffins migrated several hundred kilometres at most, birds from Ireland travelled up to 4,700km on return flights across the Atlantic.This, Jessop says, could leave the puffins too tired to breed when they arrive, barely able to lay one egg and forage food for a single chick. This could help to explain falling numbers at many Irish colonies.Floating on the tidesAnother recent study, by UCC researchers and the Zoological Society of London, found that puffins from colonies at the Saltee islands, Co Wexford, use strong tidal currents to float, rather than fly, between areas where they could e most successfully for sand eels. This saves them substantial energy.On the Great Saltee Island – a special area of conservation for birds – predation by rats has reduced breeding puffins from 2,000 to 50 birds. On the more remote and rat-free puffin cliffs, the main predators of eggs and chicks are the great black-backed gulls, breeding elsewhere on the island.Storm petrels and shearwaters return from fishing to feed their chicks under cover of darkness. But puffins bring beakfuls of sand-eels to the burrow by day and roost offshore at night. The single chick, however, takes its crucial first journey to the sea under darkness, having been left alone to get hungry.A witness to this was the Welsh ornithologist Ronald Lockley. In his classic Letters from Stockholm (1947), he told of measuring the period of the parents’ desertion by pushing matchsticks upright in the mouths of marked burrows.At length, in late July or August, several days after the last flattening of the matchsticks, the chicks emerged at night “to blunder onwards and downwards until they could at last flutter over the cliffs to the sea”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revolt"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Damien EagersPA WireThe make-up of the new Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Green Party Cabinet will be keenly watched, with work not yet fully completed on the exact structures of the government departments the new batch of ministers will occupy. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will each have six full Cabinet ministers and the Greens will have three. Each party will also have a so-called “super junior” minister. A super junior is a junior minister who sits at the Cabinet table but does not have voting rights. Office of the TánaisteMr Martin will become taoiseach and the Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar will take over the position of tánaiste. Mr Varadkar is tipped to take over a beefed-up Department of Jobs, potentially taking the tourism element of the Department of Transport, which will be reconfigured. He will also have an Office of the Tánaiste in Government Buildings. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is set to remain in position with Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath taking over the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Fine Gael is also expected to hold on to the Department of Foreign Affairs, with Simon Coveney remaining in situ in Iveagh House. Which party gets the Department of Health was not yet clear on Friday night, but it is expected that Simon Harris, the current senior minister in that department, will remain in Cabinet. It is understood that Fine Gael will hold on to the Department of Justice. Outgoing Minister for Business Heather Humphreys is also seen as likely to remain at Cabinet. Those tipped for promotion from within the Fine Gael ranks are Meath East TD Helen McEntee, the outgoing Minister for European Affairs, a junior minister slot, and Galway West TD Hildegarde Naughton, who chaired the Oireachtas all party committee on climate change in the last Dáil. Internal Fine Gael speculation is that either Ms McEntee or Ms Naughton will take a full Cabinet position, with the other taking a super junior slot. Fianna Fáil will take the Department of Housing, and Darragh O’Brien, the party’s housing spokesman, is tipped for that slot, although Offaly TD Barry Cowen was also previously housing spokesman. Some sources said Fianna Fail was in line for the Department of Agriculture but others said Fine Gael may hold on to it. Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary will hope for a substantial portfolio too and it was not clear on Friday night if a full Cabinet post for the higher education sector will be created as Mr Martin had previously promised. There was intense speculation within Fianna Fáil on Friday night on the future of Dublin Bay South TD Jim O’Callaghan, with suggestions he could be left out of Cabinet if Fine Gael takes the justice portfolio as expected. Fianna Fáil will take the position of government chief whip, with Dublin West TD Jack Chambers mentioned in connection with that job. Fine Gael will be allocated the position of deputy whip and the Greens will get assistant whip. The Department of Rural Affairs is slated for abolition, although it is not clear where its responsibilities will be transferred to. Rotating attorney generalMr Martin on Friday night confirmed that the position of attorney general will also be rotated between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, in tandem with the position of taoiseach rotating. Galway East TD Anne Rabbitte and Kerry TD Norma Foley are also mentioned as potential Cabinet or super-junior appointments. Education spokesman Thomas Byrne will also be hoping for a position. It is not yet clear which parties will take the Department of Education – although Green Party leader Catherine Martin is linked with it and was education spokeswoman in the last Dáil – and Social Protection. The Greens are also linked to a newly-created Department of Children, Disability and Equality, with Dublin West TD Roderic O’Gorman seen as one of the frontrunners for the third Green Cabinet position after Mr Ryan and Ms Martin. It is understood, however, that responsibility for the direct provision system will remain within the Department of Justice. A new Department of Climate, Energy, Transport and Natural Resources will be created, although its name is expected to be tidied up. Mr Ryan is widely expected to get this job. A super-junior minister for roads will also be appointed to balance out the Greens but it is not clear yet if Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will take this. Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy is not expected to be a senior or junior minister and is instead tipped to take on a new party role linking the Fine Gael organisation and the Fine Gael parliamentary party.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289644.1593207962!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"developer wants indemnity in exchange for 1m to fix faults residents told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimonsridge: Investigations  revealed ‘a significant number of fire safety deficiencies with workmanship and building materials’. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe developer of hundreds of Dublin apartments affected by building defects is withholding a €1 million contribution to fixing the faults, and demanding an indemnity from future litigation before paying any money over, owners of the apartments have been told.Simonsridge in Sandyford in south Dublin, which consists of 632 apartments, was built in 2006 by developer Shannon Homes. Issues first came to light last year after a preliminary investigation uncovered a range of potential fire safety issues in common areas, as well as other structural and fire-stopping elements.According to correspondence sent to apartment owners at Simonsridge in March of this year Shannon Homes had agreed, following an “intensive negotiation process”, to contribute €1 million towards the fire remediation process at the apartments.The development’s owners management company (OMC) – a legal entity composed of all the apartment owners in a development, which is in charge of running apartment blocks – told owners: “This is one million euros of hard cash that will be handed to the OMC with immediate effect, to apply to our fire remediation project.”According to the letter, it was hoped at the time that the contribution from Shannon Homes, in addition to a €2,000 levy placed on all apartment owners would “be sufficient to make all of our apartments fire-safe, and to make all of our apartments sellable”. Some works, funded by the levy, are already underway at the apartments.However, in an email sent to all apartment owners on Monday night, Simonsridge OMC wrote that it is “encountering significant difficulty finalising matters with Shannon Homes”.“Specifically, Shannon Homes now require that 100 per cent of OMC members vote to accept an indemnity to Shannon Homes with respect to any future litigation from owners in consideration of the payment of the €1 million,” the email states.“As you will no doubt appreciate, this request is unrealistic as none of us knows what the future might hold in respect to our development. It is also a major deviation from the agreement made,” the directors of the OMC told residents.Neither Shannon Homes nor the OMC responded to requests for comment made a number of times this week.The March correspondence to the apartment owners also reveals the terms of a deal which it is claimed had been struck between the developer and the OMC.Common areasAs part of the agreement, a Shannon Homes subsidiary involved in the development would be “allowed to proceed with their strike-off application”, which apartment owners had objected to. Common areas in the development which were still owned by the developer would be transferred to the OMC. The apartment owners would also give an undertaking not to make a submission to An Bórd Pleanála regarding a nearby project currently being developed by Shannon Homes, the 496-unit Taylor’s Lane project.Concerns about the development were initially raised last year after a preliminary investigation uncovered a range of potential fire-safety issues. These issues were passed on to Dublin Fire Brigade, which in turn asked Shannon Homes to undertake a full investigation at the scheme.Later investigations on a sample of apartments revealed “a significant number of fire-safety deficiencies with workmanship and building materials”. A report on the development found that a fire could spread and breach protected hallways within apartments in less than 30 minutes.Pipes passing through compartment levels of apartments were not fitted with fire-rated collars and “internal protected hallways do not extend to the underside of the concrete slab above”.The cost of remediating the issues was estimated at up to €14,000 for each apartment, with up to another €30,000 for remedies to each of 32 common areas, meaning repairs could cost up to €10 million. However, the report noted that significant cost savings could likely be achieved.In November, apartment owners at the Sandyford development voted to accept a €2,000 levy per apartment, to be imposed in two tranches. They have been told that they face a second levy to fix the defects if Shannon Homes does not come forward with a contribution.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289799.1593202890!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government considering purchase of military jet aircraft","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t    Six RAF Typhoons   headed towards counties Derry and Donegal to intercept these Russian Tupolev aircraft  on March 7th, forcing them to alter course. Photograph: RAFPA WireThe Government is considering the purchase of military jet aircraft that would have the capacity to intercept high-altitude planes and fully police Irish skies. A new five-year Defence Forces investment strategy document has said that “future projects at a preplanning stage” include the potential for “air combat interceptors”. Such aircraft are designed to scramble quickly when there is a need to intercept unwelcome or unidentified planes which could include foreign military or hijacked airliners. Although no decisions have been made on whether to pursue such high-end military hardware, it would require a major financial commitment potentially running into hundreds of millions of euro.Expensive ground radar equipment would also be required to detect encroaching traffic in Irish airspace.“Consideration of Air Combat Interceptors would be dependent on additional funding,” the Defence Forces – Equipment Development Plan 2020-24 document, published on Friday, states. High-speed aircraftUnlike most EU countries, Ireland does not have the capacity to fully secure its airspace by intercepting high-speed aircraft. A Defence Forces spokesman said “such a capability is being kept under review, and is based on threat assessment, but budget has not been allocated for this at this time. Such an aircraft would be capable of policing all airborne craft in Irish sovereign airspace, particularly those that are fast moving.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Defence said it is a “proposal that needs to be developed and scoped out”. “The assessment would consider the demands that may be made of such interceptors and the military capabilities it would be expected to be able to supply, together with the associated technical specification and capability requirements.“This utility would have to be assessed against the significant investment of public funds, in respect of the initial investment and ongoing operational costs.”The Air Corps has previously used both the De Havilland Vampire, a British jet fighter, and the French-designed Fouga Magister jet trainer aircraft. It also continues to operate the Ministerial Air Transport Service jet aircraft however, the type of plane under consideration would represent a major upgrade in technology. Earlier this year Maj Gen Ralph James, who retired as head of the Air Corps in 2015, said the State would need about 16 jet fighters with three crews each to implement a full air-defence capability. CertificationHe said each pilot would need up to 400 hours behind the controls of the jet before earning fast-response certification. A jet programme of this kind would likely cost well in excess of €1 billion.Any such cost would impact the decision-making process – particularly given the cost to the State of the Covid-19 crisis. However, the question of airspace security is not academic. Last March, a number of Russian Tupolev TU-95 “Bear” bombers, also used as long-range maritime patrol planes, entered Irish airspace.

Meanwhile, many countries that would make it onto the list were not the countries that people typically visited for holidays.The incidence of Covid-19 in Ireland was low and falling, he said, but this was not the case in many other countries. The State had the third-greatest fall in incidence of Covid-19 in Europe over the past 14 days, behind Finland and Estonia, according to figures presented at the briefing.Officials expressed concern about an increase in new cases linked to foreign travel – 13 over the past two weeks, or 6 per cent of the total. The countries involved included India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the US, the UK, Spain and Portugal.Dr Holohan said a “green list” would have to be based on “trustworthy” and verifiable information shared at European level about incidence of coronavirus in different countries.Public health messagingDr Holohan also expressed concern that the public health message was not getting through to some people, commenting that he had travelled home on Thursday evening via Dublin’s Grand Canal: “A lot of people were wedged in beside each other as if nothing was going on.”A further three deaths of patients with Covid-19 were reported by Nphet on Friday. This leaves the total number of Covid-19 deaths in the Republic at 1,730.Nphet also reported another 11 confirmed cases of the disease, bringing to 25,414 the total number of confirmed cases since the outbreak began here at the end of February.Transmission of the virus in the community continues to be at a very low level, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chair of the Nphet epidemiological modelling advisory group.All the indicators of the spread of the disease in Ireland are very positive and stable, or even in decline, Prof Nolan said.The average number of new cases has declined to nine per day from 15-20 a week earlier, while the number of people in hospital as a result of the virus has declined from 40 to just in excess of 20.Not only had cases not increased since Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were eased on June 8th, but they have declined, he said.However, Prof Nolan expressed concern about the rising proportion of young people affected by the virus under-40s now account for more than half of all new cases.One further coronavirus-related death and four new cases were reported in Northern Ireland on Friday.Tracker appMeanwhile, the Health Service Executive published design and data privacy documents on Friday ahead of the launch of its Covid-19 tracker app.The smartphone app, which is designed to aid the contact tracing process, will become available next week.Minister for Health Simon Harris announced €2.4 million in funding for international clinical trials of potential new treatments for Covid-19, with patients to be recruited from next week. The Government has formally signed up to the World Health Organisation’s Solidarity research collaboration. The trial has to date recruited more than 5,000 patients across 35 countries. Another 100 countries are awaiting approval to participate in the trial.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289824.1593205821!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il s miche%C3%A1l martin to be elected taoiseach after greens back deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin after announcing his party members voted for the programme for government. Photograph: Damien EagersPA The Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is set to be elected taoiseach with the support of Fine Gael and the Green Party when the Dáil meets this morning, after the three parties announced their members had voted to endorse the coalition deal last night.Mr Martin will later today form a government with representatives from all three parties, announcing his Cabinet to the Dáil before travelling to Dublin Castle where the new ministers will receive their seals of office from President Michael D Higgins and then hold their first meeting.The way was cleared last night for the historic coalition between the two age-old rivals of Irish politics and the Green Party when the results of ballots of the respective memberships were announced.While Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil comfortably endorsed the programme for government as expected, the Green vote – the last to be announced in an evening of political drama – delivered an unexpectedly thumping majority in favour of entering government.The result of the Green vote was announced after 8.30pm, following a lengthy count which began at lunchtime. It showed that 1,435 members voted in favour of the coalition deal, with 457 casting their ballots against the proposal – a winning margin of 76 per cent to 24 per cent, comfortably ahead of the two-thirds majority required by the party’s constitution.Welcoming the result, party leader Eamon Ryan said there was “work to be done”. He looked forward to a “better economic system, one that really looks after all our people and looks after nature, because without nature, there is no security for any of us”.Green deputy leader Catherine Martin appealed to party members who opposed the deal to come together with its supporters. “I know many Green members will be sceptical of serving in a government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael,” she said. “We will ensure it will be a government of mutual respect.”Earlier, following the announcement that Fine Gael members and elected representatives had overwhelmingly backed the coalition, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his party had a “strong mandate” to enter government after the vote.“Fine Gael is going to enter a third term of government, and this new coalition, united and strong, is up for the challenge,” he said.Mr Varadkar will vacate the office this morning on the election of Mr Martin, but return as taoiseach in December 2022, under the terms of the agreement between the three parties.Mr Martin described the vote by Fianna Fáil to form a government with its old rivals as “unique” and “historic”. There had been a “very energetic debate” at all levels of the party. “I think we are much the better from that exercise and from that energy,” he said. He thanked those who campaigned for a “no” vote saying it was done in a “very respectful, very democratic” manner.The Dáil will meet at 10.30 this morning in the National Convention Centre in Dublin which is large enough to allow for social distancing among TDs. Once Mr Martin is elected, the House will be adjourned to allow him travel to Áras an Uachtaráin where he will be formally appointed by the President. He will then travel to Government Buildings where the Cabinet will be selected before returning to the Dáil to introduce his ministers and seek Dáil approval for the appointments.SeanadIt is also expected Mr Martin will announce his 11 nominees to the Seanad – as agreed with Mr Ryan and Mr Varadkar – which will enable the Upper House to meet on Monday and pass a vote renewing the Offences Against the State Act. Unless such a vote is passed by midnight on Monday, some sections of the anti-terror and anti-gangland legislation will lapse.Opposition parties focussed their criticisms on the Greens.Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said people had “voted for change in the general election they voted for a fresh start and for a new beginning.“Faced with the prospect of a government of change, the two old parties have come together to circle the wagons to exclude Sinn Féin, and they are using the Green Party as a fig leaf to do this,” he said.People Before Profit said the Greens had “abandoned any project for radical change on climate, housing, health and economic justice”. The party said it would hold a protest outside the convention centre today.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289826.1593206714!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord immovable object beds down with irresistible force","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan announces that the party had voted in support of the proposed programme for government. Photograph: Sam BoalRollingNews.iePeople would have laughed at such an outrageous suggestion when Fianna Fáil lay in tatters and its future looked bleak. No chance, Micheál.And if that notion wasn’t far-fetched enough, the idea of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael going into government together was simply inconceivable.And here they are now: the immovable object bedding down with the irresistible force. So eager to go hopping into power together they could barely wait to get permission to do so from a niche small party which wasn’t even around when they were in their pomp.But now they are together. The deed is done.Friday marked a momentous day in the Irish history, a day when the political world turned on its axis and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael put aside almost 100 years of bitterness and enmity to work together in government.Will they or won’t they? That was the question all day on Friday as party members voted on the next step. The irony of it all was that the answer to that big question wasn’t ever in doubt where Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were concerned. Instead, it was the Green party’s decision which was keenly awaited.Roundly endorsedThe Taoiseach was able to announce by late afternoon that Fine Gael was aboard, and in a big way. A few hours later, soon-to-be taoiseach Micheál Martin announced that the membership of Fianna Fáil had also roundly endorsed the programme for government.It was just the Greens left to declare and despite a week of speculation over whether the party would back a decision to go into government, they too opted to go into power with a sizeable majority in favour.And the alliance everyone thought could never be done until that cohort grew old and a younger generation couldn’t really feel what the fight was about in the first place, happened.Just like that. With a smiling leader of Fine Gael and a smiling leader of Fianna Fail leading the way.And guess what? Outside of the irredeemable anoraks and distracted hacks competing to tweet each nuance of nothingness from a day when the tectonic plates refused to shift for the sake of atmosphere, this so-called seismic event passed off with little fuss.The general mood outside of the committed and mildly curious was one of “What took yis so long?”So the old order is gone.To be replaced with what? A new old order?Not if the Green Party has its way. Their buy-in facilitated the new dispensation on this “Friday when we look to the future”, said leader Eamon Ryan, who looked exhausted but extremely relieved when the result of the party’s vote was revealed by video conference.Meanwhile, for the older observers, the sight of the leader of Fianna Fáil, on the cusp of becoming taoiseach, making his pre-elevation speech in the ballroom of the Burlington Hotel gave pause for less than reassuring memories. Micheál Martin and colleagues welcoming this new era from the shiny surrounds of the Burlo, scene of many an Fianna Fáil beano back in the day.And now they are back. The Phoenix Fáil party.He wasn’t counting his chickens before the Greens gave their imprimatur to his three-legged government. Friday was just “a working day” he said, refusing to get ahead of things and give himself a big welcome.‘Fort Knox’All day reports were coming from the Green camp that the vote was very tight. At one point in the afternoon reports of legal challenges halting the count swept Leinster House. But, as Roderic O’Gorman pointed out on the evening news, “Our count centre is a bit like Fort Knox at the moment – there is no information getting out.”So wild speculation filled the vacuum.Which meant that Micheál wasn’t going to get too excited. The lack of a result “has a kind of impact on my mood so I’m just taking it handy”.A clue as to how things were going in Greenland was smuggled out by TD Ossian Smyth at about 7.30pm when he tweeted a smiley-face emoji. A heartening (or worrying) indication of things to come in this administration.The Taoiseach looked very relaxed when he communicated his party’s result on the steps of their Mount Street headquarters. And while he wasn’t giving anything away about who would get the prize jobs in cabinet and at minister of state level, he remarked quietly as he was walking back towards Government Buildings: “I’ll be striking a blow for equality.”Could this mean big roles for the Three H’s – Heather Humphreys, Helen McEntee and Hildegard Naughton? We saw Hildegard, the Galway-based TD who is tipped for office, driving into Leinster House in the late evening when the place was near deserted.At this point, the rumour mill was in overdrive. The non-information from Fort Knox was that the result was on “a knife edge” and people in the Green Party hoping for a Yes vote were very worried.Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, had a complete tally operation in full flow in the Burlo and the word and percentages from Dublin 4 was that a return to government was very much in order.Finally, a delighted Micheál Martin, keeping a lid on his emotions, was able to declare: “ I’m delighted that the recommendation that I gave to the party membership recommending this programme for government has been so overwhelming endorsed by the party membership.”Leo had gone off to check out his new offices.The Dáil meets on Saturday morning in the Convention Centre on the banks of the Liffey in Dublin’s docklands when Micheál Martin will, after decade of effort, eventually get his heart’s desire.The Green Party is all set for action. Deputy leader Catherine Martin showed a fine aptitude for ministerial waffle when she spoke about “a job of work to be done” and their intention “to hit the ground running”.Eamon Ryan was subdued but happy looking. “I am proud of our country. I’m proud of our democratic institutions that have been here for 100 years,” he said. As for his work and the party’s work: “Never ever give up. Never give up.”Micheál Martin will agree on that. He never gave up either and now he is to be taoiseach.But will Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael truly get on? Or is one of them the black widow in the relationship.Which of them will devour their mate?This politics lark has suddenly become very interesting.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Many were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Thousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th.

The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"americas covid spike shows second wave could bring second lockdown","story":"The line isn’t doing what it’s meant to do. After several months of mild up and down, the Covid case chart for Texas is surging. Hospitals are filling up. Governor Greg Abbott has called a halt to the state’s reopening and the hunt is on for stadiums and empty halls to house patients. Texas has already been through a lockdown and come out the other side, but both its hospitalisations and the proportion of positive test results have doubled in the last three weeks – the opposite of what should happen as test capacity expands. In the US overall, after six weeks falling or flat-lining, new cases are now approaching the highs of over 30,000 a day last seen in April.Despite warning signs, an almost mystical notion has taken hold, suggesting that Covid-19 has entered some sort of “natural decline”. It is in precipitous decline in the UK, after all – so much so that its absence may thwart Oxford’s vaccine trial. Life is slowly edging towards normality and public spaces are filling up, from park loungers to protesters, beachgoers and rioters. Surely the worst is over?Sadly, the fact that we are bored of this whole virus thing doesn’t actually mean we are safe. There is very little compelling evidence to suggest we are anywhere near immunity. Survey testing has so far found that antibodies are present in about 5 per cent of most populations. This may underestimate our resilience, given that not everyone needs antibodies to fight off Covid, but it is a long way from herd immunity.This shouldn’t surprise anyone following the data. In the last few weeks, there have been surges in many places where the epidemic had been in stasis or decline, such as Singapore, South Korea, Israel, China and the US, where the growth is concentrated in Texas, Arizona, Florida and California. In most of these cases outside the US, authorities have got on top of the new clusters quickly, imposed local lockdowns and run intense contact-tracing operations to root out transmission, avoiding anything big enough to be called a “second wave”. But the virus’s capacity to generate a second wave should not be in doubt. The only uncertainty is whether we will spot and snuff out new clusters fast enough to avoid it.So far, we have found only two ways to contain fresh outbreaks. The first and by far the least costly is contact-tracing and isolation. It can be done manually without a tracing app, but it requires lightning-fast reactions and extreme efficiency. In order to detect new clusters before they appear in hospitals, we should be mass-testing constantly and monitoring in new ways, such as watching local Google search numbers for terms like “Covid” or “anosmia”. There is no halfway house, however. If authorities don’t get an early grip on a cluster, one super-spreader at a single social event can set off a second wave. Given the enormous deficiencies of the UK’s test, trace and isolate programme, I am not hopeful.That leaves us with the second containment method: lockdowns. Few policies can claim to have been as expensive and isive as the Covid lockdown. There are two extremes in the debate. One side claims lockdowns are an intolerably expensive measure that don’t even work. At the other end, ministers say there is no trade-off between the economy and public health and that the lockdown has protected both. Both sides are wrong.Lockdowns work. Take US data and compare mostly “closed” states with mostly “open” ones. In the locked down states, new daily cases have fallen from a peak of about 17,000 in April to a few thousand this month. The number of Covid patients in hospital has fallen from just over 10,000 at the start of June to under 7,000 now. In the mostly open states, by contrast, new daily cases are over 20,000 and still rising. In June, hospitalised cases rose from 20,500 to nearly 21,000 and are still going up. There are counter-examples – California is locked down, yet LA cases are rising, perhaps due to crowded, multi-generational households in poor areas. But this is an exception to the rule.The raw US data is backed up by an array of studies. A UC Berkeley paper estimated that lockdowns prevented 530 million infections across China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the US. An Institut Pasteur study in France found that its lockdown reduced the virus’s reproductive rate by 77 per cent. A University of Southampton study found that a combination of isolation and lockdown prevented a 67-fold increase in cases in Wuhan. An Imperial study of 11 European countries found that lockdowns had “a large effect” on cutting transmission. I could go on. Those who pour scorn on the very notion that the UK could have suffered 500,000 deaths without a lockdown clearly don’t understand the power of exponentials.However, even if lockdowns work, sceptics may be right that they are unbearable. They are deadly for the economy and, in fiscal terms alone, a lockdown is a wholly unsustainable policy. Take into account the human cost from rising unemployment, closed schools, delays to non-Covid treatment and the sundering of family ties and you have a ghastly epidemic of human misery. All of this has led to a new consensus: that a lockdown must never, ever, be imposed again, or that it simply cannot be reintroduced without imposing a police state. But even this seeming certainty melts in the face of terrible possibilities. If the winter brings with it a new wave that overwhelms hospitals and we start seeing footage of patients turned away at reception desks as they gasp for air, as happened in Lombardy, you can bet lockdown will be on the menu again.Before that happens (if it happens), the stage is set for the great experiment. The top priority must be to get the tracing system working. But even if our Government is somehow incapable of that, it may yet find a set of distancing policies that keeps virus deaths at a low enough level without shutting everything down. Perhaps there is a balance to be struck, involving a mix of mask-wearing, better care-home procedures, loosening rules for the young before the old, keeping people outdoors and planning ways to do so in winter.Thankfully, our first Covid wave is now ebbing. But Texas shows that second waves can happen. So let’s enjoy the release from lockdown, but if we want to avoid another, it is going to take more than wishful thinking.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"archbishop canterbury says church needs reconsider portraying","story":"The Archbishop of Canterbury has urged the Church to reconsider portraying Jesus as white and to think “very carefully” about its controversial monuments in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests.The Most Rev Justin Welby suggested that statues in Canterbury Cathedral are going to be looked at very carefully to see if they should be there.He added that some will have to come down but that it is not his decision and that monuments would be put in context.The Cathedral later confirmed that all of its items are under review to ensure that any connected with slavery, colonialism or contentious figures from other historic periods are displayed with clear contextual information to avoid “any sense of aggrandisement”.The  also understands that Cathedral officials are also reviewing its range of depictions of Jesus Christ.The Archbishop of Canterbury, who is the most senior figure in the Church of England, made the comments on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.He has said that justice is crucial to forgiveness, and stressed a need to learn from the past so that it is not repeated in the future.Asked if people should forgive the trespasses of people immortalised in the form of statues, rather than tearing them down, he responded: We can only do that if we\u0027ve got justice, which means the statue needs to be put in context. Some will have to come down.Some names will have to change,” he said. “I mean, the church, goodness me, you know, you just go around Canterbury Cathedral, there\u0027s monuments everywhere, or Westminster Abbey, and we\u0027re looking at all that, and some will have to come down.But yes, there can be forgiveness, I hope and pray as we come together, but only if there\u0027s justice.If we change the way we behave now, and say this was then and we learned from that, and change how we\u0027re going to be in the future, internationally, as well.Pressed on whether he was saying statues will be taken down in the cathedral, he added: No, I didn\u0027t say that. I very carefully didn\u0027t say that.He said it is not his decision, and told the programme: We\u0027re going to be looking very carefully and putting them in context and seeing if they all should be there… The question arises.

You go into churches (around the world) and you don\u0027t see a white Jesus.“You see a black Jesus, a Chinese Jesus, a Middle Eastern Jesus - which is of course the most accurate - you see a Fijian Jesus.”With the growing surge in support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which has sparked global protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, a number of petitions have emerged demanding controversial monuments in the UK are taken down.In Bristol, a statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and dumped in the harbour, while the figure of slave owner Robert Milligan was taken down from its plinth at West India Quay in London\u0027s Docklands.Last week, the governing body of Oxford\u0027s Oriel College expressed their wish to remove a statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, following fresh protests.A spokesman for Canterbury Cathedral said that the Most Rev Justin Welby’s comments “highlight the work already being taken by the Cathedral to identify items such as memorials, statues or heraldic images that may have links with colonialism or the slave trade, and to create clear contextual information that acknowledges the history of such objects in an honest and sensitive way”.“All of the Cathedral’s items are being reviewed to ensure that any connected with slavery, colonialism or contentious figures from other historic periods are displayed with clear objective interpretations and contextual information, and are presented in a way that avoids any sense of aggrandisement.“We hope that by providing this context – and acknowledging any associated oppression, exploitation, injustice and suffering connected with these objects – all visitors can leave with a greater understanding of our shared history and be inspired to undertake further learning and discussion.”A spokesman for Westminster Abbey said: “Its many memorials, which range in date from the thirteenth century to our own, also reflect the judgments and attitudes of the times in which those commemorations were made.”However: “In light of recent events, the Dean and Chapter of Westminster have begun a conversation about the Abbey’s memorials and how we can better reflect the attitudes of our time.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive government considers ending drivers mot holiday early","story":"The Government is considering ending drivers’ MOT holiday early amid fears more than a million unsafe cars could be flooding back onto the roads.The AA and RAC have led calls for ministers to axe the six-month extension on safety checks granted in March as part of lockdown restrictions.At the time, the Department for Transport granted an extension to anyone whose MOT was due from March 30 until the end of September, essentially making their certificate valid for 18 months. Under the current rules, drivers whose MOT runs out in September won’t have to get their vehicles tested until March 2021.However, driving associations have warned that the easing of lockdown on July 4 could see hundreds of thousands of unsafe cars back on the roads.Figures obtained by Motorway from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) show only 2.1 million MOTs were carried out in April and May, compared to 7.1 million in the same time period in 2019.DVSA figures show on average one third of vehicles fail their MOT on first inspection, meaning that around 1.6 million unsafe cars could now have valid MOTs.Sources told The  that ministers are considering whether to end the scheme early as lockdown unwinds.Edmund King, President of the AA, said he wanted to see the scheme brought to an end within two months as the current exemption “could lead to many more unsafe cars on the road”He said: “We believe the Government is right to reconsider the reintroduction of light vehicle MOTs.“We think they should amend the end date of these regulations, with the effect of reintroducing mandatory MOT testing from the amended end date.”Mr King’s call was backed by the RAC, which said polling showed only one in seven (14 per cent) of its members were intending to let their MOT run to the full six month extension period, with nearly half 44 per cent planning to get their vehicle checked as normal.The Government also faced calls to reverse the policy from garage owners, who said their businesses could easily be made covid-secure.Stuart James, chief executive of the Independent Garages Association said the extensions should end before cars started to flood back onto the roads with further lockdown easing planned on July 4.He said: “Now is the time to end the extension. People are being encouraged to use their cars to go shopping and go on days out to boost the economy, rather than use public transport. However, the MOT extension has been in place since March and we now have a situation where there are approximately 1.6 million unroadworthy cars in use on our roads.”Following the calls, a spokesman for the Department for Transport, said: “Vehicle owners have been granted a 6-month exemption from MOT testing, to enable vital services to continue, frontline workers to get to work, and to help people to get essential food and medicine during the COVID-19 outbreak.“It is still incumbent on vehicle-owners to ensure their vehicle is roadworthy and safe to use, even if they have been granted an exemption. Even with the 6 month extension to MOT checks, people can still take their vehicle in for an MOT test before then if they would prefer to“The duration of the changes to MOTs remain under review and we will work closely with the industry on future changes to the current exemption.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive half uks imported covid 19 infections pakistan","story":"Half of Britain’s imported coronavirus cases originate from Pakistan, The  understands, amid calls for tougher quarantine checks on arrivals from high risk countries.More than 65,000 people have travelled to Britain on 190 flights since March 1 from Pakistan, which is reporting 4,000 Covid-19 cases a day, and has seen a new spike in the disease after easing its lockdown measures. Most are thought to have UK passports.Data from Public Health England (PHE) shows that 30 cases of coronavirus in people who have travelled from Pakistan since June 4, which is understood to represent half of the incidents of imported infection.With up to two flights a day from Pakistan, there have been reports of some arrivals almost instantly going to hospital for intensive care, amid concerns that the influx has led to localised clusters.Officials are understood to be worried it could lead to a backlash against Britain, through it creating a backdoor for infections into Europe as the UK prepares to open air bridges.Officials are concerned that countries like Portugal may be importing cases from Brazil, but does not wish to say so explicitly because of our own colonial links.Bharat Pankhania, a quarantine expert at Exeter University’s medical school, said the Government needed to concentrate its resources on screening iniduals from high risk countries rather than a blanket light-touch quarantine where no-one is tested or physically supervised in the community.As soon as a country reaches a set threshold, then special screening and tests are done on all inidual arrivals at the border. If they are staying in Bath, for example, then the local public health director is alerted and they are subject to on-the-door checks by his or her team, he said.Concerns that passengers from Pakistan were spreading coronavirus saw one of the world\u0027s biggest long haul airlines suspend flights from the country this week.Dubai carrier Emirates suspended flights out of Pakistan after some 30 passengers on a June 22 flight to Hong Kong tested positive for Covid-19. Etihad and Fly Dubai also suspended flights out of Pakistan.This week, South Korea\u0027s government temporarily banned most people from Pakistan and Bangladesh from entering after it recorded increases in coronavirus cases from those countries.Ten players of Pakistan\u0027s cricket team supposed to take part in an upcoming series in England tested positive this week for Covid-19.British officials are understood to have repeatedly urged Pakistan to enact tougher controls on its flights as cases have grown.Pakistan International Airlines, the national carrier, said it had been flying direct to and from the UK since early April. At first irregular flights were organised according to demand to repatriate British and Pakistani nationals, with up to a dozen trips per week. In the past week the airline has resumed a more regular schedule flying daily to either London or Manchester.A spokesman said passengers were screened in Pakistan with heat sensors and had to wear masks. Anyone recording a high temperature during screening was not allowed on board.Officials estimate that at any one time there are some 100,000 British nationals in Pakistan, most of them dual nationals. Some 25,000 British nationals were repatriated from Pakistan between April 4 and May 13, almost all of them British Pakistanis.A Government spokesman said: The new health measures at the border are informed by science, backed by the public and designed to keep us all safe. We are seeing a high level of compliance and we expect this to continue as the vast majority of people will play their part to help stop the spread of this disease.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher suspended saying teachers sat home nothing lockdown","story":"When Pauline Wood, a primary school headteacher from Teeside, agreed to be interviewed by her local radio station, she did not intend to be anything other than truthful.But just two days after her interview, in which she said that some of her teachers were “sat at home doing nothing” during lockdown, she was shocked to learn she had been suspended.During her appearance on BBC Radio Newcastle earlier this month, Mrs Wood was asked if all teachers had been working hard while schools have been closed.She replied: “You can’t lump everyone together as if they are all one type…some teachers are coming up with the most imaginative, amazing things…and other people do sit at home doing nothing. I won’t defend those people.”When asked whether that included teachers at her own school, she said: “Yes, I think it’s time we talked about the elephant in the room in some of this.”Mrs Wood told the radio show that while “a lot can be done” by headteachers to motivate staff to work, it is a complex situation with “lots of HR rules, regulations, unions and people can say all reasons why they can and can’t work”.Two days after the interview she was suspended by the chair of governors who told her she had bought the school into disrepute.Mrs Wood told The Daily  that she stood by her comments, adding that headteachers around the country will agree with her but feel they have to “kowtow” to the unions and their local council in order to keep their jobs.“I have broad shoulders, I am not going to lie,” Mrs Wood said. “But the barriers for most heads are too great. There is a lot of pressure to toe the party line and there are lots of heads who think it’s not worth raising their head above the parapet.”She described how problems with staff began earlier this month, when she asked teachers to come for three days a week rather than two as more vulnerable children took up places at school. “We thought this was a perfectly reasonable request but a small minority of teachers didn’t like it,” she said.“They started getting in touch with their union who spoke to the council and they bent the ear of the chair of governors who agreed to it.” Mrs Wood said that teachers are “paid to work five days a week and should be acting as role models to children.“I have always promoted a hard work ethic, a no excuses and no quitting culture,” she said. “I always want to lead by example but this flies in the face of that.So I am not just going to say nothing”. Mrs Wood, who was due to stand down as head at the end of this academic year, said that her treatment has been a “bitter pill to swallow”. During her 15 years as head at Grange Park Primary, Mrs Wood transformed the school from being rated by Ofsted as “inadequate” to “outstanding”.The school, which is in a deprived community and has 40 per cent of pupils on free school meals, is one of the best performing in the country for maths and phonics.Over 100 headteachers from schools around the country have come to visit Grange Park primary in recent years to learn from its approach to boosting attainment among disadvantaged children, and Mrs Wood has been invited to give lectures about how to turn around underperforming schools.The school\u0027s most recent Ofsted report, from 2011, said that the “relentless” way Mrs Wood and her leadership team “pursue excellence and improvement has had an extremely positive impact on pupils’ results. Grange Park Primary School declined to comment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"maxine peake vs laurence fox reveals double standards chattering","story":"The trouble with double-standards in the age of mass communication is that everybody can see them. Where once an inidual, institution or movement might have hoped to conceal their hypocrisies, now they are there for everyone to witness. So it is with the case of Maxine Peake. This week, the actress made headlines because of an interview in which she alleged that the Israelis taught the US police how to kill George Floyd. The problem is that it is a lie. Even the far-Left, anti-Israel group Amnesty – widely alleged to be the source of the story – has denied that it is true. It is simple anti-Zionism reheated to suit the current moment.So perhaps it isn’t surprising that a Jeremy Corbyn protégée like Rebecca Long-Bailey should have retweeted the interview in which Peake made this claim. Apart from its racism, the interview included the standard actress stuff about the wonders of Corbynism and the importance of bringing down capitalism. They aren’t fools, these actresses. They know that if there’s one way that their profession will be reinvigorated, post-lockdown, it will be through the obliteration of the market economy. But Labour is now in new hands. And Keir Starmer swiftly sacked Long-Bailey. While his predecessor said there was no place for racism at the top of Labour, Starmer has done something to prove it.But the question I want answered is: where is Equity, the actors’ union? Earlier this year, after the actor Laurence Fox appeared on Question Time, the union (of which he is not even a member) denounced him. Fox’s crime was to say that he didn’t think Britain was a racist country. For this, Equity branded him a “disgrace”. Actor after actor lined up to condemn him and lobby to make sure he never worked again. After Fox took legal action and forced an apology out of Equity, the entire “race equality committee” of the union resigned.Perhaps this is why Equity have been so silent on Peake. Because there is no one left to do the full witch-dunking denunciation act. Or perhaps the silence is explained in another way. The same way that one might explain the silence of the actors and celebs who clambered over each other to denounce Fox. Could it be that most people in the acting and celebrity worlds are happy with someone who promotes conspiracy theories, so long as it is wrapped up in the fashionable idiot language of anti-capitalism and “equality”?I suspect so. In which case I would strongly recommend that Peake and her colleagues mull on something. What Fox said on Question Time reflects the sentiment of the vast majority of the British public. What Peake said reflects the views of a small group of malcontents who the public has rejected at the ballot box every time we have had the chance. So here is the thing, my actor-y friends. It’s not the public who are living in some hyper-partisan, out-of-touch bubble. It’s you.

It means that one of the most prized jobs in news broadcasting will now be “toothless”, according to one insider, with major decisions made by upper layers of management.In a change of strategy that will please No 10, the number of live interviews with politicians conducted by Today’s roster of presenters will be cut. Instead, the programme will often take a pooled interview, carried out by a BBC news correspondent such as Laura Kuenssberg and shared between a number of shows across radio and television.The changes are part of the corporation’s plans to centralise its newsgathering operation in an effort to save £80 million, by reducing the number of stories produced by the BBC and the number of journalists deployed.However, the result is that the autonomy of inidual shows will be reduced. Today staff fear it will weaken the programme, which was the subject of a No 10 boycott at the beginning of the year.“This used to be considered a plum job. But an executive editor will be essentially toothless,” a source said. One staff member said: “Using centralised interviews will weaken the Today programme, no question about it. Ministers won’t need a boycott - they’ll be able to say that there’s no need to appear on the programme because they’ve already done their one BBC interview of the day and that can be shared around.”Another insider said: “An editor should be free to choose the stories that go on the programme and decide how they are going to be covered. To reduce that role is ridiculous.”The second round of interviews begins next week. The BBC has struggled to attract candidates from outside the organisation.Internal applicants are said to include Owenna Griffiths, editor of Radio 4’s PM Richard Frediani, executive editor of BBC Breakfast Adam Cumiskey, chief programme producer on Newsnight and John Neal, editor of The Andrew Marr Show.Another female candidate pulled out of the process after it was made clear how little power the role now carries.The advertisement for the executive editor role stresses the need for “collaboration” with other BBC editors.It is understood that candidates have also been asked in interviews how they will manage redundancies, as part of the culling of 450 jobs in the news ision.The outgoing editor, Sarah Sands, handed in her notice in January, a day after the centralisation plans were unveiled by the BBC’s head of news, Fran Unsworth.Announcing the changes, Unsworth unveiled graphs and pie charts demonstrating the new “commissioning points” that will help to set the news agenda as part of “a modern newsroom that is built for the future and not the past”.Changes to the newsgathering operation are part of an £80 million cuts programme. Unsworth said the BBC’s priority was to aim news coverage at under-35s, and to plough more resources into online.The Today job spec says the successful applicant “will be tasked with maximising the impact of Today journalism, increasing the listening time of existing listeners and attracting new audiences”.It asks for “resilience, confidence, assured leadership with excellent communication skills, an enthusiasm for collaboration with other editors, and a commitment to managing and developing a first rate team.”The job offers “a flexible 35-hour working week for work-life balance”.The appointee will take up their role in September.

I didn’t want luxury prices, I wanted to be at the top end of the High Street. We found it very challenging to find any factories who could work with us within that price point.“And also a slight issue where, because we don’t have a very established, industrial fashion industry here, some of the factories that we looked at, if I’m being really honest, would not have passed our audit.“I think people would assume that if you audited a factory in the UK it would all be perfect because it’s the UK, and if you audited a factory in China then it might not be, but actually that’s not necessarily the case.“Because if you are working in a country where there is a lot of manufacturing of fashion, you’ll have really high quality factories, and we just don’t have a big enough industry here to have that spread.”Mrs Cameron stressed that she had not “found or looked at every factory there might be in the UK”.Mrs Cameron said she was striving for ersity in Cefinn’s workforce “and not just ethnic ersity - we have one man so I would quite like more men.”She has continued to work on her collections while in lockdown at the family’s home in Oxfordshire, and said that she had been “incredibly lucky” to have a husband who took charge of mealtimes.“I haven’t had to think about cooking or shopping for food.

Infected people pass virus cells in their faeces.Albert Bosch, a biology professor at Barcelona University and the coordinator of the study, said that timing could have made all the difference in Spain\u0027s handling of Covid-19, which has killed more than 28,000 people in the country.“In the specific case of Barcelona, having detected the contagion of SARS-CoV-2 a month earlier could have improved the response to the pandemic,” he said. To obtain their results, the team analysed frozen samples of waste water from two previous years, providing the shock result of a low positive from 12 March 2019.    No examples of Covid-19 infection had been recorded at this time, but Professor Bosch said it was possible that similar results could be found globally. “Since most Covid-19 cases show a similar symptomatology to the flu, those cases could have been disguised as an undiagnosed flu,” he said.   However, scientists were sceptical about the findings announced by the Barcelona University team. Dr Jonathan Stoye, head of the Retrovirus-Host Interactions Laboratory at The Francis Crick Institute, told The  that more analysis was needed before the claim could be confirmed, noting that not all of the testing results had been aligned in the March 2019 sample.“It may be right, but when you’re making a claim as important as this one, there cannot be any ambiguities or red flags, which is why I am sceptical,” he said. Professor Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Insitute, said it seemed most unlikely.The most plausible explanation is sample mix-upcontamination. Obviously, the presence of SARS-CoV-2, or a closely related virus, in circulation that early would have to be considered if other water samples from around that time tested positive, he added.  Professor Balloux said that his team\u0027s genetic analyses confidently rule out that the SARS CoV-2 lineage causing Covid-19 was in circulation in spring 2019.  He added: If the presence of SARS CoV-2-linke RNA were to be confirmed prior to late 2019, which I doubt, it would be a separate outbreak by another coronavirus lineage. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lost item posed no risk to either the spacewalk or the station, NASA said.Spacewalking astronauts wear a wrist mirror on each sleeve to get better views while working. The mirror is just 5 inches by 3 inches, and together with its band has a mass of barely one-tenth of a pound.Nasa renaming headquarters in honour of first black female engineerCassidy and Bob Behnken, who followed him out without mishap, were conducting the first of at least four spacewalks to replace the last bunch of old station batteries.Once the six new lithium-ion batteries are installed, the orbiting lab should be good for the rest of its operational life, according to NASA. The big, boxy batteries — more powerful and efficient than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries coming out — keep the station humming when it\u0027s on the night side of Earth.The battery replacements began in 2017, with previous crews putting in 18 lithium-ion batteries, half as many as the old ones replaced.Cassidy and Behnken have six more to plug in before the job is complete. It\u0027s cumbersome work: Each battery is about a yard (meter) tall and wide, with a mass of 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Their spacewalks are expected to continue through July before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo? You’ll find plenty of of delicious ideas from the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Amanda Grant at vegpower.org.uk. You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline. Former Love Island contestant Joshua Ritchie, who was allegedly among those who turned up at the beach, was seen carrying a large speaker with friends in a video.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman declined to comment on particular scenes on beaches, but told reporters: “The prime minister and the government’s scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.“It is only due to the public’s hard work that we have been able to bring the virus under control, and if the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will have to look at having to reverse some of the easements that have been put in place and I don’t think anyone in the British public would want that to happen.”There were hundreds of kids grouped up on the Roath Park Rec earlier this evening. They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are among the stars who have today urged Londoners to bid on sections of Sir Peter Blake’s pop artwork Our Fans to raise money for Help the Hungry.Last Friday, The Independent announced that the giant mural — draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge during its 2017 renovation — would be cut into 100 sections and auctioned off.The work, which echoes Sir Peter’s famous 1967 artwork for The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, is his largest piece, the size of 38 London buses. Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry. I can’t be more honoured.”The piece was originally commissioned by London Advertising, whose founder Michael Moszynski said: “We’re looking forward to seeing the final figures raised.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

But\u0026nbspthe unprecedented circumstances could not dampen spirits, Colin Drury findsThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Not long after Liverpool had won their last league title back in 1990, Harvey Morrison’s older brother mentioned to the then 12-year-old how the club’s northwest rivals Manchester United had not been champions for more than 20 years.“I said to him, ‘Twenty years? That’s ancient history’,” he recalls today. “I went, ‘That could never happen to us’.”The Anfield season ticket-holder thought about this conversation while sat alone on his doorstep at 1am on Friday morning.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree hours earlier, the Reds – once the dominant force in English football – had been crowned champions for the first time since that 1990 success after title rivals Man City lost to Chelsea.In the celebrations that followed, almost everyone on Morrison’s Bootle street flooded into their gardens to sing and cheer. Most put up flags and bunting. Harvey’s son, seven-year-old Tom, brought out a life-sized cutout of Mo Salah and stuck it in the front lawn. Someone a couple of roads along was letting off fireworks.Liverpool fans celebrate winning first title in 30 years“But when it was all done and we’d got the kids in bed, I just needed a moment to myself,” says the father-of-two.He sat out in the warm night with his last beer of the evening. “I was trying to savour it, mate,” he says. “Thirty years I’ve been waiting for this. It was overwhelming.”Did he cry? “No comment. Let’s just say I was emotional.”Such stories – of cheers, beers and tears – come thick and fast in Liverpool on Friday, the day after the glorious night before.This may be a country still officially in coronavirus lockdown – the pubs were shut and Anfield remained locked up – but such restrictions could not dampen spirits here. An estimated 2,000 fans had turned up at the stadium to toast the title on Thursday night, while hundreds more had descended on the squares and parks of the city centre. Those who stayed at home – as authorities had encouraged people to do – turned suburban streets into late-night carnivals.“Come head, mate,” one lad, Mike Pinnington, a 21-year-old railway worker, had told The Independent in the city’s Concert Square. “It would have had to be the plague to stop us having a bevvy a night like this.”By the next day, it was clear this was a widely held view: after three decades – as well as a wait of 14 weeks while the season was suspended due to the Covid-19 crisis – the release was palpable. On Friday, Liverpool was a city of sore heads and shadows lifted.“When I was leaving the house this morning, I saw a neighbour just getting home,” said Morrison, a council transport officer, as we spoke in the city’s Liverpool One complex. “That was 9am. I’m not sure where he’d been all night. He wasn’t in the best state to talk.”The unbridled joy was perhaps because this felt bigger than mere sport.Liverpool is a place whose identity is entwined with its club. For it not to have topped the English league for 30 years seemed, to some, like an unfair reflection on their home town. In a city which has long struggled with huge levels of deprivation – one in three children live in poverty in Merseyside according to a 2019 report – the fall from grace of their football club had felt, to many, like insult added to injury.It\u0027s massive, said Scott Craven, a 21-year-old joiner. It puts a spring in the city\u0027s step. You look round and people are happy.Even Evertonians? They might as well be happy about it because they\u0027re never going to win the league themselvesWhen Liverpool last claimed the title, the Premiership did not yet exist, a nascent Sky Sports was going by the name The Sports Channel, and only five members of the current squad had been born. Back then, they were the most successful club in English football history and had finished in the top two every year, bar one, since 1973.Safe to say, no one here saw a sudden 30-year hiatus happening. Certainly, no one saw their record haul of 18 titles being overturned by then struggling Man United, who now have 20 to their name.“We’ll have that many soon, though,” says Mo Abdul, a 25-year-old research and development scientist who spent the night in Chavasse Park and then with hundreds of fans gathered outside St Luke’s bombed-out church. “This is the start of an era,” he added.That may be but, it may be worth saying, some fear it may also be the start of a second coronavirus spike. Concerns have already been raised that the spontaneous gatherings – where social distancing was decidedly not observed – could ultimately end up going down in history as a series of super-spreader events. Certainly, city authorities and club manager Jurgen Klopp have now urged fans (again) to hold off holding further celebrations.“I agree with that,” said Abdul. “Perhaps there should have been more social distancing last night. But I think people got caught up in the moment. We’re a city obsessed with football. No one’s saying there should be a bus parade until it’s safe but this was just a release, I think.”It was a view shared by Carl McDonald, a Liverpool fan and A\u0026ampE care assistant who had been working the night shift at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.“We had a couple of people come in who’d been hurt falling off things they’d been climbing,” the 38-year-old said with a shrug “It happens”.As a supporter and NHS worker, how did he feel about the mass celebrations? “I’d preferred them not to have happened,” he replied. “I’ve seen what coronavirus does to you. But people have been waiting to win the Premiership for so long – I think it would have been hard to stop it.”He himself was able to keep up with the night’s unfolding events because patients across his wards were listening to the Man City match. “I had to stop myself shouting out when Chelsea scored,” he noted.Katrina and Abigail Baybutt had no such concerns.The mother and daughter – who have travelled across Europe supporting the club – watched the all-important Man City match at home. “We were pretty loud, pretty hyper,” said Katrina, a 42-year-old accounts officer and mother-of-three. “Jumping around the living room, texting friends, singing.”The kids, she means? “Mainly the kids, but perhaps me a little bit too.”Yet she admitted – in common with most fans here – that there was a tinge of sadness that this was not a normal season that the club will ultimately end up being presented with the trophy at a game which fans cannot attend. “It’s a real shame,” she said.“But it’s okay,” perked up Abigail, 14, as the pair started to make their way in to the Liverpool store. “It means we’ll just have to win it again next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.The task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Bel Trew reports in the third part of our seriesThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The rumours quickly spread among the Syrian fighters in Libya. A group of mercenaries recently hired by the internationally recognised Libyan government were in hospital with serious chest infections. Panic rippled through the ranks that it was the deadly coronavirus. No measures had been taken when they started their long trip from northern Syria via Turkey to Tripoli. No one had self-isolated, worn a mask or had a test.“We tried to find out more information but couldn’t,” said one fighter, among an estimated 6,000 Syrians employed to support Libya’s Government of National Accord (GNA), which is backed by Turkey. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe said his commanders were tightlipped about the incident. The GNA denied the rumours in a statement to The Independent. Instead its officials have blamed their foes – the forces of renegade general Khalifa Haftar – of spreading Covid-19 through their own foreign mercenaries. “There are no precautions taken here for fighters, it’s like coronavirus doesn’t exist,” the fighter lamented.  Wars have ravaged healthcare systems across the Middle East and North Africa, leaving several countries extremely susceptible to outbreaks of Covid-19. But world health officials are now concerned about a new secret spreader of the disease: combatants. Over the past few months, as the pandemic swept across the globe, swathes of soldiers, fighters and mercenaries from countries such as Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq have been deployed to frontlines across the region, despite the fact that their cross-border journeys break international lockdowns and travel restrictions.Little to no care has been taken to mitigate this potentially devastating transmission of the disease even though many of these countries are among the most vulnerable to the pandemic. The secretive nature of their movement makes contact tracing impossible.  Officials from the World Health Organisation and other United Nations bodies have all sounded the alarm, telling The Independent that with such little information and testing, there is no way to accurately measure what damage might have been done. They say local efforts to stamp out the disease will be undermined by the continued international movement of troops, prolonging and deepening existing outbreaks or even creating new clusters. “Clearly you want to control public health measures at border crossings, airports and ports,” said Richard Brennan, acting regional emergency director for WHO’s eastern Mediterranean regional office. “Ideally, you would be screening people and enforcing quarantines.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now there are armed groups coming in, without screening, no quarantining and no tracking in the country. This is exactly the kind of the way the disease can spread unchecked.” He said it was a problem across the region, made worse by the fact that combatants then moved around the countries they had travelled to.  Libya, meanwhile, has morphed into the world’s newest proxy war with a huge influx of combatants into the country despite coronavirus lockdowns. UN investigators, those across Libya and Syria as well as the fighters themselves, estimate that well over 10,000 Syrians fighters have travelled to fight on both sides of Libya’s conflict since January. That deployment accelerated through the spring just as Covid-19 gripped the world. Thousands of Syrians from opposition areas sent to fight for the GNA have travelled through Turkey, a country with one of the worst outbreaks in the region. Turkey has had more than 190,000 Covid-19 cases and 5,000 deaths. A new brigade of Syrian fighters reportedly arrived just last week, according to sources in Syria and Libya.  UN investigators, meanwhile, say at least 2,000 Syrians from pro-regime areas have been hired via Russian companies to fight for General Haftar in the east of the country. The Independent was able to track a surge in recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to General Haftar’s ranks as late as mid-May in the middle of the pandemic. Forces allegedly continue to be recruited this week. On Wednesday, Libya’s National Centre for Disease Control announced its biggest daily increase yet in coronavirus infections and deaths. Nearly 700 cases have now been counted, and 18 deaths.But without proper contact tracing and tests, it is impossible to confirm the true rate of the outbreak in Libya or whether there is a link between the flood of foreign troops and the spike in cases. There is already little capacity to do that in many places like Libya. Now there are armed groups coming in, without screening, no quarantining and no tracking in the country, this is exactly the kind of the way the disease can spread uncheckedHowever, UN officials have warned the cross-border movement of combatants poses a substantial risk for the country where hospitals have been bombed, and there are shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators and Covid-19 tests. “Our view is that Libya has not reached the peak of the threat of the coronavirus,” Stephanie Williams, deputy chief of the UN’s support mission in Libya (Unsmil) told The Independent. “There’s not enough testing. There is minimal containment. Yet there are continuing flights into Libya.” Health officials have expressed similar concerns about foreign troops travelling to fight in other parts of the region, including in Syria’s own deeply complex civil war.Turkey has deployed troops to opposition-held areas of Syria since 2016 to back rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by Iran, Russia and Iranian-backed paramilitary groups from Lebanon and Iraq. Thousands of Turkish troops, police, municipal officials, and employees of the government and charities cross in and out of Syria every day. Rahmi Dogan, the governor of the southern province of Hatay, admitted at the start of the month that 140 soldiers and police officers working in the opposition-held Syrian cities of Afrin and Idlib, had contracted the coronavirus. Libya’s general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenariesThe news, reported in both Turkish and Syrian media, has sparked panic among Syrian residents and fighters in the Idlib and western Aleppo area, where there is a woeful lack of personal protective equipment, ventilators and just one testing machine for the four million people who live there. Many civilians are displaced from other parts of Syria and so live in overcrowded, unhygienic camps, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the disease. The Turkish authorities have maintained that they immediately isolated and evacuated those in northern Syria who contracted the coronavirus. They promised to minimise troop movement in the operation zone.But within the war-ravaged area, Syrian residents say vulnerable families have no access to healthcare and so are keeping their distance from Turkish soldiers.“We are afraid of transmission of Covid-19, the virus can only have come to the north of Syria when the Turkish units switch shifts,” said Mohamed Abdullah, one Syrian rebel. “There were cases detected in Afrin and Mastuma camp.”Meanwhile, in regime-held areas of Deir Ezzor to the east, there have been multiple unconfirmed reports about outbreaks of Covid-19 among forces that hail from Iran and Iraq, two countries that are struggling to stamp out huge outbreaks. Daniel al-Furati, who is from Deir Ezzor, said over the last few months crossings with Iraq “remain entirely open” for Iranian and Iraqi militiamen who are fighting on the side of the Syrian regime.“Those groups came into contact with the local pro-government brigades,” he said. “They are infected and transmit the coronavirus to the population there.”Deir Ezzor 24, a local activist collective, also reported this phenomenon. They accused Assad’s forces of enforcing a “media blackout” on the origins of Covid-19 infections there.Without testing it is again impossible to confirm. The Syrian regime has denied outbreaks in the eastern border area.Far from addressing public health concerns of combatants flowing in and out of warzones during the pandemic, belligerents are trading accusations over the spreading of the coronavirus.  Libyan health officials in Tripoli have repeatedly accused Haftar’s Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF) of spreading the virus through its mercenaries, which according to the United States Africa Command and UN investigators include 2,000 Russians, 2,000 Syrians and 2,000 Sudanese. GNA health ministry spokesperson Ameen al-Hashimi told The Independent that the authorities had been anxiously following dozens of flights allegedly carrying Syrian and possibly Russian mercenaries from Syria to east Libya this year.“When we contacted the health authorities in the east they said that their troops were not subject to any health analyses or quarantines and were sent directly to the frontlines in west Libya, which poses a danger to citizens,” Mr Hashimi said.He said sources in the east had also told them several foreign nationals including Russians and Syrians had been isolated over the last few months with Covid-19 symptoms. The LAAF, which vehemently denies having foreign fighters among its ranks, threw similar accusations at the GNA, saying it was “ironic” that the Tripoli government was complaining about the coronavirus.“We are worried about the virus among the Syrian mercenaries the GNA has deployed,” one LAAF spokesman told The Independent. He said that they had received reports of at least 17 Syrian mercenaries being hospitalised with the virus two months ago, echoing rumours The Independent had also been told.  The tidal surge of forces has not abated. Sources in northern Syria told The Independent that hundreds of Syrian fighters had crossed into Turkey ready to be sent to Tripoli for the GNA in the coming days – despite a recent surge in coronavirus in Turkey over the last few weeks. Syrian fighters already in Libya said there was regular back and forth between the two countries as brigades were sent home and fresh recruits were brought over in a kind of “changing of the guard”. This was also reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which claimed as many as 1,800 have arrived in Turkey to undergo military training ready to fly to Libya while 2,600 have returned to Syria from Libya this month alone. “No one cares about coronavirus here,” said one Syrian mercenary in west Libya. “We had no lockdown, no measures in place, no masks, no testing, no hand sanitisers. It’s like it didn’t happen.”While anyone can spread coronavirus, Covid-19 symptoms tend to most badly afflict the elderly and the infirm, while mostly sparing the young athletic men in their 20s and 30s who make up the bulk of warriors in combat zones.  Another asked about coronavirus measures was sanguine. “It isn’t something we are thinking about,” he said. “We are more worried about being shot.” Read the first part of the Soldiers of Misfortune series here: Libya’s beleaguered general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenaries and businessmen, and the second part here: Inside the murky world of Libya’s mercenariessoldiers of misfortune\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Moreover, it was returning with two invaluable pieces of cargo. On the flight to Ulaanbaatar were 255 Mongolian citizens, stranded in the US since the pandemic struck. Along with them were several boxes of dinosaur fossils, more than 65 million years old, illicitly obtained and now being returned to their rightful home. The fossils, of creatures such as Tarbosaurus bataar, a relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, had been originally found in the vast Gobi desert, known by palaeontologists around the world. It was there in the 1920s and 1930s that American explorer Roy Chapman Andrews found the first fossilised dinosaur egg, and with it proof that dinosaurs were reptiles. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYet, while the whip-carrying Andrews, said to be the true-life inspiration for Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones and who died in 1960, obtained permission for his expeditions from the Mongolian government, many who followed – either in person, or through intermediaries – did not. The fossils packed into the hold of the Mongolian Airlines plane, among them two fossilised skulls of Tarbosaurus bataar, represented the latest success in a decade-long effort to locate and repatriate artefacts she passionately believes belong in her native Mongolia.“I really want dinosaur fossils that are from Mongolia to be displayed in Mongolia, and for the public to learn about their cultural heritage.”She adds “They have a lack of knowledge and they’re not appreciating this heritage as much as they should have been. Because of that, we are facing this problem of people selling fossils for money.”Bolortsetseg’s work has seen her travel the United States, working with both the government of Mongolia and officials from the the US Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for the investigation of stolen items. On several occasions, she has acted as an expert witness in court cases, where lawyers for the Mongolian government sought to prove items were genuine. She has done so as dinosaur fossils, perhaps as a result of films such as Jurassic Park, which Spielberg also directed, have become increasingly sought after, often as status symbols. In 2015, actor Nicolas Cage voluntarily handed over a Tarbosaurus bataar skull he had bought in auction in 2007, and for which he had paid $276,000, outbidding Leonardo DiCaprio among others. Cage did so after prosecutors in New York filed a civil forfeiture claim, saying the item had been obtained illegally.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPart of the challenge for people such as Bolortsetseg is that since 1990, when Mongolia established a democracy after six-decades of Soviet-controlled rule, her nation has become increasingly open to the outside world. While Mongolia has had laws dating back to 1924 that make fossil collection or removal illegal, collectors and enthusiasts have taken advantage of the increased ease of access to the world’s most sparsely populated nation and its cultural treasures.Two areas in particular, the Flaming Cliffs, and the Nemegt Basin, both in the southern Ömnögovi Province, have attracted huge interest.Bolortsegtseg Minjin on the repatriation of Mongolian dinosaurs“When you open up, it’s not just well-wishers who arrive, but also those looking to make quick money,” says Yondon Otgonbayar, Mongolia’s US ambassador, who travelled to Seattle to oversee both the arrival of the PPE equipment, and the return of the fossils. “Now we’re are working to recover those stolen items.”Bolortsetseg estimates in the past decade she has helped repatriate more than 50 inidual dinosaur fossils or collections, that were flown back in four shipments, Sunday’s being the most recent. Several legal actions to recover other fossils are ongoing.Other than of the skull bought by Nicolas Cage, the most high-profile involved an entire Tyrannosaurus bataar skeleton, obtained among a number of dinosaur fossils by a Florida collector, Eric Prokopi, and put up for sale in New York city for $1m in 2012.Prokopi would eventually plead guilty, as part of a deal with federal prosecutors, to illegally smuggling dinosaur fossils and give up several other skeletons in his possession. The skull bought by Cage had in fact been originally been obtained by a gallery in Beverly Hills, IM Chait. The gallery had bought a number of items from Prokopi, who initially argued he had committed no crime because the fossils had been brought to the US from the UK, rather than directly from Mongolia. He was jailed for three months.“Each of these fossils represents a culturally and scientifically important artifact looted from its rightful owner,” said then Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara. He called Prokopi a “one-man black market in prehistoric fossils”.The pieces returned this week followed investigations by ICE agents in several locations across the country. Bolortsetseg said three separate legal actions were involved.“In 2012, officers in New York, Wyoming and Salt Lake City initiated cultural property investigations related to the sale of dinosaur fossils that originated in Mongolia,” says ICE spokesperson Kate Pote. “Mongolian patrimony laws prohibit the export and private ownership of any prehistoric dinosaur fossil or specimen.”Pope says a fourth case, again involving Prokopi, was in the process of being resolved and ICE planned to “release this fossil to Mongolia in the coming months”. It is unclear whether Prokopi, the subject of a book, The Dinosaur Artist: Obsession, Betrayal, and the Quest for Earth’s Ultimate Trophy, by Paige Williams, was directly inspired by Roy Chapman Andrews, who launched three separate expeditions to Mongolia, in the capacity as an explorer for New York’s American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), where he started his career in 1906 mopping the floors. He would later graduate to the taxidermy department before travelling through Mongolia on US-made cars he imported for the purpose. “I wanted to go everywhere. I would have started on a day’s notice for the North Pole or the South, to the jungle or the desert,” he wrote in Under a Lucky Star, one of a dozen books. To some, such as the Roy Chapman Andrews Society, established in the explorer’s birthplace of Beloit, Wisconsin, Andrews was a pioneering hero, who auctioned off some of the eggs he brought back to the US in order to fund subsequent expeditions. In 1935, he became director of the prestigious AMNH, where a number of his Mongolian dinosaur finds are still on display.Others, including Bolortsetseg, say his actions took place in a less informed era. “Hero is not the word,” she says. His intention may have been good, she adds, but “this whole thing happened around the time of a colonial mindset”.(Neither the society or the AMNH responded to enquiries.)Indeed, the repatriation of items to Mongolia comes amid a broader cultural reckoning, with many nations, and their museums, being pressured to return items collected, or looted, depending on one\u0027s perspective, during colonial times. Last year, the authors of an influential report accused the British Museum of acting like an “an ostrich with its head in the sand” over the issue.In Mongolia, over the last decade there has been an urgency to use the publicity created by the return of the dinosaur fossils to educate people about their heritage. A museum was specially constructed to house the fossils.Among those who supported this was Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a writer and activist and onetime minister of culture, sport and tourism.Speaking from Ulaanbaatar, Oyungerel tells The Independent that one of the challenges in educating Mongolians was the historic views of bones as something unclean. Oyungerel, who grew up in a nomadic herding community, says children are taught to keep away from the bones of dead animals, as they may be harbouring disease.Steadily, she says, people are learning that unlike the bones they may encounter on the steppes, the dinosaur remains are fossilised items, like stone.Bolortsetseg says few things give her more pleasure that travelling around Mongolia in a mobile museum to show the fossils to children and their parents, and to tell them where they come from.She has so far visited 10 of its 22 provinces.“The kids are really excited. Some of them say they’ve seen dinosaur movies, but they think dinosaurs are from America,” she says.“And I said, no, the movie’s made in America, but the dinosaur was actually found in your back yard.”She adds: “I say ‘You know the Velociraptor’. Velociraptor is from Jurassic Park, and I play them the video. And I say ‘This dinosaur is from your back yard’.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more. Rough And Rowdy Ways is a joy to listen to – and I’d given up on the bloke in the s.If I ever reach  I intend to make a grime album with Rihanna. Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative. But there aren’t enough people called Olly and Poppy in the country, which is why Labour hasn’t won an election for  years. Unless it reconnects with the people it was set up to support, the working class, it won’t win one for another few decades either.A SOCIAL media site had a big hit when it asked people to reveal things they regretted about getting married. The site, Whisper, was inundated with replies. Most were kind of: “I just wish I hadn’t married the fat bastard, full stop.”But some wished they’d had a fling with someone of the same sex first, or felt aggrieved they hadn’t checked out the in-laws first. That was quite a big issue.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that’s with the two-metre rule.Yes, it’s easier with a small school. But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left. Although the Government could have done better in prioritising education, the wrecking crew have revelled in  confronting and defying the Tories, blocking efforts to reopen fully.Even now, the PM’s announcement that schools must open in September is branded “pure fantasy” by one union.We do not yet know the true cost to our children’s education, le chances and health from this failure of will. The unions have betrayed our kids and tarnished the image of the teachers they represent and who would love to get back to the classroom.PUBS with no music, singing, dancing or shouting  That’s just a library with more beer and no books.And how about visor-clad hairdressers snipping in enforced silence, with no gossip or radio It all sounds like a sci-fi dystopia of Britain. But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning. The scientists say all these activities pass on Covid in the breath. And they are desperate to avoid a new surge in cases.Some might see little point in a pub with the le sucked out of it. But we must use them or lose them.From July , support your local.

I mean, I’ve only been able to see Dear Evan Hansen  times so far.And Christmas won’t be the same without the uniquely British tradition of the winter panto. How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Dame Judi Denchs warning that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention this week – and it worked.Launching an impassioned plea to Oliver Dowden to “safely open” ballroom dance studios on my talkRADIO Drivetime show, the Strictly Come Dancing judge teased: “If Oliver is out there, I don’t even mind having a cha-cha-cha with him to show him it is possible to social distance.”Clearly the power of the Queen of Latin remains undiminished.Within hours, Oliver had tweeted: “Shirley, as a Strictly fan, I’m happy to talk about how we can get dancing going safely again. Great offer on the cha-cha-cha – I’ll get practising.”Expect dance studios to be back in business imminently, then.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Greek tourism minister Haris Theoharis said the country wanted British tourists towhen it opens to other European holidaymakers on July .He said: The final decision, from the UK and our point of view, will be in place in the next few days and Im hoping the announcement will be positive from both sides.

Being from the UK, it’s one of those gigs I think everyone wants to do. Hopefully next year.“But no f***ing way am I camping. No way. I’d have to build a house for it to work.“I’ve been to so many festivals with my mates but I’ve not done any camping stuff.“I’ve got the worst OCD so I wouldn’t be camping at all. That’s probably why I don’t have crazy stories from festivals.”Essex-born Jonas, whose real name is Guy James Robin, has cemented himself as one of the biggest names in dance music in the past five years, selling more than million records.Today he’s back with summer anthem Naked, featuring US singer MAX, but it won’t be part of a bigger collection after he decided releasing full albums is no longer for him.Jonas said: “I’m not going to be doing an album any time soon. I really enjoy doing singles. I can move quickly with them, especially in the world that I’m in, because the trends are forever changing.“I’m not planning to saturate the market with loads of records, it’s just about putting Naked out and that being my biggest record to date, I hope.”Jonas hopes the song will be “uplting” for people as we come out of lockdown. But as someone who knows nightclubs better than anyone , he insisted there is no chance they can reopen anytime soon.He explained: “Clubs will not work, how can you tell , drunk people to stand a metre or two metres apart  It’s never going to f***ing work.“It wouldn’t work with meI’d had a few drinks. I wouldn’t even know what two metres is at that point.”SHE is usually a Glasto regular and it’s a good bet you will find her partying into the early hours, but Rita Ora will have to make do with her back garden this weekend.The How To Be Lonely singer shared this photo on Instagram while sunbathing at home in her bra in the scorching temperatures.But she didn’t put as much thought into what she’d be wearing as she would have doneshe was heading to Somerset.She captioned the snap: “Can’t find my bikini.”It must have been a welcome relief for her to get outside though, having spent lockdown working hard on new music.She posted another photo of her home studio, where it was C, and wrote: “Hope you are all having fun outside enjoying the sun, meanwhile we’re cutting vocals with no air con.”Just think about all the tunes you’ll have to perform by the time you hit Worthy Farm next year, Rita.The superstar had said her album would be coming in September but her manager has now confirmed it is being pushed back, partly because the coronavirus crisis prevented her from finishing it.Jonathan Dickins said: “It isn’t coming in September. It’ll be ready when it’s ready.“We’re all in the same boat. You’re doing stuff and then suddenly the world stops.“It’ll come when it’s ready. We have music but we’re still working.”It’s been five years since her third album  was released, while January will mark a decade since her breakthrough record  which sold million copies to become one of the biggest records of all time.If Adele has taught us anything with her music, it’s that it will certainly be worth the wait.LITTLE MIX’s Jesy Nelson probably wouldn’t get very far across Worthy Farm in these shoes.She showed off slippers made to look like her pet pooches on Instagram, amid hopes the girl group could be signed up for next year’s festival.They are expected to have released their sixth album by then and could be a perfect signing for a team eager for more female artists.Jesy said in : “We would love to do Glastonbury, it would be incredible for us to do that. I think we’d be able to get a new audience that maybe we don’t have, people who aren’t too sure about Little Mix. We could prove them wrong, change their mind.”The singer, whose song Blue Jumper is out today, was picked up while supporting the band on tour but almost didn’t get to play for a music boss in the crowd.She said: “I’d gone over a little bit on my set. I was about to do my one hit and the stage director said, ‘You need to finish now’.“The head of Universal had just arrived. Richard ran over and was like, ‘No, let her play another’.”FOO FIGHTERS’ incredible  headline set is among a load of performances stream-ing through iPlayer over the weekend. You can also see Beyonce, David Bowie, Blur, George Ezra, Arctic Monkeys and more.THIS year’s festival was due to be the biggest yet but organiser Emily Eavis has insisted ticket holders are in for a bumper event when it s next year.She said they are hoping to roll over much of this year’s line-up, but had already booked loads of acts for , which may even mean making the festival longer.Emily said: “We’re rolling two festivals together for . We’ve got a hell of a lot of surprises and things that we were planning for the thand we’re going to try to get those things going for next year.“Logistically it’s a little bit complicated because we’d already pencilled in many of the acts for . It was one of those very unusual years where you’re quite far ahead, two years ahead, on the line-up. So we’re trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.“We’ve had lots of amazing letters from people with ideas of how we could make it into like a two-week holiday or run over three weekends. There’s lots of ideas going.”Taylor Swt Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney were due to headline this weekend and Emily is hoping they will all be back, especially Beatles legend Paul.She said on BBC  Music: “I really hope he’ll be back next year singing it from the Pyramid and we’ll all be in tears, going, ‘It’s happened, we’re back’.”Me too.SIMON BOYLE - COLDPLAY : THEIR fourth time as headline act and they proved to be one of the greatest ever. CHRIS MARTIN and co won over even the most sceptical festivalgoer and had people in tears with their performance, complete with confetti, light-up bracelets and fireworks.JOE KASPER - DAVE : IT wasn’t just his fantastic performance but meeting his fan Alex Mann, who he got up from the crowd to rap his song Thiago Silva. It was enough to convert workmates I had dragged along to become fans of the Mercury Prize winner and, dare I say, grime.HOWELL DAVIES - LORDE : AT only , she proved to be a cut above when she delivered a standout set, partly from within a huge glass box suspended on stage. The Kiwi’s rousing tracks were lapped up and her visuals included dancers, lasers and clouds of smoke.ELLIE HENMAN - LEWIS CAPALDI : THE moment he swaggered on dressed as Noel Gallagher, I knew this set would be my highlight. At the end he told the massive crowd: “If you haven’t enjoyed it keep it to your f***ing self.” Safe to say, everyone loved it.KESHA has released a tribute to Marc Bolan of T.Rex, who headlined the first Glasto in .

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Doctor Qin Xiaowen, a surgeon at the hospital, said: There was a solid object in her nasal cavity. A CT confirmed it to be a tooth measuring  centimetres .“Family members said the child tripped and fell when she was two. She lost one of her teeth, but they never found it and thought it had fallen out somewhere.The stunned doctor added that the impact of the fall had pushed the tooth into her nasal cavity, with only the root of her tooth visible in her nostril and the rest under her skin.The young girl underwent surgery to have the tooth fully removed on nd June, and is now expected to make a full recovery.Wang Yanhui, head of the hospital’s ear, nose and throat department, called the case “exceedingly rare”.A British dentist added that, while such cases are possible, teeth do not grow when lodged in a nasal cavity.They said: It is possible for a tooth to go into the nasal space or maxillary sinusthe trauma is severe. But it wont continue to grow.If it was continuing to grow, then it was most probably the adult tooth. When you sustain an injury to a milktooth, it can have an effect on the development of the adult tooth.The effect is dependent on the age of the trauma.Shown the images he said: It looks like something called dilaceration. Essentially, the direction of the trauma has caused a change in the direction of the development of the adult tooth, so its developed out of the nasal cavity.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: Its crucial people understand that on  July we get this right and we do this in a balanced way and we recognise the risks.You may think youre not going to get it and youre immortal and invincible and so on. And very likely thats true, particularlyyoure a young person.But the bug you carry can kill elderly people particularly. Its still dangerous. The virus is still out there.Downing Street has suggested the decision to close beaches would be left up to local authorities, after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said they would be closedpeople continued to flout the rules. But the Chairman of the Local Government Associations Community Wellbeing Board said they did not have the resources to deal with the massive crowds. Councillor Ian Hudspeth said: “It is hugely dficult for a council to keep beaches open to the public while also limiting the number of people who visit. Closing beaches in one area may also simply sht the problem where.“Councils and the emergency services cannot be left to manage this issue alone. The Government can help councils by stepping up efforts to educate the public on the specic risks posed by ignoring social distancing in tourist environments.He added that lives depended on people taking personal responsibility for their actions. The Governments Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has also warned that cases will risepeople dont enjoy the sun sensibly. Professor Whitty wrote on Twitter last night: COVID- circulation has gone down due to the efforts of everyone but is still in general circulation. If we do not follow social distancing guidance then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all. Bournemouth MP Tobias Ellwood said beaches should be closedpeople dont behave sensibly.He told the BBC: Yesterdaywas deluged and social distancing went out the window. A major incident was declared, the local authority and indeed the police couldnt cope. The beach should have been closed down or at least shut down to prevent people from entering. Mr Ellwood warned that he would hate to see Bournemouth or any seaside resort be where the second spike is the first to appear. The local authorities needed to be handed out greater powers and resources to shut down and close beachesthey are swamped with people, the MP said.Mr Ellwood added: We need to make sure no beach was like yesterday, those scenes were unacceptable, until there is a vaccine we should not be seeing this. He said it was a perfect storm where people were still furloughed and children were out of classrooms and everyone decided to pile into the beach. When asked about the over-crowding on beaches, a spokesman for Downing Street said: Everyone should be able to enjoy the sunshine, and we understand that people want to enjoy public spaces.But it is important we dont undo the hard work of the British public in reducing the transmission of this virus.It is a matter for local authorities to manage numbers, alongside emergency services and Public Health England.As we saw yesterday they are best placed to make those decisions on a case-by-case basis.We have been clear that should we see case numbers increase we will introduce local lockdowns.Pressed on whether the Government would close beaches, the Number  spokesman said: It is for local authorities to manage numbers.I believe Matt Hancock, when he spoke, was referring to the powers to impose localised lockdowns which we have been clear throughout may need to be the casewe see case numbers rise in a particular area.But the Twitter account for No promptly posted a tweet, warning people to stay socially distanced at Britains beaches. George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, said this morning: Clearly yesterday we had droves of people going to the beach in very large numbers, that was much more dficult. We do have powers to put in place closures should that be necessary.If it were necessary to do that to control the virus, then we would. We have the powers to do itneeded, just as we had the powers to do the lockdown. Shocking pictures of the aftermath of the crowds show the beach had been trashed with tins of rubbish, beer cans and glass bottles.Local authority staff were hard at work this morning trying to clean up the beach. When asked about the worrying scenes, a spokesman for the PM said: What I would say is that the PM and the Governments scientic and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice. Its only because of the publics hard work that weve been able to bring the virus under control.“If the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, then we will look at having to reverse some of the easements that we’ve put into place.And I dont think anyone in the British public would want for that to happen.When announcing that most of the lockdown measures would be lted next Saturday, Boris Johnson repeatedly stressed he would not hesitate to bring in local or national lockdowns in necessary. The fears over a second wave of coronavirus comes after The Sun revealed MPs have been worried about the risk of transmission on beaches for weeks. People blatantly disregarded social distancing rules over night as well, at illegal rave parties in London.

The aircraft touched the runway surface on its engines,” the inquiry found.In the wake of the crash Pakistan’s aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said that human error on the part of the pilot and co-pilot as well as air traffic control caused the plane crash.The pilot and co-pilot were not focused and throughout they were having a conversation about corona.The [virus] was on their minds. Their families were affected and they were having a discussion about it.Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan report catalogues a series of blunders made by the crew.Data from the flight recorders shows that the landing gear was selected as “down” during part of the planes descent.But later when the plane was much nearer to the ground the landing gear lever was selected as “up”. The reasons for this ‘gear up’ selection have not been determined cockpit-voice recordings reveal warnings that the landing-gear was not down were “disregarded”, says the inquiry.Air traffic controllers also failed to notice the wheels weren’t down.When the crew realised what had happened the pilots initially applied reverse-thrust and braking, as the engines scraped along the runway.They were unable to halt the plane to perform a ‘go around’ and take off as they belatedly put the landing gear down.The A initially climbed away, with its crew planning to make another approach but engines “failed one by one”, says the inquiry.The aircraft came down in a built-up area about ,m from the runway threshold.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You see a black Jesus, or a Chinese Jesus, or a Middle Eastern Jesus - which of course is the most accurate - or a Fijian Jesus, he said.His points were made in response to being askedthe “way the Western church portrays Jesus needs to be thought about again”.The clergyman told how monuments across the CofE, including Canterbury Cathedral, were being looked at “very carefully” to seethey all “should be there”. Rev Welby urged campaigners to show forgiveness for the “trespasses” of people immortalised in the form of statues, rather than tearing them down. He said: “We can only do thatweve got justice, which means the statue needs to be put in context.

The global animal welfare organisation is calling for all tourists to avoid captive elephant venues that offer these forms of interactions when tourism resumes post-coronavirus.“We are calling on the travel industry to revise their wildle policies and stop offering exploitative experiences to their customers,” Ben Pearson, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection, Australia said. “Elephant riding and other interactions, like shows and bathing, support acute animal cruelty.“We want to expose the true suffering elephants endure for a letime just so travellers can have their ‘once in a letime’ holiday experience.”Mr Pearson said that once travel opens up again, tourists should avoid such practices.“Tourism has come to a halt, but it will re-build, and this is the ideal opportunity to create a responsible and resilient future for wild animals,” he said. Another video released by the World Animal Protection shows three emaciated elephants that are forced to dance on their hind legs in front of a crowd of tourists.One elephant was forced to lt a tourist up with its trunk while visibly wincing in agony.It is tourists demands for such acts of “entertainment” that drives up the number of captive elephants in Asian countries. There are approximately , captive elephants that have undergone cruel training in Thailand alone.As a sustainable, long-term solution, World Animal Protection is advocating for a captive breeding ban on elephants to ensure future generations are spared this trauma.Elephant-friendly venues work on an observation-only model, not allowing direct interaction between elephants and tourists, but still providing jobs and a valuable income to local people such as elephant keepers, also known as mahouts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m worried the Government are taking their eye off the ball when it comes to the terror threat.“My message to them is, ‘Please do more to ensure no other families ever endure the hell we have’. ”NHS pharmacist Julie, , from Leeds, marked yesterday’s anniversary by releasing a balloon at her father’s grave.The last time she spoke to her dad, a retired power station worker, was Father’s Day in June , when they exchanged texts saying they loved each other.The pensioners, from Goole, East Yorks, who were married  years, had picked the five-star Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Sousse because they had stayed there before and it was close to the beach. They also believed it was safe.Julie says: “Before they flew to Tunisia, Mum and Dad had seen the news about the attack in Tunisia’s Bardo Museum months earlier. But dad had rung the tour operator and been assured it was safe to go.“When we swapped messages on Father’s Day I missed him but I knew they were having the time of their lives.”Five days after sending that message Julie was sitting in a restaurant in Leeds with her sister Sharon, , when a new text from her mum arrived. It said simply: “Ring me ASAP.”She says: “I called and Mum’s voice was shaking. She said, ‘We’ve been attacked. A gunman has been in the hotel and he’s shot your dad dead’.“My brain couldn’t process it. I looked at my sister, who told me my face had gone grey.”Julie ushered her sister outside. “I told her and she collapsed on to a bench,” Julie says. “It was a nice sunny day and people were walking past living their lives — but ours had stopped.”The details of what had unfolded in Tunisia were unimaginable. IS fanatic Seeddine Rezgui, , had stormed the resort in Sousse armed with a Kalashnikov assault rle, picking off victims in a killing spree that lasted almost  minutes.Julie says: “When the attack happened Mum and Dad had been lying by the pool sunbathing. Then, suddenly, they heard a bang.At first they thought someone was letting off fireworks. Then a man at the hotel shouted ‘Run!’ and screamed that a gunman was on the loose.”The couple fled but became separated in the chaos. When Rita got to the lobby, she saw an open door and went inside to take cover.Julie adds: “She could see the gunman through the crack. The sounds of gunfire were getting closer and Mum could hear the bullets.” When the gunfire stopped, Rita went to look for her husband.Julie says: “Mum went down the corridor and could see a body covered with a sheet. Then she saw some flip flops had been placed on top of the sheet and realised they were my dad’s.”Bungling officials made Rita’s ordeal worse when she arrived at the mortuary to identy her husband.Julie explains: “They laid out pictures of everyone that died. Mum had to look through them all until she got to Dad. Those pictures will haunt her for ever.“When Mum got home, and we met her at the airport, it just didn’t seem real. There were no words.”Julie said one of the hardest things was waiting for her dad to be ed home. Bruce, a devoted grandfather, was eventually repatriated around a week later on a flight to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Julie says: “When I saw that big grey plane it was awful. Then, one by one, the coffins were brought off. That sight will live with me for ever.”In the days that followed, Rita, , received her letter from Charles.“Our hearts go out to you more than you can possibly realise,” he wrote. Having lost my beloved Great Uncle, Lord Mountbatten, at the hands of IRA terrorists I can at least understand something of what you are going through.“It is beyond belief that someone could behave in such a brutal, callous and abominable way.”The family later met Charles and Camilla at the National Memorial Arboretum, in Staffs, where a memorial dedicated to British victims of overseas terrorism was unveiled.“Camilla was incredible with my mum,” Julie says. “She told her how deeply shocked she was. Both her and Charles wanted to make sure we’d been getting all the support we needed.”The family also met Prince Harry at a service last year to remember victims of the attack.Julie says: “He told us it was very important we made sure we were getting all the help we required to cope with the loss.”Julie adds: “For a long time there was anger but you eventually have to let go or it consumes you.“But forgiveness is not an option. We don’t speak his name. You don’t think something like that will ever happen to your own family. Losing our father in such a horric way is something we’ll never get over.”Julie says the incident on Saturday in Reading, where three people died, brought the nightmare back to le.“It stopped me in my tracks,” she says.“Those poor people who lost loved ones are now going to start the journey we’ve been on for the past five years. My heart goes out to them.” Julie fears lessons have not been learned from the Tunisia atrocity, adding: “My big fear, as we come out of lockdown, is there could be a move towards encouraging people to go back to places that aren’t safe. People that go over there, in my view are sitting targets.”Five years on from the attacks, Julie is angry that firmer advice wasn’t given to her father about the dangers in Tunisia.She said: “If my dad had been told there was any risk he wouldn’t have gone. He was the best dad any daughter could wish for.”Rezgui was shot dead by police and seven others were sentenced to le in prison last February.But Julie says there are still “unanswered questions”.She said: “Are all those responsible now in prison  I’d also like to knowany of the hotel staff were involved. Were they a part of the plot and are they still out there “I don’t think anything has changed in Tunisia. The hotel has been given a lick of paint and that’s it.

However, it remains unclear whether British nationals could be forced into self-isolation as they begin their holidays. The UK Government is still in talks with countries in a bid to persuade them not to quarantine UK tourists when they arrive. An official announcement is expected next week when the Prime Minister is expected to confirm deals for “air bridges” or “travel corridors” have been struck with some overseas governments. Britons would be able to begin their trips to those destinations the following week. A traffic light system will decide which nations are safe to travel to, with those classed as green or amber available to holidaymakers. Experts have studied how re coronavirus is within countries, whether the UK can trust their Covid- figures, and whether their infection rates are falling, climbing or flatlining. Britons holidaying in “green” or “amber” countries will not have to self-isolate for  days when they get back. But foreign governments could still look at Britainaposs death toll – the highest in Europe – and decide they want to quarantine arrivals from the UK. The Foreign Office will change its travel advice for certain nations. It has advised against all non-essential travel to anywhere in the world for more than three months.  A Government spokesman said: “Our public health measures at the border were put in place to manage the risk of imported cases and help prevent a second wave of the virus, and will continue to support our fight against coronavirus. “Our new risk-assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world, giving people the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad and boosting the UK economy through tourism and business. “But we will not hesitate to put on the brakesany risks re-emerge, and this system will enable us to take swt action to re-introduce self-isolation measuresnew outbreaks occur overseas.” The aviation and travel industries have been pleading with ministers to thrash out air bridges with countries where the risk of contracting Covid- is deemed low. Crisis-hit airlines have seen bookings tumble and announced plans for thousands of redundancies. The traffic light system, drawn up by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, come as the Government finishes the first review of its quarantine regime. The controversial scheme was introduced on June  by Home Secretary Priti Patel.  She claimed it would minimise the danger of arrivals from abroad bringing the infection to the UK. But critics said Britain had a higher rate of disease than many of the countries from which people were travelling. They insisted a -day isolation for foreign arrivals should have been introduced at least three months earlier when coronavirus was spreading around the globe. But the Government tonight insisted the quarantine system remained crucial to its hopes of avoiding a second wave of infections. People travelling from countries deemed at red risk of Covid- will still have to self-isolate on their arrival. All people arriving from abroad, including British nationals ing from countries deemed safer, will still have to supply their contact information so health officials can trace themsomeone they have been near, for example on a plane, displays symptoms or tests positive for Covid-.

Local families and young children had plenty of space to spread out on the sand compared to the chaotic scenes from yesterday when the beach was rammed. It was possible to take a comfortable stroll along the promenade without worrying about social distancing. Ice-cream kiosk workers were left twiddling their thumbs as there were barely any customers to serve. The slightly overcast weather has also helped keep the hordes of day-trippers away.  Roads which were gridlocked yesterday had a steady flow of traffic today and there were plenty of parking spaces available in the resortaposs car parks. Meanwhile, Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council revealed over  tonnes of rubbish that had been left strewn across the beach had ben cleared in the last  hours. Jill Beck, , a retired sales administrator from Bournemouth, said: The last couple of days were just madness. The amount of rubbish left was disgusting.   I think a lot of people are just selfish. I live here but I stayed away because there were too many people. Thataposs why Iaposve come down today, as I hoped the weather would keep people away.  The council and police have come under fire for not being prepared for the deluge of visitors on the hottest day of the year and for doing more to stop the influx. Retired English teacher Bryan McGuiness, , who has lived in Bournemouth for  years, said: It was disgusting. Weaposre in the middle of a pandemic yet , people came down - itaposs the height of stupidity. Why didnapost the police put up roadblocks to stop visitors. They surely should have expected it on the hottest day of the year. Iaposm sure weaposll see a surge of coronavirus cases because of it. One local business owner, which didnapost want to be named, said the council should have been better prepared after huge crowds flocked to Bournemouth on the end of May bank holiday. They said declaring a major incident was apospointlessapos as the police didnapost do anything to stop people coming to the beach. They said: The council should definitely have planned for this after what happened at the end of May. They should have blocked the roads and introduced larger fines for parking illegally. A £ fine for parking illegally in a spot which blocks ambulance access is not going to stop someone doing it. Declaring a major incident at pm was absolutely pointless. The police didnapost stop anyone coming on the beach, or remove people. There was no big announcement. There was no contingency plan in place from what I could see. Mark Cribb, who runs the Urban Beach hotel and Urban Reef restaurant in Bournemouth, fears the events of yesterday will put staycationers off from coming this summer. He described the councilaposs decision to declare a major incident as an over-reaction which trigged negative worldwide headlines.  He said: People are being encouraged not to go abroad this year and take a staycation instead and Bournemouth is one of the premier resorts in the country that will capitalise on that. Butyou were sat at home in the Midlands watching the images of people sat on top of each other on the beach surrounded by the police you are probably going to be put off booking a holiday here. You always get pockets of people around Bournemouth Pier in a  metre area but we have  miles of beach here and the rest of it wasnapost crowded yesterday. The council need better inform people that there is plenty of space where when the area around the pier is full. Maybe in the future they can be better prepared by setting up a flexible park and ride facility on the edge of the town at short notice for when a hot weekend is forecast. But for the council to declare a major incident which led to a load of police officers arriving on the beach to deal with a large family having an ice cream I felt was an overreaction. The response was like a nuclear war had been declared. I had relatives in Australia contact me to ask what was happening. David Morley, chairman of the Sandbanks Community Group, said the council should have done more to prepare for the influx after the last extremely busy day they had in May.  He called on the council to put more temporary seasonal resources into things like rubbish collection to prevent the recent scenes happening again. Mr Morley has sent a seven-point plan to the council chief executive outlining what he thinks needs to be put in place. He said: I think the council had their head in the sand, it was inevitable this was going to happen after the last one. They have had four weeks to prepare and they did not use that time well. They underestimated the scale of the task and we have a lot of questions.  What was interesting was once they declared the major incident within an hour the place was flooded with police who quickly got a grip of it - sorted the traffic and got rid of troublemakers. The attitude of all these people who had driven from Birmingham and London and parked illegally was apositaposs a £ fine, so what, thataposs fine for a dayaposs parking at the beach.apos From the moment the council realised itaposs going to be a very busy day - and you can tell in advance by the weather forecast - they have got to have a signicant police presence to control access and use their discretionary powers. They need to close the car park when itaposs full and keep it closed and they should have a tow away policy and aggressively remove any cars parked illegally. Itaposs got to be zero tolerance because as soon as one car parks on double yellow lines they all think they can do it. Yesterday Banks Road had cars parked on both sides of the road all the way down so emergency vehicles could not get through. We want to work with the council but itaposs dficult when they wonapost engage with us. The council said they did a good job yesterday but I think a lot of people at Sandbanks would disagree, it was like a war zone. The misery people went through for almost  hours was unbelievable, it was lawless.

The Mirror can reveal the “development manager” is a company which has donated £, to the Tories. It is run by Ian Livingstone, who the Prime Minister appointed to the board of his Mayor’s Fund for London. Mr Johnson approved the original plans for the East London site during his final days as Mayor of the capital.

She writes: A girl went up to Meghan, introduced herself, and said how beautul she thought she was. She said she knew it was Meghanaposs birthday and wished her a happy birthday. Meghan looked at her asshe had committed a great faux pas by speaking to her and walked off. It was so cold. Another girl told Meghan how much she admired her, and how wonderful she thought she was that she and Harry were married and how well she thought she was doing. She told her she was rooting for them and wished them well. Meghanaposs response  She looked her up and down, turned away without saying a word her out for the rest of the wedding breakfast.Meghan wore a £ Club Monaco navy blue short-sleeved dress featuring a pleated colour block skirt and matching fascinator.The shoes were from Aquazzura, a popular brand for the Duchess who wore shoes from the same designer on the evening of her own wedding day.

In the book, Lady C also claims that Meghan is hoping to run for president.It is expected to cause controversy, and even saw Phillip Scofield and Holly Willoughby row with Lady C during a This Morning interview earlier this week.Holly asked Lady Cit was harder to write a biography with no input from the people it is about, and she replied: If you know anything about writing biographies, or what is regarded as a good biography, you have minimum input from the person you are writing about. If youaposre writing an impartial proper biography, you speak to everyone around them who really know them, you do not need, unless youaposre a minister of propaganda, to have input from the person. Phillip said after her salacious book about Princess Diana, he could not imagine that any of the royals would want to speak to Lady C anyway.

Senior scientists advising ministers are convinced new infections are “flat, maybe up a bit” in recent weeks and are calling on Brits not to assume “it’s party time”. They remain at around , new confirmed cases a day as newly released Sage papers suggest ministers may agree this is an “acceptable incidence” level. Scientists on the Independent Sage group announced that staying at current levels would lead to an extra , deaths. It comes as the Government is about to initiate a major further lting of lockdown measures reopening pubs and allowing larger groups to meet up. A senior Government scientic adviser said: “This is not party time, this is time to go very carefully with these new release of measures.” He added: “Determining acceptable incidence is a matter for Government.” The Office for National Statisticssurveillance study estimated on Thursday that new infections were steady at more than , a day in the last fortnight for which data is available. They had been falling since April. However this was contradicted by separate figures published by the Government that cases were still falling at between % and % a day. The uncertainty came on a day images were taken around the country of packed beaches and violent street gatherings. The Government adviser said: “It’s quite possible this is a true flattening and it might be down to increased contacts.” Looking at the number of confirmed cases following a positive test, there are around , new cases a day.  More papers were released by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieson Friday including a draft note dated May . It recommended: “Decreasing daily incidence of symptomatic cases in all regions across the UK until the target acceptable incidence is reached, then incidence kept below that target. “This target is yet to be specied and needs to be spelt out. We suggest , new symptomatic swab +ve cases per day in the UK.” It then added that this acceptable level would be “policy decision”. It comes after latest daily deaths of people after testing positive were at  on Thursday. This took the official UK death toll to ,.  The Independent Sage group of scientists yesterday told an online media briefing yesterday Britain was lting lockdown too soon and could follow the US in triggering a huge new spike. Prof Christina Pagel, of University College London, said: “New daily infections have stopped their downward trend and have been level for the last few weeks. “I think Chris Whitty said recently that he was expecting this kind of level to carry on for about another nine months in to next year. “If we carry on with  to  deaths a day that’s over , deaths. “I think we really, really need to keep that downward trend.” It also estimated that NHS Test and Trace is only reaching a third of symptomatic Covid- cases and obtaining details of contacts.

It comes amid the biggest shake-up of our elite force since the Second World War, aimed at creating a “much more lethal” spearhead. Under the Future Commando Force programme, the troops will integrate more closely with the Royal Navy to form high-readiness coastal attack units. They will blitz enemy lines to carve out a path for main forces or form raiding parties on counter-terror missions. They will also disperse to operate over a greater area to avoid being large targets. And they have been given the kit needed to face modern challenges in the form of a unorm that is light, tough and quick-drying. The design also underlines the unit being part of the Navy, carrying the Royal Navy White Ensign, while recognising commando heroics in the Second World War with the traditional commando dagger patch. The NATO-procured unorm is % lighter, has three times higher tear-strength and is % faster-drying and four times more breathable than the previous unorm.  Major General Matt Holmes, Commandant General of the Royal Marines, said the troops wearing the kit will be at the forefront of any future theatre of war. He said: “We see ourselves as in the first wave and a global deployable force at a very high readiness. The way we will operate in future is threat-driven but it plays well to go back to our commando roots. “The concept is littoralstrike, based on us exploiting the maritime environment. That’s why we are increasingly integrating with the Royal Navy.

He told the PA news agency: Usually in the winter when we have hail it is quite small, but this time of the year, because the heat gives the thunderstorms more energy and helps keep the hail stones up in the clouds for longer, they get to grow more and then fall from the sky. A Met Office spokesman said: Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out on Friday afternoon and evening. Many places will miss the storms, but where they do occur, torrential downpours could bring - mm rain in a hour, with hail and lightning. The storms will slowly clear northeastwards on Friday afternoon and into the evening, though will probably not clear northeast Scotland until Saturday morning. A Met Office rain warning has also been issued for tomorrow, with flooding of homes and roads expected. The alert will be in force from am to pm across all of Scotland, with up to mm of rain expected to fall within a few hours. The warning states: Although intense thunderstorms become less likely for most areas across Scotland and Northern Ireland, heavy showers and more prolonged rain will continue at times, still with the possibility of thunder.

It clearly isn’t. Documents show the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick signed off the development by Tory donor Richard Desmond even though his own officials advised against it. They also show Mr Jenrick hurried along the decision knowing it would save the billionaire from having to pay £million that would have benefited one of Britain’s poorest areas. Today the Mirror reveals that one of the other key players behind the development is another Tory donor with close links to the PM. If Mr Johnson wants to draw a line under the issue he needs to come clean. Downing Street is refusing to say what communications the Prime Minister or any of his aides had with Mr Desmond. The more Mr Johnson tries to sweep this under the carpet the more it will seem that his party is willing to do cash for favours. Save our shops The collapse of shopping centre giant Intu is another reminder of the tough times facing the retail sector. Its problems pre-date the virus with online sales surging and loss of rents after stores shut. Thousands of jobs are now at risk, not just at Intu itself, but at stores in its premises. Some big name centres should find buyers. The concern is for Intu’s properties in smaller towns and cities.

Starlink explained: “With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet, and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable.”However, several astronomers have raised concerns that one of the satellites, which are solar-powered and usually orbit around  miles above Earth, could pass in front of a telescope and obscure an image.

Willow Dunn, four, who had Down syndrome, was found dead at a property in Brisbane, Australia. Police say her body was in an advanced state of decomposition lying in a cot and has been partially eaten by rats when they entered the rental property. The little girlaposs father Mark James Dunn, , and stepmother Shannon Leigh White, , have both been charged with her murder.Dunn alleged he found his daughter face down in her cot. He was later arrested. Heartbreaking pictures show the little girlaposs teddy bear dressed in a Parramatta Eels rugby team jersey in the window of the home. An abandoned pram was left outside the front lawn as forensic teams scoured the scene for more clues about her death. A train set, teddy bears and a childaposs pink play castle were among toys left by the roadside. An investigation is underway to determineWillow starved to death and was denied medication.  A post-mortem examination concluded Willow was experiencing serious malnourishment and other health issues that indicated sustained mistreatment. It also alleged she had scalp burns and bone-deep infected hip sores. Willow grew up without her biological mother - who died in childbirth - and lived with Dunn, as well as a stepmother and stepsister in their rented home.  The Department of Child Safety has confirmed it had been in touch with the family in relation to the tragic child, but has reportedly refused to give any further details. LNP shadow police minister Dan Purdie told the Courier Mail: The big question in such a horric case of alleged neglect is how a vulnerable young child has slipped through the cracks and how this could have been prevented. Neighbours, some of whom have laid tributes outside the home, have reportedly claimed they had never seen Willow, despite the family having lived at the property for a year.  Dunn was charged under a new definition of murder in Queensland aimed at child-killers, which includes reckless indference to human le. Two ambulances and multiple police cars were seen parked at the home following the discovery, with a crime scene established. The following day investigators ed to further examine the home and gather forensic swabs, it is reported.

Distinctive Sunny Dundee signage is being deployed, to encourage people to queue safely and follow one-way pedestrian flows.“We’ll be ensuring that regular cleaning takes place in public areas and providing options for people to get around, including more cycle paths and pedestrian areas. In all of this, the safety of the public and workers is paramount.#Councillor Mark Flynn, depute convener of City Development, said: “We know how much people have missed the things we once took for granted – an afternoon at the shops, going out for a coffee or a meal and a few drinks.“The work we and businesses are doing is about giving people the confidence that they can start to enjoy these activities safely as the easing of lockdown continues.#The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Measures taking place include pedestrianisation, pavement widening, temporary bike lanes, and one-way walking.Aberdeen City Council transport spokeswoman Councillor Sandra Macdonald said: “I’m pleased that we have a week to consult the public on our plans for the beach area.“I’d encourage people particularly those who live or work in the north of the city to take part in the questionnaire as this will help us to shape the final plans – we’ve already made changes in other projects thanks to suggestions from local people so we’d really like to hear your views.”The Bicycle Association revealed yesterday that sales of bicycles rose by % in the UK in April, as people scrambled to find an alternative way to get around after use of public transport was discouraged.Projects in Aberdeen will be aimed to rapidly expand and connect cycling infrastructure across the city to create an improved cycle network, including the beach active travel corridor which is from the city centre to Bridge of Don.Feedback from the public is being taken into consideration to help shape these plans.

It is with thanks to people#s support and generosity that we can actively plan and prepare for this vital community resource to re-open. We look forward to welcoming all friends of Easter Anguston back to the farm in autumn.”The charity has appealed for support to continue from the public while it prepares for reopening.There are five staff working on the site along with  trainees and a group of volunteers.Jenner added: #Covid- has had a profound impact on thousands of people, businesses and charities across the UK, sadly as a result of the ongoing pandemic it has adversely impacted the income we would normally receive from our fantastic visitors who visit the farm. This voluntary income enables us to offer this wonderful community visitor experience without having to charge any entrance fee.#For many people across the area, the farm provides an opportunity for them to access a visitor experience with their children when they would not be in a financial position to have a family day out to fee-paying visitor attractions. For many children, it is often the first time they have experienced being in the countryside, seeing animals up close, or the first time they have walked in woodland or been able to play outdoors.#It is vital to the physical and mental well being of the families we support at the farm, that we are in a financial position to be able to continue to offer access to this visitor experience without having to charge an entry fee. Many families will be adversely financially impacted as a result of perhaps losing their jobs during the pandemic.#At VSA we have seen a signicant increase in demand for our help and support across all of our services, and we know that thousands of families will be relying on us, to get the farm back open as soon as possible to help support their well being.The charity added its main priority at the moment was ensuring its adult trainees were comfortable with some of the measures introduced for social distancing and making sure they are safely re-introduced to their learning and development programmes before the farm reopens.At the moment, the team are busy preparing autumn and Halloween activities for families being welcomed back to the farm.Anyone who would like to make a donation to VSA#s Easter Anguston Farm is asked to do so either on its website vsa.org.uk or cheques can also be sent to VSA,  Castle Street, Aberdeen, AB YU.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Now we have modern facilities, I think it is somewhere players want to be.”Having Cormack Park has undoubtedly helped with the transition back from the coronavirus shutdown.Aberdeen have been back at socially-distanced training for nearly two weeks now.The club secured a Covid- testing machine, which they have on site to produce regular and rapid testing.There are also daily temperature checks. Players do not have access to the building at Cormack Park yet.McInnes admits it is an alien and strange environment for players, but has praised them for the way they have rapidly adapted.He said: “The players have been fantastic and as a club everything has gone really smoothly.“The players have had to adapt, but they have done it well. The staff planned it well, the medical staff have ensured everyone canproperly.“It’s strange that you don’t have the contact with them.“They arrive in their cars, wait until they get tested and then wander out inidually.“We have been working in two groups at the minute, last week it was three groups, so you are doing the same sessions.“It’s quite taxing, but it’s enjoyable to be back.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Now we find the bullying problem here is equally as bad.The survey results have particular impact and resonance at this point in time, given the dedication of health and care staff during the coronavirus crisis.This type of behaviour has been anecdotally reported for years, so is not a huge shock, but it is nonetheless disgraceful.Apologies are of little use. Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week. They deserve the attention, but communities across Argyll equally merit praise for their kindness and community spirit.Again, it comes as little surprise.That#s the way we do it in Argyll."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert spruced up and ready for tee off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMembers will come back # in good time # to a spruced up and tidy Glenralloch.Maintenance and improvement work has carried on at Tarbert Golf Club in line with current guidelines.The committee reports the course is in immaculate condition with  greenkeeper Graham Prentice on top of things.The greens were hollow-cored earlier in the year and are gradually filling in and some welcome heat and rainwill enhance the greens.Other #rainy day# jobs have been carried out by volunteer members, which has helped the overall appearance of the course.Club secretary John MacNab successfully applied for the small business grant.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor. Just find some space, make some tasty treats and connect with friends and family online.Although we are all still respecting social distancing and cannot meet in groups, we can still share experiences together and create happy memories.  And when lockdown finally ends we can do it all again, but this time in person.To find out more and to get your free pack, visit the Family Action website.David Holmes CBE, Family Action Chief Executive Officer, London"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll golf clubs tee off as lockdown eases","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs across the region are planning to re-open on a limited basis on Friday May , following the latest Scottish Government guidance.Lochgilphead Golf Club#s course will be open to members only in the first instance and members must pre-book tee times in line with Scottish Golf guidelines.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

lsquoextended householdrsquo.She said the Scottish Government was mindful of the ldquowider harms that come from the restrictions put in place to tackle the coronavirus ndash including ldquoloneliness and isolation, particular for older people living alone and lone parents.And while the idea of an extended household has wide-ranging benefits, therersquos one aspect in particular, sometimes dubbed a ldquosex bubble, that has people talking.The new arrangements, permitted from today, means that non-cohabiting couples - where at least one of them lives alone - can be reunited indoors without social distancing for the first time in three months.What can I do under an lsquoextended household rsquoWithin an extended household group, people will be able to meet indoors, without physical distancing and stay overnight - though onlythey wish.But they must continue to see any other households outdoors only, and stay more than  metres apart from them.Who can form one Only people who live alone, or who live only with children under -years-old, can form an extended household.The idea is it could allow, for example, a grandparent who lives on their own to form a group with another household in their family.It will allow a single parent and their children to join with another household for support.And, of course, couple who live apartcan be reunited and stay over.But, an important detail to note: people who are shielding cannot form an extended household.Can I have more than one extension No. A person should not form an extended household with more than one other household.Can I leave my

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react.

ldquoOne of the main problems in this case is one of supply.ldquoThe substance can feel quite easy to get hold of, but this is absolutely no indicator that it is safe.ldquoIt is extremely dangerous, especially for those with undiagnosed or asymptomatic illnesses.ldquoYoung people who are abusing it are taking huge risks themselves and for their friends as well.ldquoOne of the problems is that there are legitimate uses for the capsules, especially in the catering industry.ldquoThere needs to be a well-rounded approach to tackling this latest trend, involving education, support from the

Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back. Which would be most interesting at a conference or reception ndash assuming we ever have them again.Professor Linda Bauld, of Public Health at Edinburgh University says politicians should ldquonot to get too hung up about distance. There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule. Public transport becomes unmanageable, tourism is undermined, shops and offices stay closed. We are a gregarious species and trying to keep two metres away from our fellow man and woman is extraordinarily dficult.Children are not observing anything like a two metre rule in parks and gardens, as is only too obvious. It seems absurd therefore that they should be prevented from attending well managed and clean schools where the risk will be very much less.:CMO warnshealthboards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityMany parents were outraged at Mr Swinneyrsquos ldquoblended learning plans, with some pupils getting as little as a day of teaching per week. They made their feelings very plain to the Deputy First Minister and he appears to have got the message.Mr Swinney is now sounding more bullish than Boris Johnson about reopening the schools full time from August th.

He grew up in Yorkshire and signed for Hull when he was . He might then have stayed on at Hull and had a great career there, but he left, and played in America, then came to Scotland where Kilmarnock wanted him, then went off to Canada and lots of other places and none of it ever felt very comfortable for him and a big part of the reason for that was his sexuality.But now, this week, Thomas has gone public, making him only the second male professional footballer in the UK to reveal hersquos gay. Without doubt, itrsquos an important step for sport and for LGBT equality, but because Thomas retired in , it doesnrsquot actually change the fact that there still isnrsquot a single out gay man playing in the professional game in Britain. There was Justin Fashanu in the s, but thatrsquos it.The fact Thomas has waited until now to talk openly is understandable: when, who, andgay people reveal their sexuality is up to them, but the problem is that the football industry was, and is, unwelcoming for gay men. Watfordrsquos captain Troy Deeney said the other day that every football team is likely to have a gay player. The fact that not a single one of them is public tells you everything you need to know.The problem boils down to three parts: players, management, and the fans, and the pressure they are exerting, possibly unconsciously, on players to stay silent. Right across the game, people are making assumptions about what football is and what masculinity is and how the two interact and gay men are picking it up from a very early age.Take the players first. Thomas Beattie says that when he signed as a youth professional with Hull, the senior players took him to a strip club as an initiation. The other players assumed Thomas would enjoy a strip club they had assumed he was heterosexual. He also says he heard gay slurs in the changing room, although he doesnrsquot think the players were being malicious ndash they were saying it because they assumed there was no one in the room to be hurt or offended.Management is also a problem. Thomas says therersquos still an assumption that a gay player would disrupt the team, in the same way that the British Army used to assume a gay soldier would lead to the army losing wars because it was too gay. Thomas also believes that, because society generally is getting better, managers assume homophobia isnrsquot an issue in football either and therefore do nothing.Then therersquos the fans. Can we be confident thatThomas had stayed on at Kilmarnock or Hull or any other team and had come out as gay that he wouldnrsquot have faced abuse from the fans  Thomas says he felt like society was telling him the world of being gay and being a footballer were enemies andyoursquore a football fan, it might be worth asking yourself what assumptions you make. Have you ever thought, for example, thata man is gay he probably canrsquot kick a ball All of these assumptions played their part in making Thomas unhappy and, although they donrsquot necessarily translate into outright abuse, they do the job just as well. You canrsquot be gay and a footballer. Being gay will be bad for the team. Yoursquore a footballer therefore you love the ladies.The solution is for everyone in the game to check their assumptions. Thomas puts it this way: be conscious of the environment yoursquore creating and whether it lets everyone feel included. When a new player joins the team, do not assume theyrsquore straight. Maybe a few players will be offended by this, but gay players will feel more welcome and more able in the long run to go public.Everyone should also listen to what Thomas Beattie says about the longer term consequences of football failing to change. ldquoDo not fear the day where a gay athlete is wearing the badge on your shirt, he says. ldquoFear the prolonged period of time when there isnt. In other words, football could be missing out on great players, but even worse than that: as society and other sports progress, football is going to look more out-of-date on the issue of sexuality and ndash letrsquos just say it ndash homophobic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Three aspects appear todayndash iety, soil type and fertiliser, two of which I have covered over the years but to no avail. Despite using Epicure seed and a load of cattle dung delivered from a local farmer I have never been able to replicate that elusive flavour, leaving me in no doubt that the soil type that exist in coastal areas such as Ayrshire, Wigtownshire and Bute is also a critical factor.Duncan Miller, Lenzie.I AGREE with Murray Gowiewholeheartedly.

Ma Stewart, being of a certain age, had to stay at home and avoid the grocery store so Ive been doing her shopping every week since the lockdown. In the run up to Easter, little extras appeared on the shopping list, such as yellow food colouring or baking powder.Id almost entire forgotten I was due a birthday until, about three weeks before, icing sugar was suddenly requested. Each ingredient meant for a celebration cake, buried in the list weeks in advance.Back in March, as it became clear that something momentous was afoot, items began disappearing from supermarket shelves. Among the many things seared in the national memory from this extraordinary time will be the Great Loo Roll Rush of .Tinned items soon followed. Beans, soup, canned tuna - good luck to you. Soap, hand sanitiser, bleach. Practical items for people planning to be stuck at home with mouths to feed and germs to kill.If the whole toilet paper panic was inexplicable, what came next was logical but still a bit of a surprise. Where was all the flour The supermarkets had none, and when they did get some in stock there was a frantic rush on it. People were sharing tips in community Facebook pages about where had a supply in stock and offering to trade it, like a finely milled currency.Ditto yeast. Photographs of sachets of yeast appeared on these social media pages too, offers to post it out at inflated prices or do contactless handovers in odd places in exchange for a bag of self-raising.Twitter became one long thread of sourdough starter discussions. How to get them going, how to keep them going, how to move on when the frothing stopped and the starter ended.There were people giving names to their starters , posting photos of them on social media, even creating Instragram accounts solely for their off-white pots of yeast.Even simple homebaking has an air of performance in the age of social media but then, people are bored at home and a few tweets is as decent a use of time as anything .As bulk buyers left the baking aisle bare, millers were working around the clock, genuinely milling flour  hours a day, seven days a week, to keep up with demand. Usually, two million bags of flour are produced every week but during lockdown this doubled to four million.Interestingly, it wasnt the lack of flour that was the problem: it was the lack of packaging. There werent enough small bags to keep up with demand and not enough capacity to pack them.In my local supermarket things came to such a pass that, not only were the flour shelves bare, the shop eventually removed the shelves too so there was an empty cavity where they had previously been.Perhaps this was to quash quickly any rising anticipation that maybe some flour existed tucked away at the back.As the baking trend continued to rise, supermarkets innovated. Some sold kg bags of flour and, incredibly, people bought them. Other stores decanted the kg sacks into smaller brown paper bags and let shoppers have them for p or so.Of course, local corner stores had flour all along, as well as all the other staples wed been scrambling to grab in the big stores. A friend would come to my local shop for his flour and leave with several bags of self-raising only after standing through a lecture in Middle Eastern politics from the chatty shopkeeper.Lockdown has meant an increase in time and an increase in time has meant the ability to use local shops, a trend we should hope continues.But the baking thing. What was it about  Time, again. Our lives are built now around work. Where my grandmothers generation of women would routinely be at home with the children, and where baking was an everyday staple, our economic model now depends on both parents working and those kitchen skills have slid away.Baking bread or cakes, once a chore to work through, has become a romanticised task - all about self-care and mindfulness, as much as the basic need for sustenance. Keeping a sourdough starter alive takes work and commitment, regular feeding. AndInstragram is to be believed, regular conversations with your frothing paste.A sourdough loaf must be done in strict, timed stages, giving shape to the day. Eventhats all you do from morning til night, those otherwise wayward hours are structured.Baking bread takes mental and physical focus, kneading, folding, a patient wait for rise. Folding again. The smell of baking bread as the chemistry of heat does its thing, an edible science experiment. You are in control of transforming a selection of basic ingredients into something wonderful, something solid when all  is shting and unpredictable.I have always enjoyed baking. It is a small act of love to create something delicious for someone  and, while I do resist the notion of self-care, being a grizzled old cynic, its satisfying to bake yourself a treat.This has been quite a boon of lockdown easing - friends keep showing up with home baking. Early on there were brownies left on my doorstep. Ma Stewart has made me beautul cakes with her carefully squirrelled away ingredients. My friend Dan dropped me off a picnic for my birthday with two fresh baguettes hed made, another lockdown baking convert.Another birthday gt was an extraordinary ice cream cake, three flavours wrapped in a giant chocolate chip brownie casing. Ive been gted several fresh loaves from neighbours who overestimated what they needed.To bake and be baked for are both basic and exalted things at once. Before, it was a question of fitting baking into our busy lives. Now we structure days around baking.

Every single one of our  local authorities has had cases of trafficking or exploitation. In , there were over  cases of people being trafficked or exploited in Scotland. That number looks set to rise this year. And without question there are many more cases that have gone unreported.Modern slavery takes many forms. Its victims are both men and women, adult and child. There are cases of both sexual and labour exploitation. Its victims can be born-and-bred in Scotland, have moved here years ago, or only just arrived. Modern slavery takes place in our cities, towns, villages and countryside. Often, it takes place in plain sight.All over Scotland, there are women trafficked into sexual exploitation, forced into prostitution by traffickers. They work in appalling conditions, at great risk, terrorised and traumatised by their traffickers and the men who pay for sex. Other victims have been found working for illegally low wages ndashthey are paid at all ndash in nail bars, car washes, construction sites, and where.:Behind closed doors, gangrsquos family traded in victimsrsquo miseryThey have their wages withheld, and their lack of English and support networks is exploited. Other victims are locked into dangerous environments to cultivate cannabis plants, used by their exploiters to transport drugs around the country, or forced to beg on our streets.It gets worse. Despite causing dficulties for us all, the coronavirus lockdown is a gt to traffickers. Many victims are being forced by their traffickers to take greater risks than ever. They may be forced to work in conditions without social distancing, or prevented from accessing healthcare, or be compelled to take risks with their health to earn money for their traffickers.And the lockdown has made it harder for us to find those people who need our help: their traffickers have moved them off the streets, and public services are stretched as we deal with the coronavirus crisis.Furthermore, councils are increasingly concerned that the economic impact of the crisis will make even more people vulnerable to exploitation. Thousands of people in Scotland have lost their job, or seen their incomes disappear.Traffickers will be moving in, to prey on the most vulnerable: forcing them to work in unsafe conditions or for illegal wages, or by tricking people into a debt they have to work to pay off, but never can. Furthermore, many migrants in Scotland have lost their job in the crisis. Even those who are entitled to benefits may not know their rights, or how to negotiate our systems of public support, and they may not have developed personal support networks of their own. The risk of exploitation is great.More must be done to protect victims, and potential victims, from modern slavery ndash and we all have a role to play.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist.

Elaine Tulloch, chief executive of Destination Orkney Ltd, said: “We were delighted with the response our recent call to action received from our -strong membership. The four new directors, who have now been co-opted onto our board, bring a range of valuable skills and experience to the table and we very much look forward to working with them during these critical months ahead. “Having a strong board presence, which is fully representative of the trade, is essential as we develop recovery plans with local partners, agencies and regional and national governments.”Orkney’s tourism industry, worth over £ million a year to the islands’ economy, has been hard hit by the COVID- crisis.During the pandemic, Destination Orkney Ltd has been keeping its members up to date with information on COVID- support and available funding streams, offering guidance, and lobbying locally and nationally, while sharing updates from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Scottish Government, VisitScotland and other national bodies.In order to develop COVID- Orkney recovery plans with partners, Destination Orkney Ltd has also established an industry recovery group to discuss matters such as reopening, communication and marketing, as well as identying future resource and investment needs and opportunities. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households.

This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis.

The Deputy First Minister said that, when the part-time #blended# plan for schooling had been developed, he and his colleagues could not have anticipated such an improvement in infection levels. The #blended# model will remain a contingency plan, should infection rates dramatically increase or progress against the virus slow.#I must stress that this is the aim the government is working towards, but it remains conditional on scientic and health advice,# Mr Swinney explained.#If we continue to make progress on the route we envisage, we may have successfully achieved — or be well on the way to achieving — Phase Four.#It is this more positive outlook that means the Scottish Government can make this updated planning assumption for schools.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise.

perspex shields, proactive testing of teachers and an appropriate level of physical distancing between pupils and most certainly between pupils and staff, alongside continued protections for vulnerable groups.”Mr Swinney revealed that an additional £ million will be invested over the next two years to tackle the impact of lockdown on schools and pupils, including ensuring every current probationer teacher who meets the standard for full registration having a teaching post for the year ahead.Education Scotland has also agreed to work with E-Sgoil, the digital training  pioneered in the Western Isles, to develop a national e-learning provision for all senior phase pupils to access lessons online from qualied teachers.Mr Swinney said: “Since May, because of the efforts of ordinary people to stay at home, we have seen Scotland make signicant progress.“There are now only around  infectious people in Scotland – a reduction of around  per cent since May.“There has been a sustained downward trend in Covid- deaths since the end of -th April, and intensive care cases now stand at a fraction of what they were.“If we stay on track,we all continue to do what is right, andwe can further suppress this terrible virus, then the government believes that we should prepare for children to be able toto school full time from August.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown.

Undoubtedly a major part of the reason has been the common sense of the public which has helped to dramatically curtail the spread of the coronavirus.However, it would not seem too much of a stretch of imagination to suggest that strong lobbying from ious sectors of the economy has also hastened the relaxations. Essentially, the new normal will be largely in place by the end of August, while earlier it had been anticipated that some sectors would not be ing until possibly December.The move to reduce social distancing from two metres to one from Monday carries an obviously greater risk of infection being spread. It is not only the distance involved, but also the time spent in the company of another person at that distance which multiplies the risk factor.The timing of the reopening of some facilities - for example betting shops, tattoo parlours, spas and massage and therapy facilities coming at least  days earlier than reopening libraries - seems a trle strange, although the economic benefit of the commercial premises is obvious.It would be churlish not to congratulate the Executive for its determination to get the economy ing again to some extent as quickly as possible. The politicians clearly have listened to business interests and put the ball in their court.It must also be recognised that the relaxation of the rules is accompanied by a health warning. Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was clear that action would be takenthere was any indication that infections were spiking again, especially as we head towards the winter months, which is always a danger period, pandemic or no pandemic.The public and the business owners must continue to show the common sense and adherence to basic hygiene rules which have worked so far in containing the virus.

That app is also based on the toolkit provided by Apple and Google.A Department of Health spokesperson told the BBC: The Health Minister has commissioned work to develop a proximity app, based on the de-centralised Google  Apple model, for use in Northern Ireland.This work includes examining the interoperability of apps and the sharing of information across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has warned people against taking liberties with social distancing rules as he said it could lead to the danger of a serious spike in coronavirus infections. The comments come after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Government will take actiondistancing measures are ignored as thousands flocked to the south coast on the hottest day of the year. Speaking during a visit to a restaurant in east London ahead of an easing of lockdown on July , the Prime Minister said: If you look at what#s happening where in the world where people have been coming out of lockdown, I#m afraid what you#re also seeing is people taking too many liberties with the guidance, mingling too much, not observing social distancing. So in some parts of the world - I won#t name them - you have got spikes, really serious spikes, in the instance of the disease, so it is crucial that people understand that on July  we get this right, we do this in a balanced way. Despite Mr Hancock#s warning of possible beach closures, Downing Street signalled such a move would be a matter for local authorities.

Chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty later urged people to follow social distancing rules in the hot weather or risk causing a spike in coronavirus. He wrote on Twitter: If we do not follow social distancing guidance then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Unity of Purpose group was in the news earlier this month when it called for the postponement of a Black Lives Matter rally which was held in Derrys Guildhall Square on June . In a statement, which was issued through the City Centre Initiative in Derry, the group said they understood and supported the reasons for the rally, but added that they believed it should be called off due to public safety concerns in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. However, despite the appeal, the rally went ahead and police subsequently issued  fines to people taking part in the protest. googletag.cmd.push In its recent statement, a spokesperson for theUnityofPurposegroup said it consists of local MPs, MLAs, the Mayor and statutory and business leaders within Derry. In the wake of the Black Lives Matters rally,Shaun Harkin and Eamonn McCann, People Before Profit councillors on the local council, criticised the stance of the Unity of Purpose group and called for the group to disband. The Unity of Purpose group did not respond to the councillors criticisms. Speaking at todays monthly meeting of the council, independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused the group of being very very selective on what they comment on. There have been a lot things that have happened in this city during the time that this group has been about and they have issued no statements. he said. googletag.cmd.push My concern is that they are not accountable, they dont respond and there is a council connection that I am deeply concerned about. I have seen photographs with councillors and I have seen photographs with council officers and I want to try and get some clarication on that. I want clarication on funding. Do we fund them directly or indirectly  I know there is a link to them through the City Centre Initiative. Far from saying what they say they do on the tin, their actions have led to people becoming more marginalised and excluded, added Cllr Donnelly. Speaking at todays meeting, Councillor Eamonn McCann described the Unity of Purpose group as a faceless organisation. He said it was unusual that there no inidual names attached to the recent statement issued by the group. Does this group have a policy document that we can look at  Does it have a constitution  Does it have a set of aims or a mission statement  Becausewe dont see that we are unable to work out in what way the opposition to the Black Lives Matter rally comes within their remit, said Cllr McCann. Cllr Donnelly proposed that the council carry out a report into connections between the council and the Unity of Purpose group. The matter was put to a vote and the proposal was carried, after  councillors voted to support it. Six councillors voted against the proposal.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in

unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a
