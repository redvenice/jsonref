The rugged surface of Van Gogh’s Sunflowers, as if scarred by the passion with which he loaded each brush stroke, gives this painting a substantial and organic presence that can be felt almost as strongly on the National Gallery’s website as in its real presence. (The Sunflowers were put under quarantine in Tokyo in late February, as part of 60 masterpieces on tour.) It would be fatuous right now to show some escapist summer scene as a pick-me-up. Van Gogh’s joy in these yellow flowers, however, has a hard-won, desperate quality. He painted them soon after fleeing Paris, where drink and despair were killing him, for the south of France. He found a little house he liked in Arles, and painted a series of sunflower decorations all saturated, this one perhaps most of all, with his sheer wonder at a southern light and heat he’d never experienced before.

But now, they’re seeing unmanageable losses,” said chief executive Nicola Solomon. “It was clear that current levels of funding would fail to meet needs.”Author Philip Pullman, the society’s president, said that the pandemic was making it “impossible” for authors to do their work, as much of it consisted of lecturing, visiting schools and teaching.“When part of the crisis consists of not knowing enough about the crisis itself to be able to plan with any certainty, it will be enormously reassuring to many authors to know that this fund exists,” said the His Dark Materials author. “With the cancelled event there also disappears, of course, the author’s fee. This is the situation that many of us now face, and which the Authors’ Emergency Fund will do a great deal to mitigate.”The grants are open to all professional authors resident in the UK or British subjects, are likely to be up to £2,000, and are “designed to meet urgent need”.The dire situation comes as the book industry is shaken to its foundations by Covid-19. While Waterstones, the UK’s biggest bookshop chain, remains open, independent bookshops are closing their doors to protect staff but hand-delivering books to customers to stay afloat. Publishers are offering free ebooks and audiobooks, and Amazon is prioritising essential goods, raising fears among publishers that book sales will dramatically drop.Children’s author and illustrator James Mayhew, who writes the Ella Bella Ballerina books, said he has had 13 events cancelled this week alone, amounting to losses of around £6,000.“It suddenly seems like all of my many possible sources of income are about to evaporate. I rent and am self-employed. I am the breadwinner in my home,” he said. “Am I about to see a 31-year career come to a halt? Of course, I look at the bigger picture – what the virus has done to Italy. It breaks my heart. Health before wealth, always.”Haleh Agar’s debut novel, Out of Touch, is due out on 2 April, but all her speaking engagements and launches have been cancelled. “As someone who also suffers from an underlying heart condition, I’m feeling extremely anxious and find it difficult to concentrate and be productive at this time,” she said. “Although this is so disappointing, I’m hoping for a silver lining, that as we’re trapped in this strange new reality of distancing and isolation, that more people will read books by debut novelists who especially need a leg-up at the start of their writing careers.”Children’s poet Joshua Seigal, who is giving away books online, said his entire work schedule has been wiped out for the foreseeable future. “Schools have all cancelled my visits, which was by far my main source of income. Festivals have cancelled. I do not know how I am going to pay my bills,” he said. “This is an incredibly difficult, scary time. However, my job is based on sharing joy, and I am determined that I will keep doing this, in whatever form it takes.”Like Seigal, many authors are taking new and innovative approaches. Author Glenda Young has been left with boxes of books she had lined up to sell at events, so she’s teamed up with a local florist who is offering a book and a bouquet for Mother’s Day, and says they’re “flying off the shelves”.Bestselling children’s author Philip Ardagh said he was already “around £2,000 out of pocket and counting” with multiple events and a launch party for his new picture book Bunnies on the Bus cancelled. “I’ve been a published writer for around 30 years and have been working from home for about 25 of them, but it all feels very up in the air at the moment. I’m still writing away but have put up a Bunnies video on my YouTube channel, along with other silliness, which I’ll be adding to soon, to try to keep children entertained during their six months or so off school,” said Ardagh.The Society of Authors already distributes around £95,000 a year to authors in need, via grants of up to £1,500. Charities and corporations who also contributed to the emergency fund include the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society, the Royal Literary Fund, the TS Eliot Foundation in partnership with English PEN, and Amazon UK, which added an additional £235,000 to the fund. The society hopes to increase the pot through talks with further funding bodies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e5bd734efdc3215195366e43ed04f27d76b943/10_11_3482_2089/master/3482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45efd1f8f85110070a9fc5997ac347b2","title":"marks and spencer considers temporary store closures wetherspoons coronavirus","story":"M\u0026ampS warns of store closures and joins Primark in cancelling orders as Debenhams seeks time to pay billsThe coronavirus shutdown is laying waste to the high street, with Marks \u0026amp Spencer warning of store closures, as Primark told suppliers that it was cancelling orders and Debenhams sought extra time to settle its bills.On Friday, M\u0026ampS axed its idend to preserve cash because its clothing arm faced being “severely impacted” over the coming months as Britons were forced to stop shopping. The retailer also said it was preparing for the likelihood that some stores would have to close temporarily.The gloomy update came as it emerged that Debenhams chief executive, Stefaan Vansteenkiste, had written to the department store chain’s suppliers to inform them they would be getting their money a month later than expected.“Unfortunately, we have to ask you for extra support,” wrote Vansteenkiste. “We will be extending all supplier payment terms by 30 days – except in those cases where we are already on extended terms. This decision is crucial to make sure we can ultimately pay the outstanding payable balances we have with you.”Debenhams had already asked landlords for a five-month rent holiday as it faces “unprecedented pressures” because of the pandemic. The department store, which has closed 22 stores in recent months and is set to close 28 more next year, was struggling even before the virus hit.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.In a sign of the scale of the slump that retailers now expect, Primark has written to suppliers urging them to “seriously consider putting a halt on all current and future production and the purchasing of any materials in relation to any Primark orders”.“We have been left with no option but to place a hold on any new orders being placed,” Primark states. Orders already in train were also being reviewed, it said, adding: “It is likely that in most circumstances we will have little option but to terminate those orders pursuant to our contractual rights.”Earlier this week Primark’s parent company Associated British Foods said around a fifth of its selling space was already closed as stores shut in Italy, France, Spain and Austria. In the letter, Primark states: “We foresee that this pattern of store closures will continue over the coming days and weeks.”M\u0026ampS said it had served customers “without cease through two world wars” but the Covid-19 outbreak meant it anticipated the performance of its clothing and homewares departments – where sales were already falling – would worsen. It was seeing substantial declines in these departments and has redeployed many staff to support its food retail business amid a run on supermarkets by panicked shoppers.With demand for its spring and summer ranges expected to be weak, M\u0026ampS has ditched plans to order £100m-worth of goods so as to avoid being left with a glut of stock. As Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, put it this week: “People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home.”Unlike high street rivals such as Next and Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group – which on Friday issued a profit warning and announced plans to close five Jack Wills stores – M\u0026ampS is expected to be among a handful of “essential” retailers alongside supermarkets and pharmacists permitted to keep shops open throughout the crisis.M\u0026ampS said its food halls were busier than usual but its bias towards selling chilled and fresh food (which have a short shelf life) meant it had not experienced the same huge sales uplifts experienced by the major grocers.M\u0026ampS said scrapping the idend would save £130m as it warned profits for the year to the end of March could fall short of the £440m pencilled in by analysts. The government’s decision to suspend business rates would also save it about £180m.In further evidence of the tough outlook faced by retailers, Hotel Chocolat said the virus signalled the closure of some or all of its 125 UK stores. The Shore Capital analyst, Greg Lawless, said: “The UK retail sector is facing a storm of reduced footfall to the high street, particularly for the general retail sector. Nobody knows how long normal lives will have restrictions in place – so the impact on financial forecasts is unknown.”“Cash preservation is the new priority,” added Lawless. “Those companies that adapt quickly and do the right thing will survive but we are in uncharted territory.”In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d809286933021d10f12e80c1c370c38ba79096/0_45_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa67f56559ad85e7111cf5dff367cdc","title":"new uk taskforce to crack down on coronavirus profiteers","story":"CMA to act against traders raising prices on goods such as hand sanitiser and toilet rollThe competition watchdog is setting up a coronavirus taskforce to crack down on companies that cash in during the outbreak by bumping up prices or exploiting people’s fears with misleading claims about products.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had already contacted traders and online trading platforms about excessive pricing of hand sanitiser, sales of which have soared as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.Action will be taken against firms that breach consumer protection or competition laws if they do not respond to warnings. The taskforce will also advise government on emergency legislation if problems cannot be addressed through existing powers.Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said: “This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable. We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid-19 outbreak.“But if they do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible. We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers. We hope that such action will not be necessary but we will do whatever is required to stop a small minority of businesses that may seek to exploit the present situation.”On Friday, eBay said it was now heavily restricting the sale of all masks and hand sanitiser on its online trading site. The company revealed it had removed over 350,000 coronavirus-related items and suspended hundreds of ‘bad sellers’ accounts in an attempt to limit trading at unreasonably inflated prices – a practice known as price gouging.Only a shortlist of closely vetted eBay sellers will be permitted to continue trading hand sanitiser and protective face masks. Other products will be monitored and may be subject to similar measures.Rob Hattrell, the vice-president of eBay UK, said: “We are doing all we can to abolish this selfish behaviour that is having a wider impact across the retail landscape.”The CMA’s taskforce is being established after the watchdog said it was considering asking the government to regulate prices of hand sanitiser and other protective kit relating to the coronavirus. With an increasing number of products sold out or rationed in many stores, shoppers have turned to online retailers.The US company said it had removed “tens of thousands” of listings. Other websites, including Walmart and Etsy, have also struggled to limit profiteering by sellers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec845c4b44195a4179ebb7d56c8d87ba4889d4e/0_485_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30a9b68ed8dd319e404245ed241b224","title":"coronavirus anxiety nature","story":"Reconnecting with the natural world – however we can – is a wonderful medicine against anxiety and fearThe National Trust has announced that it is opening as many of its parklands and gardens as possible for free during the coronavirus outbreak. The South Downs National Park, Forestry England and others have reminded people that our forests and grasslands, woodlands and commons are open for business. With constrained options for leisure and restoration and heightened stress and anxiety levels, this is good news.If you were in any doubt that it was OK to go outside, while keeping at least two metres away from others, the chief medical officer Chris Whitty told the BBC on Wednesday: “Being outside in the park is a very good thing to do.”He would know. In the past decade, the scientific evidence that connection with nature has important therapeutic benefits for human mental health has mushroomed. Robust studies from disciplines across the world are demystifying what many intuitively know – that we often feel restored when we spend time in nature.For a number of years I’ve been researching this mechanism for my book, Losing Eden. I was astounded by the variety and range of the evidence. Time spent in nature is linked to lower stress, restored attention, a balanced nervous system, increased levels of cancer-fighting “natural killer cells”, the activation of neural pathways associated with calm, and decreased levels of anxiety and depression. Phytoncides (compounds emitted from trees and plants), relaxation, stress reduction and awe are known to enhance immune function.And there is an abundance of awe outside right now. The leaves are starting to erupt vivid lemon green. We are at the moment just before the natural world really lets rip.Birds are busy making their nests. The baby-skin softness of an unfurling chestnut bud breaks through Bumblebees potter sleepily. The blues and pinks of lungwort are as psychedelic as a Los Angeles sunset.In this new world of uncertainty, nature can be transportive. Get down on to the earth and you can find a new reality. Spring is legal, free LSD.It’s also a symbol of renewal and regeneration that we need at the moment. In February Afternoon, by the poet Edward Thomas, birds symbolise constancy, a reassuring sign that the globe is still working: “When one, like me, dreamed how  A thousand years might dust lie on his brow  Yet thus would birds do between hedge and shaw.” Nature is a common element in war poetry.Can spending time in nature help people deal with death and dying today? Over the past few years as I’ve talked to people about their psychological relationship with the Earth, I have been moved by the stories of people who have encountered desperate loss and grief and found a solace in the rest of nature.For those faced with the spectre of the death and suffering of loved ones (and, let’s be honest, that is the fear we are living with), the natural world, with its seasons and changes and weather, reminds us of the facts: death and disease are part of life on Earth, but life goes on. On a run around my local cemetery before dusk yesterday, the sky was glowing and the trees were still winter-stark. The birds were piping up, indifferent to the quieter streets and the panic. Rabbits hopped around the daffodils. Obscene, almost, the sublime-meets-Basingstoke, but also grounding.For the religious who are unable to meet for fellowship, or indeed for those who normally find spiritual solace in pubs, recovery meetings or therapy rooms, the natural world could provide a connection with the numinous that it has done for humans over centuries.What about the most vulnerable in our society, the disabled and chronically ill? National Parks have been doing important work improving access to open spaces for people with limited mobility. The South Downs, for instance, is creating new routes in an aim to become the most accessible park in Britain.And for those who can’t get outdoors at all? Studies have shown that just looking at a picture of the natural world can give stress reduction and wellbeing benefits. But those who looked through glass window at real nature saw a quicker decrease in heart rate than those who looked at a technological nature window. Pot plants, too, are no small thing. GPs in Manchester have even started to prescribe them. Much of nature is fractal – a self-repeating pattern of a shape that varies in scale, rather than repeats exactly. The leaves on a pancake plant (Pilea peperomioides), for instance, which start small and grow in size but repeat the same shape. Richard Taylor, professor of physics at the University of Oregon, found that these fractals provoked brain waves suggesting a relaxed state which could reduce stress levels.Thankfully, the dawn chorus has started across the country. At 4.30 this morning, on the busy urban street where I live, there was a magical wall of sound. Crack open a window if you’re sleepless in the early morning, or first thing.In the interwar years and second world war, bird song was early public sonic therapy. In 1924, the BBC recorded the cellist Beatrice Harrison playing in her garden accompanied by a nightingale. It became a cult hit, and the recording was repeated every spring until 1942. It represented something that we all “unconsciously crave and urgently need” as the BBC’s first director general, Lord Reith, wrote.Of course, the natural world isn’t there to make us feel better. It doesn’t exist for mankind. (Nor is it going to be the panacea for our loneliness, stress and worry.) Are there ways, then, that the relationship can be reciprocal, instead of a one-way street? Perhaps by making our gardens nature-led and more habitable for other species. Supporting initiatives that improve access to nature and bioersity. Ceremonies, rituals, gratitude. Could reconnecting with nature help us see our environment and origins with new eyes? Could we start to see the trees in our stockpiled loo roll?In Boccaccio’s Decameron, the 14th-century novellas about Florence during the Black Death, some people lived temperately, hoping it would protect their health, secluding themselves from society. Others got plastered round the clock: “seeing death imminent they became reckless with their lives”.But there was a third group who kept a middle course. They carried flowers or fragrant herbs, which they “frequently raised to their noses, deeming it an excellent thing thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes”. More than 600 years later, we would be wise to take a leaf out of their book, and seek joy in spring.• Lucy Jones is a journalist and the author of Losing Eden: Why Our Minds Need the Wild"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0c2fbc8867cc8fba6608cc45b921867efd33ae/0_37_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6882f00649b7349c02e1ff28a3d95860","title":"home schooling teachers child coronavirus","story":"While the world outside panicked over coronavirus, I was to be the calm, efficient teacher to my child. It didn’t last longI’ve totally got this, I think. I point out she is doing the letter S backwards, nicely ask her to try again, offer to show her how, tell her to stop being unreasonable, mutter “oh my god what is your problem I’m only trying to help you!” Now she’s screaming “stop confusing me!” Jesus Christ, there’s another month of this to go.Like salesmanship and writing, teaching is one of those things a lot of people sneakily think they could probably do if they had the time. When the New York school system shut down on Monday, I went into this new period of quarantine fully nursing this delusion. By the end of the home-schooling period maybe my kids wouldn’t necessarily be up to scratch with their curriculum. But after busting out my best Jean Brodie impression, I truly thought I’d have them reciting Wreck of the Deutschland, proffering age-inappropriate opinions about politics, and engaging with the world with a sense of wonder unaided by worksheets. This was going to be great.This confidence lasted until approximately lunchtime that first day. After the fight about the letter S, I tried to engage with the school’s online maths resources, died a small death at reading the word “module”, got bored after the third paragraph, wondered how teachers cope with the volume of information they have to process, then called snack time.Going into this period I already loved my girls’ teachers, but along with a lot of other parents in New York this week, trying to teach my own kids has filled me with an unparalleled sense of amazement. How on earth, in a single kindergarten year, had they got them reading and writing and counting and sitting quietly – and that’s in a class with 20 other kids? I have two and by midweek was exhausted and screaming.We make a decision, my children and I. We’re going to keep our expectations low. We’re not going to schedule this out. We will study when we feel like it and if someone wants to break off to give their Baby Alive doll her flu shot or do a drawing unrelated to the task at hand, that’s not annoying, it’s OK, really it’s OK, no I’m not angry, I just need to step away for a second to look out of the window.By the afternoon, I have put them on iPads so I can get some work done. For a moment the apartment is quiet and I let the delusion resurface that I’ve got this. It’s going to be fine. From their bedroom I hear one of the kids shout, “Oh my god he said the F-word,” and, falling out of my chair, I yell: “Give me that!” Tomorrow, tomorrow, we’ll nail it tomorrow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/770029bfcbf39f7ce4341a177bf658b439e4e75b/134_0_1496_898/master/1496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ba61d554c17d85d1e2098aafff13194","title":"trevor noah coronavirus late night tv","story":"Late-night hosts discussed a week of mass social distancing, the president’s clueless press conferences and young people insisting on partyingWe’re now a week into mass social distancing, and “every day we’re learning something new,” said Trevor Noah from his couch in New York. “One, coronavirus is a serious disease. Two, it’s not just dangerous for old people, and three, your relationship was not as secure as you thought.”And each day, Noah continued, Trump “reminds us why hiring him was America’s biggest mistake”.On Thursday, for example, Trump boasted that he both saw the crisis coming and didn’t know it would be serious. “I still don’t understand why Trump bothers stepping up to the microphone if he doesn’t know anything,” said Noah, advising the president to “just let the doctors and the scientists talk.“Trump should just stand in the back like a hype man,” especially because when he speaks, he spreads bad information, such as his claim on Thursday that a coronavirus treatment drug was in progress. The head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Dr Stephen Hahn FDA, immediately refuted him at the conference. “If I could cover my face with my hands, I would, because this is the most embarrassing thing ever,” said Noah. “The FDA commissioner openly called the president out for making this shit up. That’s so embarrassing! He said it and then the guy was like no, that’s not the truth. This would be like your mother commenting under your Facebook post like ‘Just to be clear, Jeremy is not drowning in pussy. He’s currently in the basement playing Fortnite.’”Finally, Noah addressed stories of young people not taking social distancing seriously, pointing to news footage of spring breakers in Florida ignoring health recommendations to party on the beach. “Here’s the thing young people need to understand: yes, coronavirus is most dangerous for old people,” said Noah. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous for young people too. It can still get our ass into intensive care. It’s just more dangerous for old people.“Think of it this way: I always talk about the New York Knicks being a bad NBA basketball team. But they’re bad relative to other NBA teams. But if you and your amateur-ass office team played against them, you’d be walking off the court,” said Noah, feigning tears.“So get your shit together, young people. Coronavirus ain’t no joke,” he concluded, urging viewers to donate, if possible, to nokidhungry.org or, for NYC specifically, City Harvest, “and help kids get a good meal while their schools are shut down”.“It seems possible we could be cooped up for quite some time,” said Jimmy Kimmel from his couch in Los Angeles. “The government is now saying this could last 18 months or longer. Which, I’m not sure how many rolls of toilet paper that is, but I know I don’t have them. Eighteen months of quarantine means we’re about to see a lot of our friends’ real hair color.“Listen, I just want to be out of this house before Blue Ivy graduates medical school,” Kimmel continued. At least one person is optimistic: “Our fearless misleader thinks the prognosis is good,” Kimmel said, noting Trump’s tweet on Thursday: “We are going to WIN, sooner rather than later!”“What does that even mean?” asked Kimmel. “What are we going to win? We can’t even find eggs – what are we winning?”Trump is also “really going all in with this ‘Chinese virus’ nonsense”, said Kimmel, pointing to a closeup shot of Trump’s press conference notes, in which he crossed out “corona” and wrote, in Sharpie, “Chinese”. The edit “means even his speechwriter was like, I’m not writing that. You want it, you change it yourself. Somebody needs to take his Sharpie away.”At this point in the coronavirus crisis, Kimmel had just one message for the president: “Just shut up already and let the doctors take over. Seriously, you Trumped the shark. Go away.”A day after delivering his monologue from his daughters’ playroom (with his adorable daughters in tow), Jimmy Fallon moved his makeshift Tonight Show to his front porch, with a tablet to provide on-demand laugh tracks. “I heard that Emergen-C – you know, the drink powder? – they’re telling people to not mix their product with booze to make quarantinis,” he said. “They were like, if you want a quarantini, that’s Nyquil, Dayquil and a splash of Tide Pod.“But here’s some good news: today is the first day of spring,” Fallon added with a “Yay!” sound effect from the tablet. “Now Americans get to play a fun game: allergies or coronavirus?”And finally, “the federal government has pushed back the tax deadline by 90 days – I think that’s a good idea because, trust me, once I run out of toilet paper, the next thing I’m grabbing is a stack of 1040s.”Besides iPhone-filmed monologues, social distancing has also provided plenty of opportunities for late-night hosts to call up their celebrity friends. On Wednesday, it was an impromptu performance from Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. Thursday, it was a call with actor Jennifer Garner to discuss her charity drive with Amy Adams to help feed children left without meals because of school closures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa2b11e61716da8ea6ce0e7d4342b14513879e16/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303336d69df35c56fa0e283c8373a54b","title":"some uk schools looking at unregulated exams to replace gcses and a levels","story":"Schools discuss possible use of alternatives such as international GCSEs which have so far not been cancelledSome schools in the UK are investigating the use of unregulated examinations to get around the government’s decision to cancel A-level and GCSEs exams this summer over coronavirus fears, the  has learned.A group of schools have been discussing the possible use of qualifications such as international GCSEs known as iGCSEs, or alternatives to A-levels known as Pre-U or international A-levels, which are offered by examination boards AQA and Cambridge Assessments and are almost exclusively used by independent schools.The move comes as the Department for Education said pupils would be awarded assessed grades for conventional GCSE and A-level courses by the end of July, using an algorithm to be developed by Ofqual, the exam regulator, with each pupils’ grades then ratified by their teachers and exam boards.The DfE said pupils unhappy with their assessed grades would have the option of appealing, and the opportunity to sit exams in the affected subjects after the start of the next academic year or in summer 2021.“I have asked exam boards to work closely with the teachers who know their pupils best to ensure their hard work and dedication is rewarded and fairly recognised,” Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said.But while A-levels and GCSEs have been cancelled, students say they have not been told that iGCSEs or similar unregulated qualifications have also been called off, leaving them in limbo.Both AQA and Cambridge Assessments have said they intend to continue with the international versions of the exams this summer, because of demand from overseas.After Williamson announced on Wednesday that domestic exams would be scrapped, AQA told schools taking iGCSEs: “We need to work through the practical implications of this situation for our colleagues in the UK, but would like to reassure our schools, teachers and students that we currently intend to proceed with our summer series of international GCSEs and A-levels as planned.”Cambridge Assessment plans to go ahead with its exams and is currently advising users: “For schools in England that take Cambridge International exams, we are working with the UK government to understand more about their intentions. We will provide more information to schools as soon as possible.”The international versions of GCSEs and A-levels have been controversial in recent years, with claims that private schools use them to bolster their results since the qualifications are not subject to Ofqual regulation and their grades are not limited by prior attainment like their domestic counterparts.The move comes as most state schools in the UK were frantically adapting to the government’s order to close to all but vulnerable children, those with special needs and those with parents who work in key sectors, while at the same time holding emotionally charged meetings with staff, parents and pupils for what is almost certainly the end of the school year.Headteachers said they were working as fast as possible to provide remote learning for most of their pupils staying at home, while also trying to figure out the number of children to be looked after at school next week, and if it was safe to host them, and administering efforts to get food to those eligible for free school meals.The government delayed defining key worker status until Friday morning, leaving headteachers with little time to get parents to supply details and arrange staff rotas, catering and – in some cases - transport before the end of the day.“This week has been an epic one, with schools told they have to be closed but open,” said Kat Pugh, headteacher of St Marylebone CE School in central London, who described how her school called each family of pupils with special needs or vulnerabilities to establish if they wanted their child to attend.Pugh said the school then emailed all parents with a questionnaire about key worker status, but on Friday afternoon said she still wasn’t sure how many pupils or staff would be in on Monday morning.“We’re expecting 40 to 50 students, but it may be 20 or it maybe 60,” said Pugh, who said she needed to balance the needs of the families with the dangers caused by students mingling and using public transport.Other school leaders were preparing to juggle staff and sites to provide the supervised care that the government has demanded.Martyn Oliver, chief executive of Outwood Grange academies trust in the north of England, said: “All our 33 schools are due to be open from Monday for those students coming in – children with an educational, health and care plan, children in need, those on the child protection register and looked-after children, while all of our schools have a vulnerable register. Then we will have children of those parents working in critical sectors.“We also have two children who attend private school and whose parents are doctors, so they have asked if they can come to school from Monday, which of course they can.”The pressure has been particularly acute for the leaders of pupil referral units (PRUs) and alternative provision, which educate a high number of vulnerable and special needs pupils outside of mainstream education, while special schools are also likely to have a high proportion of children eligible for care.Philip Potter, the headteacher of Oak Grove College special school said: “Teamwork from staff, families and the local authority is amazing, it is how we juggle numbers in a special school while operating with skeleton trained staff.”The headteacher of one primary school in Dorset said: “Staff are responding well, spirits are high and we are getting on. It is all very Dunkirk spirit!”Paul Tarn, the leader of the Delta academies trust that runs more than 40 schools across Yorkshire, said his organisation was grouping its schools into clusters to keep fewer open and support social distancing.“We are more likely to sustain our support through the length of the epidemic this way than if we try to run standalone schools,” Tarn said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/368e9ea63a02044a9399e65e7257bd188117838a/0_0_5211_3127/master/5211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48f137cd00d14956222302005c1283e8","title":"nature is taking back venice wildlife returns to tourist free city","story":"With the cruise ships gone and the souvenir stalls closed, the coronavirus lockdown has transformed La Serenissima’s waterwaysLook down into the waters of the Venice canals today and there is a surprising sight – not just a clear view of the sandy bed, but shoals of tiny fish, scuttling crabs and multicoloured plant-life.“The water is blue and clear,” said Gloria Beggiato, who owns the celebrated pole Hotel a few steps from St Mark’s square and has a view over the Venice lagoon. “It is calm like a pond, because there are no more waves caused by motorised boats transporting day-tripper tourists. And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.”Under Venice’s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus – all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden – the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight.La Serenissima’s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored.The clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Swans and cormorants have returned to e for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. “Someone has put up a sign saying, ‘Don’t tread on the duck eggs,’’” Beggiato said. “All totally unimaginable a while ago.”As the death toll from coronavirus in Italy outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls.But locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping – except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw protests against overtourism under the No Grande Navi (“No more cruise ships”) slogan.At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance.In a queue to buy fish, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.”“For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.”The apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor.Matteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time.“For goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,” he said. “If there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.”It is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed.It is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way.“We Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,” said Beggiato.“If you ask me today – sunny blue skies, clear canals – then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with.“I honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e035fbe504ff60bd39afc138ebf1c814850f7f/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1cc99f32adcd4af489aa6914824855 1010w","title":"in a spectacular fashion the escapist world of karl lagerfelds chanel in pictures","story":"From a rocket in flight to a life-sized recreation of a ski chalet, the late designer will go down in history as the creator of epic moments of visual fantasy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c6eb4f692491e881d7def96c1aa7eb062db84f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da61a672d6357acbb85ae2843867add4","title":"10 best high street tops in pictures","story":"There’s a top for everyone this season, from statement tie-dye tees to elegant polo shirts and big-sleeve blouses.

What does the film about the flour-bombing feminist protests at 1970’s Miss World get right, and wrong?Sally-Ann Fawcett, author, former beauty contestant and judgeFrom a historical point of view, the film Misbehaviour’s sequence of events was incredibly accurate: a women’s liberation group – including activists Sally (played by Keira Knightley) and Jo (Jessie Buckley) – set out to disrupt the 1970 Miss World contest at the Royal Albert Hall in London. They bought tickets and chose their moment to stand up, shake football rattles, shout, scream and throw flour bombs on to the stage. It was a pivotal moment. To do that during a live broadcast in front of millions of viewers – they really did make their mark. A lot of women took inspiration from that.I think things could have been stronger, though. I once met one of the protesters and she said one of them actually threw a rattle – and it only narrowly missed the head of Joan Collins, who was a judge. And they were really sorry they did that. In the film, it was more about the flour bombs, shouting and screaming. But I think it was trying to show all the angles in a very empathetic way.There were one or two small errors. For example, they referred to the contest as a pageant. Miss World wasn’t called a pageant until at least the 1990s. It was a “beauty contest”. And there is a storyline about the inclusion of South Africa’s first black contestant, Pearl Jansen, known as Miss Africa South, during the apartheid era. That was portrayed as the idea of Eric Morley, the owner of the contest, though it was actually the idea of his wife’s PA. It was shown as a triumph but it didn’t pan out that way: six years later, South Africa was not allowed to enter either a black or white contestant – although I realise nobody at the time would have known this.I met Morley and I think they got him pretty spot on. He had a flamboyance. There was a documentary from 1975 that showed him shouting and screaming at the contestants, as he does in the film. They got his wife Julia right insofar as she was trying to steer him in a more PC direction. Eventually, she got rid of the swimsuit section.They were spot-on with the host, the US entertainer Bob Hope, too. His wife says something like: “We know what happened last time you hosted it – you brought the winner home.” He had an affair with Miss World 1961. It wasn’t mentioned explicitly in the film but for those who know, it was cleverly done. In real life, Julia had to hang on to Hope’s arm after the attack because he wanted to dash off to the dressing room and not come back.There is a scene where a large group of male journalists and photographers run at the contestants. That sort of thing happened. Bookmakers would take bets and you would see the chief bookmaker going up to the contestants, looking them up and down and writing notes. It really was like a cattle market, as the feminist group says. Miss World was massive business in the 70s and 80s. Only recently has interest dropped.Morley later admitted that, even though the protest did shake them, they realised all the publicity actually kept Miss World alive. It continues but there’s no swimwear parade and it’s a lot more about the women’s personal achievements and charity work. Is it still a narrow definition of beauty? It is – but it’s about an overall persona. I don’t think pageants are as relevant today, not the way they were in the 60s and 70s, when they actually were a stepping stone for women.Sally-Ann Fawcett is the author of Misdemeanours: Beauty Queen ScandalsAnn Sidney, actor and Miss World 1964When I won Miss World we still had black and white TV. It was 1964 and I was a hairdresser, earning 30 shillings a week. Suddenly I was on a pedestal – and it was fragile. At that time, we went to modelling schools and all wanted to be debutantes. Beauty contests were a stepping stone for working-class kids, or so we believed. It was an amazing experience for me. I’ve travelled around the world five times. I had to do fashion shows – but I said: “I don’t want to be a model, can I at least compere?”I found the film was very entertaining and fair. It didn’t take sides, though I think they portrayed Eric Morley a bit cruelly, and Bob Hope. Eric was tough, it was his contest – after the war, we wanted to celebrate beauty again. But he was always very professional with me. He was portrayed as being very bossy and we all know that wouldn’t be acceptable today. Expectations were different for women: we weren’t used to standing up so much for ourselves.The camaraderie that exists between the girls really comes across in the film. In those days, lots of beauty contests were held up north, like in Blackpool. It was a way to make a considerable amount of money. One day, one girl would win the next, somebody else. As Miss World, whenever I toured anywhere, all those girls from the contest came out to visit me. Julia Morley said something about “furthering the cause of international friendship” and this was true.The feminist group rightly felt it objectified women. As a Miss World, you are a trophy, you are objectified, but you can have a lot worse things to deal with. I never felt uncomfortable. I’m 75 now but I was coming up to 20 when I won. I had a different mindset. We were much more naive and it might not be a choice that I would make now if I were the same age. Hopefully, women today have more choices. I think it’s wrong to choose one woman over another. In this day and age, it doesn’t fit well.I wasn’t aware of feminists making a noise about beauty contests when I competed. These days, beauty contest are looked down upon. But compared to how women are objectified today, they were mild.Carina Tyrrell, doctor, Miss UK 2014 and former Miss World contestantObviously, Miss World has changed but some things shown in the film still endure – the multicultural side of things, for example, and the fact that the girls develop friendships. Today, a lot of them keep in touch with one another. It’s quite a strong network. Some have even set up businesses together.Sally the activist’s experience at university also felt familiar. She is talked over by male peers. I went to Cambridge and was very lucky to be at an all-female college, where you didn’t have to compete with men. You were able to speak your mind.I didn’t realise that, back in 1970, Miss World was actually giving a platform to women of colour. It was won that year by Jennifer Hosten, Miss Grenada (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw). And the film touched on women not being able to open a bank account without their husband, not being able to get their own contraception, and equal pay. Some of these are things we’re still fighting for.There is a swimsuit scene where they’re looked up and down. We didn’t have that, although I did take part in an optional swimwear photoshoot when I was competing in Miss England. I didn’t find it objectifying. But had I been walking down a catwalk with my statistics being read out, then I possibly would have.Fifty years on, Miss World is now run by Julia Morley. There is a scene where Eric is talking about the women’s body features and Julia says: “They’re personalities as well.” When she meets with heads of state in the Commonwealth Club, she talks about a shift in direction. You can see that she is taking on this leadership role and wanting change – and today the competition is very focused on its charity Beauty with a Purpose, which supports women and children worldwide. It has raised more than $1bn.What happens now, which wasn’t part of the competition in 1970, is each participant presents a charitable project, often issues facing women in their countries – for example, sexual harassment in Latin America and female genital mutilation in sub-Saharan Africa. The projects thought to benefit most will get funding from the charity, while the girl who becomes Miss World becomes a charity ambassador and supports the projects of the other girls.Today, you never have to wait as a camera hovers over your bottom or any other part of your body. And you don’t have any measurements taken, as they do in the film. People don’t touch your body. It was shocking to see people checking for bra padding in the film. We do still get called by our country – Miss UK or whatever – but that didn’t particularly bother me.I’m really quite grateful that the Miss World competition enabled a platform for the start of the women’s liberation movement. I’m a feminist and the competition has completely changed. Now it’s a network of strong-minded, caring women who want to bring change to their communities.

The same concerns are everywhere.Even where TV money is the major income, revenue is going to collapse. Almost every club in the country pays players more than it should, in most cases, more than the club can really afford. Players will have to take a reality check and reduced pay cheques. The £5,000-a-week League One star has to accept his next contract could be half that, unless he can secure a move to the Championship. Instead of being offered £40,000 a year, players in League Two may have to take the national layman’s £25,000. The non-league player on £200 a game may be offered £100 next season. And so it goes.Last Friday morning, when the EFL announced they were suspending all football, I was pulling up at Stevenage FC’s academy base. Some youth team players yelped with joy at the prospect of a weekend off. But, with Stevenage bottom of League Two and already treading a financial tightrope, staff at the club realised how serious it was. Some immediately feared for their future, with contracts running out.At Stevenage and throughout the country, there are teenagers in the final months of their apprenticeship contracts who may never play another game for their club, among hundreds of young players whose professional football careers are over. Just like that. They just don’t know it yet.With the EFL called off, I ventured to Essex the following afternoon to watch the last throes of the National League: a relegation six-pointer between Braintree Town and St Albans City in National League South, the fifth tier. St Albans were streets ahead of the hosts from start to finish and should have won far more comfortably than the 1-0 scoreline, courtesy of an own goal.Braintree, who operate on one of the smallest budgets in the ision and their team did not look sturdy enough to survive. They had several teenage loan signings, and a handful of young players experiencing their first full season in men’s football. Among Braintree’s five past or present Stevenage academy lads was Zak Guerfi, plugging away in their overrun midfield. Two summers ago, the 21-year-old was deemed not good enough for League Two and he has had a series of extraordinary experiences since then.Having earned a two-year contract with Swedish club Boden BK, Guerfi won promotion there, got picked for Tunisia Under-21s, was then called up to the national team training camp and secured a big transfer to Tunisian top-flight club Monastir. That was the up curve.The down has been dramatic: after being injured in pre-season and then not paid for six months, Guerfi took Monastir to court and appealed to Fifa before finally being set free. He eventually signed for Braintree last month. Now, after playing his first three games since last summer, the coronavirus has brought his career to another shuddering halt.“I haven’t had a paycheck from football since last June,” said the effervescent Guerfi. “I didn’t get one payment from Tunisia in six months. I’m still owed a five-figure sum by Monastir. I had a €200,000 buyout clause when I only wanted to sign for Wealdstone! Then they didn’t sign my international clearance which stopped me playing for Hungerford.“I’ve been training every morning with a coach and living off my signing-on bonus from Tunisia, which luckily I banked. But like most Braintree players I’m non-contract so, if we don’t play, we won’t get paid. A lot of players are going to be jobless. Some live with their mums and dads, but most rely on their football money to pay the bills. A lot of the lads do coaching jobs in schools but, with schools closed, that is going to stop too. The captain has got a new baby – how is he going to cope? Where is the next cheque coming from?”Some British footballers are still playing. Due to most clubs attracting crowds of considerably less than 500, clubs in Sweden’s second and third tiers are continuing to prepare for the new season, scheduled to start on 6 April. Prolific former Rotherham United striker Adam Johnson and teenage ex-Blackpool goalkeeper Harvey Simson played this week for Boden behind closed doors up near the arctic circle.Dylan Switters and Aaran Ekumah – released last summer by Stevenage and Norwich, respectively – have had a couple of pre-season games for Gottne in Örnsköldsvik on the Gulf of Bothnia. And, a few hours south-west, Luke Hirst (once of Dagenham), Kain McGaughey (Wigan) and Raeece Ellington (Bradford City) are a fortnight into three-month deals at fifth-tier Mora IK. Defender Jordan Boon, 19, who played three times for Bolton’s first team earlier this season, arrived at Östersunds last Wednesday, got injured in his first training session and has returned home already.Yet again Category 1 academy giants Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City have reached the FA Youth Cup semi-finals, but that does not tell half the story. There were nine EFL clubs in the last-16. In the quarter-finals, Millwall – roared on by 1,000 fans – only went down 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, City scraped past another Category 2 academy in Burnley 1-0, and Blackburn thrashed a bewildered Arsenal 4-1 at Ewood Park.In the other tie, Category 2 newcomers Wigan did themselves proud in a 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford. Among the young Wigan heroes was left-back Luke Robinson, who has been rewarded with a two-and-a-half-year professional deal. “Luke has a huge amount of talent – with ambition to match – and if he maintains these qualities he has a very good chance of a successful career in the game,” said Wigan academy manager Gregor Rioch of the Scotland Under-19 international: “His reward of a professional contract is due to his dedication and commitment over the past four years. His progression has been a pleasure to witness.”There was a familiar face gliding head and shoulders above the rest – literally in some cases - during the last night of Premier League 2 games before the lockdown. Ruben Loftus-Cheek played 90 minutes for Chelsea in their 1-0 win over Leicester at Aldershot. The England midfielder was impeded for the late winning penalty, converted by Luke McCormick. Loftus-Cheek, a regular for Chelsea Under-23s five years ago, is recovering from a major achilles injury.Chelsea’s victory kept them three points clear at the top from Leicester, who won 3-1 at Southampton with Matty James in their midfield and George Hirst scoring again. At the same time, Maurizio Pochettino scored once and set up a goal for Troy Parrott as Spurs beat Wolves, 3-2. Playing the final four rounds of the season looks increasingly unlikely.Watford were boasting of something that is commonplace at many clubs now: the average age of their reserves in a 1-1 draw with Aldershot was under 18. Among them was 17-year-old local lad Tony Currie, who, according to the Voice of Watford in the programme “has only to increase his workrate off the ball and he will be surely knocking at the first team door very soon”.It’s arguable whether Currie ever did that, but his wonderful natural skill soon saw him whisked up the M1 by Sheffield United within months of his Hornets debut. He would play more than 300 games for the Blades, becoming a club legend for his mercurial ability and play-to-the-crowd charm. Along with earning 17 England caps, Currie also had entertaining spells with Leeds and QPR. Incidentally, the 1966-67 season started late because of the World Cup: by mid-March several third ision clubs still had 14 games to play, Swindon 15.Follow Gavin Willacy and Playing in the Shadows on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd90418700f6fa3052d7b4ddc8e836160d41d87d/208_365_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a889ab373b3d950bc7b6c1d2592b0a7b","title":"in need of leadership and guidance as we work from home","story":"Sign up now!

It was my turn recently, and he greeted me at the pub with a set of Virgin Atlantic pyjamas.Usually, I am a “sleep-in-my-boxer-shorts” type of guy, regardless of the time of year. I like to give my wife something to have nightmares about, plus, first thing in the morning I like to look in the mirror to keep track of how many letters of the words “Calvin Klein” are obscured by my stomach overhanging my boxers. I am currently on the n and the K, and hope to move to full words by the summer.Sleeping in your boxers is a pleasant enough experience. It means getting ready for bed does not require looking for anything, and in the winter there is that sadomasochistic moment where you have to warm up the sheets when you get in. You also place yourself at high risk of cold hands and feet touching your bare skin: many of my mornings have been ruined by an icy foot to the stomach, as one of the kids jumps in.As is the nature of comedians, I will often be in bed when parcels and post are delivered. This means a scramble to the door, a realisation that I am wearing only pants, a scramble to a wardrobe, before scrambling back to the door to leave the DHL driver wondering if that was my penis he could see below my dinner jacket.For these reasons, I decided I would try the pyjamas out. When bedtime arrived, I went upstairs with my wife. I told her that I was going to be wearing pyjamas she responded by saying it didn’t need an announcement.The first issue was finding the bloody things. I spent five or six minutes trying to remember what I had done with them, turning our bedroom upside down, while my wife calmly retrieved hers from under her pillow – because unlike me, she gets up and has a structured morning routine. I always get up half an hour after I should, and leave a trail of destruction in my wake as I try to get to work on time. I will often return home after work to remember that I was running too late to put my breakfast stuff in the dishwasher, and so smashed it on the floor to save time.I have to confess to finding the pyjamas unreasonably comfortable. There is something about putting on loose polyester garments that makes you feel ready for an enjoyable sleep. The visual, however, was slightly depressing. I’m not implying that me in my boxer shorts suggests there is still some magic in the bedroom, but both of us changing into our pyjamas felt a little bleak.Still, having enjoyed the new nightwear so much, I decided I needed to experiment further. I worried I had been so narrow-minded about night-time options that I had allowed myself to be pigeonholed – so I purchased myself a onesie.It arrived last week. It’s cosy, it’s comfortable, and I feel as if I’m really getting ready for bed when I put it on. In fact, it felt great until I had to get up for one of my now-compulsory seven pisses in the night. I get out of bed, and try to stay semi-asleep as I go. This was rendered impossible: the onesie seems to operate a level of security similar to the nuclear codes – I couldn’t get out of the bloody thing. I spent several minutes fumbling around, trying to free myself via the usual zips, before panicking that I would have to tell my family I had pissed my onesie, and tearing myself out of it.My experiment is now over. ​I have decided to go back to my tried-and-tested boxer shorts. I can only apologise to any delivery drivers in the Crawley area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caa903ec84f01f3e107220390884f0fbe1b5a72a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6f94b20ef0d46cfcebf16d7733d6a4b","title":"the secret of calm how to de stress if you have one minute five minutes or 14 days","story":" Anxiety is running high, and it can be difficult to find time alone to take a deep breath. Here is a guide to relaxing, however much time you have to spareWhile “stay well” has become the default sign off in the age of coronavirus, “it is really important to say ‘stay sane’, too”, says Lucy Atcheson, the psychologist and author of Anxiety Attacks. As situations change faster than we can process, and we try to muddle through, here are some anxiety-busting coping strategies, whether you have one minute to spare or a yawning, self-isolating fortnight.“Breathe yourself calm,” says the psychologist Linda Blair. “Inhale slowly through your nose, counting to three, hold your breath, and then breathe out for six counts.” Ten of those, she says, will reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and boost feelings of wellbeing. Atcheson recommends sitting or standing with your feet hip width apart and inhaling, holding and exhaling for four counts each, breathing through your nose, especially if you’re feeling panicky, because “you cannot hyperventilate if you’re breathing through your nose”.“Learn a new word and use it,” says Blair. “Look at the word of the day on the Merriam-Webster website.” This simple act of self-improvement, she says, will make you feel more in control and confident about your ability to cope, “with a sense of, ‘Yes, I am moving forward,’” even though it’s not consciously tied to the current health crisis. Equally, five minutes is plenty of time to try a mindfulness meditation.In fact starting small is best, says Karen Atkinson, the cofounder of MindfulnessUK and the chair of the British Association of Mindfulness-based Approaches. “It is like building your physical muscles you start with low weight and reps, and then you build up.” Go outside, she suggests, and try a practice called taking in the good, “which really helps your psychological, emotional wellbeing. It’s springtime, so if you notice a beautiful flower coming up, savour the moment, and let everything else drop away. Just be with the physical and emotional experience of looking at the flower, or a bird perhaps. It takes 20 seconds for a positive experience to be registered in your brain, so stopping and feeling the air on your skin, and using your senses to be present helps to calm down any anxiety.”“Write a letter to yourself about all the good things you’re doing and how well you’re doing,” says Atcheson. The way to frame it, she says, is: “I’m going to write this letter to my best friend, who happens to be me, and I need to cheer them up. That really challenges the critical voice in your head and a lot of anxiety comes from not having sufficient faith in our own abilities.” If letter-writing isn’t your thing, try a gratitude journal, as Blair describes: “Write down three things that you’re grateful for. You may think at the beginning: ‘I haven’t got anything.’ Oh, yes you do. Spend 10 minutes finding three things. It makes you feel safe.”Two words: power nap. “When we get anxious, we start thinking emotionally, and we don’t use our logic any more,” says Blair. “The best way to regain perspective, and put logic back in the driving seat is to take a little break away from everything.” Lie down on the floor, on your back. Bend your knees and drop your hands to your side. Set your clock for 20 minutes or ask someone to tell you when the time is up. Close your eyes, says Blair, “and start the breathing that you did at one minute. And that is all you do.” You do not have to fall asleep, “but what happens is the thoughts that are running through your head neutralise. They are there, but they don’t have power.” At the end of 20 minutes, roll slowly on to your side, sit up and then go back to whatever you were doing.To avert the risk of being overcome with worry, it is important to structure this time so life still has purpose, meaning and joy, says Atcheson. “It’s possible with books, box sets, online exercise, trying a new recipe, talking to people who we don’t normally have time to talk to.” Build in healthy routines, starting each day with deep breathing, then exercise, and ending the day similarly – “not with high-adrenaline exercise but yoga.”Martin D Clark, the editor of Om magazine, recommends Yoga with Adriene on YouTube, and many teachers and studios are temporarily moving their classes live online, from Emma Tilley in Gloucestershire to Yoga at the Mill in Chelmsford. And remember the importance of microlifts – “small, almost imperceptible lifts throughout the day”, says Atcheson. “You may usually get one from grabbing coffee in your favourite cafe. Do something that makes you feel good for a moment.”Numbing the brain with mindless social media scrolling, she says, can allow depression and despair to slip in. Blair advises getting a pot for your windowsill and planting some seeds. “Things such as mustard and cress are good,” she says, “because you’ll see things coming up in a couple of days. And at the end of 15 days, you can eat them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e1cb7c2e7ec0522835f2eb8a3e989d48ca40e80/0_175_2224_1334/master/2224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d05f6c4415da0ce49b824068834f318f","title":"duffy new music something beautiful","story":"Welsh star’s song Something Beautiful played on Radio 2 to ‘lift spirits during these troubling times’Duffy, the pop star who recently said she retreated from public life due to a kidnap and rape ordeal, has debuted her first new music since the announcement.The song, Something Beautiful, will not be officially released but was played on Jo Whiley’s BBC Radio 2 show on Thursday night. Duffy accompanied the song with a statement:You may have read the words I wrote a few weeks back. I feel freer. I wanted to follow it up with a spoken interview but it’s harder than I thought.

While his early blend of doleful R\u0026ampB and emotionally despondent lyrics seemed fresh on 2011’s trio of influential, Drake-approved mixtapes – House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence – by his disappointing major label debut, Kiss Land, in 2013 the conceit had worn thin.A rethink was in order. As with his 2015 commercial breakthrough, Beauty Behind the Madness – home to the lithe disco funk of Can’t Feel My Face, which offered a PG edit of the Weeknd’s lyrical tropes of unfulfilling sex and drug use – and its bloated follow-up Starboy, the new album After Hours attempts to blend the drip-fed, drug-addled mopes of yore with luminescent, Max Martin-assisted bangers your mum can sing along to.The agile After Hours might be his best attempt yet at fusing the two. Rather than sticking out like a sore thumb, the glorious 80s synthpop explosion of lead single Blinding Lights – No 1 in the UK for five of the last six weeks – blends in nicely with the album’s nostalgic palette of shape-shifting synth workouts, tactile minimalism and (on Too Late and Hardest to Love), splashes of drum’n’bass and UK garage. Just as those early mixtapes were buffeted by blog-friendly samples from the likes of Beach House and Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Phil Collins-esque ballad Scared to Live soars over a hilarious sample from Elton John’s Your Song, while new single In Your Eyes struts around a refreshingly uncool sax solo.Lyrically, he ventures into new territory too, albeit briefly. The album opens with a suite of songs that show a scintilla of remorse for failed relationships that never seemed to make it beyond the bedroom. On the widescreen expanse of the excellent Faith he croons, “thought I’d be a better man but I lied to me and you” in his best choirboy voice. The featherlight, Limahl-esque Save Your Tears, meanwhile, offers up a hint of self-reflection. Even when he’s apologising or looking for reconciliation, however, it’s always to serve him and him alone. “Where are you now when I need you most?” he mopes on the title track, while on slow-burn opener Alone Again you can imagine him padding mournfully around his apartment as he sighs: “I don’t know if I can be alone again.” Unfortunately, this being a Weeknd album, there are still moments of misogyny, specifically on the bloated Heartless, which seems like self-parody, and the risible, nearly six-minute epic Escape from LA, in which he details having very boring-sounding sex in a studio with women who have all had the “same work done on their face”. Not that he has a problem with that. “I don’t criticise,” he adds, leaving a pause to give himself a pat on the back.What connects After Hours so successfully to his early mixtapes is a sense of narrative cohesion, something the Weeknd seemed to value above all else when he started out. Here songs bleed into each other, with sonic references dotted throughout to neaten up threads that previously he would have left to unravel. By balancing the two sides of his musical personality – not to mention add some levity to that boring, bad-taste id – After Hours feels like the first Weeknd album in a while to offer up a clear, singular vision rather than something frustratingly abstract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0f039a1aa8ab7a8befd0b4b9bb65cf7579a99cf/0_60_4564_2739/master/4564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ce1f5bebffb66d7a2297bf5bff48044","title":"how coronavirus infected the global economy podcast","story":"’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the global economy was already in poor shape when the coronavirus crisis struck.

However, the coronavirus outbreak has led firms to demand immediate aid.Graham Vidler, the chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies, said: “Operators are under extreme pressure and facing impossible choices over which routes they have to cut and how many staff may have to go. We urgently need the government to help now to secure the future of the industry.”Firms collectively employ about 100,000 drivers and 120,000 support staff. More journeys are made by buses than trains, not least by key workers and the public to reach hospitals.The confederation said companies were ready to help the national response to the crisis in different ways, possibly using buses as mobile grocery stores for people self-isolating, or as mobile virus testing units.Meanwhile, train companies started to confirm which services would be pared back across Britain from Monday, with passengers urged to stop all non-essential travel.About half the timetable will be cut after ministers and rail operators across England, Scotland and Wales agreed to ensure core services and freight could keep running.Operators pledged to run enough trains for key workers and to allow the public to access medical appointments, as well as maintaining the flow of goods by rail. Franchised train operators have minimum service obligations and could have faced contractual penalties without government dispensation.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are taking decisive action to protect the public, which means reducing travel for the time being, whilst still ensuring key worker heroes can get to their jobs to keep this nation running.”Shapps suggested this week that more rail networks could be temporarily nationalised but the government would be “flexible” over contracts. Several franchises were in financial difficulty because of stalling passenger numbers even before the current crisis.Operators will publish next week’s schedules by Sunday lunchtime. Many, including Northern, have already been forced to cancel dozens of trains at short notice because of sickness and self-isolation. It expects to be running rail replacement buses as part of its revised timetable.Among the first to announce emergency timetables on Friday were London and south-east commuter franchises. South Western Railway will cut all services on some branches, last trains will depart earlier from London Waterloo, and major lines will have only half-hour or hourly services, particularly outside peak hours. Southeastern said it would attempt to keep all stations open for now and stretch schedules over as much of the day as possible. Govia Thameslink Railway said it would make a second batch of cuts in a week’s time, and has already slashed trains to Gatwick airport.Network Rail has said retailers in its stations will not have to pay rent for the first quarter.In the capital, a reduced London Underground service has come into effect with the closure of 40 stations and the axing of the night tube.National Express said it would be running only a limited number of its nationwide coach services from Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ee22fc5badea1f1c4ac1bed7a8a8de1f52b21a0/33_38_1185_711/master/1185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49aa6672bbf6d9dd7f07ff8eb62537c9","title":"uk coronavirus live confusion over key workers list as schools close","story":"All the day’s developments as UK death toll reaches 177 and government announces new clampdown alongside financial easingTorsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation think tank, has also found a couple of problems with the chancellor’s plan - including limited support for the self-employed or low paid workers.Resolution are broadly supportive of Sunak’s announcement, saying:The Chancellor’s hugely welcome and unprecedented pledge to pay 80 per cent of the wages of employees without work to do in struggling firms is a crucial step change in the government’s economic response to the current crisisThe big gaps that remain in support are for two million low earners that are not entitled to Statutory Sick Pay and for the self-employed seeing work dry up because of the crisis, beyond those benefitting from the abolition of the Minimum Income Floor in Universal Credit.He says the chancellor has moved in the right direction, but not “far enough or fast enough”.McDonnell is disappointed that the government hasn’t boosted statutory sick pay, or providing more help for carers. He’s also worried that the wage guarantee scheme won’t be up and running fast enough to save jobs:Speaking from Bute House this evening, Nicola Sturgeon has repeated the UK government’s call for restaurants, cafes, pubs, gyms and cinemas across Scotland to close, telling the public that staying at home “will save lives”.Sturgeon said that people working in the NHS and care services “will be tested like never before”, and also promised “unprecedented” support from the Scottish government for the economy,Speaking directly to particular groups, the first minister began with older people: We’re asking you to stay away from your grandkids, from the people you love. That’s hard, but it’s so you can stay around to see them grow up.To children: I know this is a strange time, you’re away from school and won’t be able to spend as much time with friends. The adults around you are probably feeling a bit anxious too. So help them, follow their advice, study and do your homework, but don’t forget to have fun, and wash your hands.Describing modern technology as a “lifeline”, she urged people to call, text and Skype loved ones and neighbours: At times of crisis we need each other more, but we are boing told to stay apart, but we can still communicate and offer comfort.Asking the public once again to follow health advice, she concluded: This crisis is reminding us just how fragile our world is but also reminding us what really matters, health, love, solidarity. With compassion and kindness and with the dedication and expertise of our NHS we can and we will get through this. Fire and rescue service personnel must receive priority testing and vaccination for coronavirus, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said after some brigades reported losing hundreds of staff to self-isolation.In a letter to ministers, the FBU has said that without testing, firefighters and control staff could be self-isolating unnecessarily, when they could be on hand to protect the public.The union also says that testing could help reduce the risk of frontline staff transmitting the infection to vulnerable members of the public.Fire and rescue services across the UK are operating with 11,500 fewer firefighters than in 2010, and, unless services are able to test their employees, they could face dangerous shortages.Business leaders and unions have both welcomed the government’s new economic emergency plan, as they brace for Britain to slump into a deep recession.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, believes the coronavirus job retention scheme could be the start of the “economic fightback”.“This is a landmark package of measures for business, people and jobs. The Chancellor’s offer of substantial payroll support, fast access to cash and tax deferral will support the livelihoods of millions. Firms and employees will respond with relief and determination.“It marks the start of the UK’s economic fightback - an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage. An important day for our country.” Dave Prentis, general secretary of the UNISON union, believes Rishi Sunak’s plan will protect jobs: “People concerned about their jobs and livelihoods will feel hugely reassured today that the chancellor has acted swiftly.The whole country is understandably anxious about the spread of the virus, being unable to see their loved ones or buy the food they need in the shops.“Now at least the fear of being laid off and having no income shouldn’t be one of them.“UNISON will continue to work with employers and businesses providing our public services to make sure the money gets to people as a matter of urgency.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady is also impressed, saying Sunak is showing “real leadership”:Following Boris Johnson’s press conference, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked all restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas in Scotland to close. Speaking in a televised address from Bute House in Edinburgh, she said the number of cases of Covid-19 are set to rise sharply. She said everyone must act now to slow the spread of the virus, adding that we must also reduce the number of people we meet and come into contact with.The Wetherspoon’s in Leytonstone, east London seemed to be filling up in the moments following the prime minister’s announcement, whereas the nearby Bird pub was not as busy as it normally would be on a Friday evening. The publicans were not shocked by the news pubs would be closed at the end of the night and felt it was “about time”.Andrew Rose, a study abroad administrator is returning to Sydney, Australia tomorrow. “Pubs are not as packed as they usually would be and they’re the only hubs we have. I’ve been practicing self isolation all week.“I think the uk has had adequate restrictions, people have been practicing social distancing. It’s the same in Australia.”“Closing pubs now is fine, they said people shouldn’t go but had no protections for them. The pub today only has about 20 people in it so people are practicing social distancing.”Caitlin Morgan and her colleague Nick Slotnick are both from Woodford, and work in a local college. “It’s sad but inevitable. It had to happen.”They went to the Red Lion pub on the high road closed earlier in the week.Brid Fitzgerald said: “I’m surprised they weren’t shut sooner. I needed a break because I’m working from home.”A group of three teachers who did not want to be named said they felt “expendable”.“If we’re gonna catch something it will be from the tube, which is packed, rather than from the pub.”The word ‘unprecedented’ can be bandied about too easily, but tonight’s package from Rishi Sunak absolutely deserves it.It’s an absolutely gigantic package of stimulus – and the unheard-of step of the UK government paying a large slice of the nation’s pay cheques, to hopefully prevent unemployment on a scale not seen since the great depression.Handily, the chancellor has tweeted the key points:Morrisons is to take on staff from Marie Curie and CLIC Sargent charity shops whose doors may need to close because of the coronavirus. Morrisons will take on up to 500 colleagues to help the elderly and vulnerable in stores across Great Britain. They will be working alongside Morrisons’ staff who currently work with local charities and community groups.  Their role will focus on: More than 375 mosques, community centres and prayer facilities across the UK remained closed for Friday prayers today after the Muslim Council of Britain called for the suspension of congregational activities earlier this week.They included some of the biggest mosques in Britain, including East London Mosque, which holds 7,000 worshippers, London Central Mosque which can accommodate more than 5,000 people, and Birmingham Central Mosque which regularly hosts over 2,500 people on Fridays. Harun Khan, Secretary General of the MCB, said: It’s reassuring so many mosques and prayer facilities have heeded this advice in trying their best to minimise the spread of the coronavirus.We all have an Islamic and public duty to protect one another from harm, and I hope the remaining mosques, Islamic centres and prayer facilities across the UK take this extraordinary step in these unprecedented times and suspend all congregational activities.The Arcadia Group - Sir Philip Green’s retail empire which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge is closing all its stores with immediate effect:The health and wellbeing of our employees, customers and communities remains our highest priority and we continue to closely follow the government guidelines.In line with many other retailers the Group has made the difficult decision to close until further notice all of our stores from 4PM this afternoon. All store staff remain employees during this time and will be paid their normal pay for March plus any outstanding overtime payments, after which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated.In the meantime we will be focusing on our digital and social platforms to keep our customers engaged during this challenging time.Pubs in Penge, south-east London, had already started filling up well before the prime minister’s announcement that they must close down.The high street, whose environs host six pubs, still had five open as Boris Johnson addressed the nation. There were surreal scenes as the big-screen televisions beamed Downing Street’s daily press conference that carried news of one of the most wide-ranging peacetime changes to British life while, directly underneath them, games of pool continued undisturbed.Shortly after the announcement, as the prime minister was still speaking, one customer headed out to call a friend: “Listen, you’d better hurry up and get here because all the pubs are shutting at 7pm. Hurry up,” he was heard to say.At another pub about 250 metres away, a sign on the door assured customers that, as a response to the Covid-19 alert, children would no longer be allowed in until further notice. The bar was full, friends were greeting each other with handshakes and horse racing continued to be shown on the televisions.At a Wetherspoon’s further up the road, customers had been told that they must sit apart and try to use the app when ordering, but it too stayed open. It too was still was doing a roaring trade.At the Fork ‘n’ Ale taproom in Weston-super-Mare, owner Dave Turner was letting customers finish their pints and meals.“The prime minister has said we’ve got to close as soon as is reasonable,” said Turner. “I think that means that we should let our customers finish their drinks and meals and when it gets quiet we’ll close.”The end of the week is celebrated with “Thank Cod it’s Fryday” - fish and chips and a pint for a tenner. “This has been the roughest week ever,” said Turner. “It would have been nice if we’d had the weekend to try and balance that out but it’s not going to happen.”Seven staff work at the pub and another six at its brewery. “I feel very sorry for all of them,” said Turner. “I’m hoping the help they say they’ll put in to assist with salaries will work properly.“It’s going to be very difficult but we have to do what is morally right for the country as a whole. We have to do what is best for everyone. We will be closing down tonight.”An update from the Department of Health and Social Care:As of 9am on 20 March, a total of 66,976 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus: 62,993 negative. 3,983 positive.  As of 1pm, 177 patients who tested positive for coronavirus have sadly died.Q: What support will the government provide for charities and voluntary groups, who will be facing extra strain from the economic crisis?Rishi Sunak says the government’s business rate relief schemes will help the charity sector, who are also covered by today’s unprecedented wage protection scheme.He also suggests the government could increased funding for voluntary community groups.The announcements made by the chancellor during the press conference have gone down well with Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress.She said the chancellor had shown “real leadership” and called the measures announced “a breakthrough”. We’re glad he’s listened to unions and taken vital steps to support working families. Employers can now be confident they’ll be able to pay their wage bills. They must urgently reassure staff that their jobs are safe.The communities secretary Robert Jenrick has said the new social distancing measures announced by the Prime Minister will be in place for 14 days then reviewed, and has also provided a definitive list of places that are to close. Boris Johnson said of people not practising social distancing:To people going against the scientific advice, you’re not only putting your own life and the lives of your family at risk, you’re endangering the community and you’re making it more difficult to protect the NHS and save lives.Q: How much will the government’s economic rescue plan cost, and how will you pay for it?Rishi Sunak says it is a “significant intervention”, but doesn’t put a sum on it (perhaps because he simply doesn’t know how long it will last).It will be financed through the usual government borrowing channels - which means the UK’s Debt Management Office will be issuing bonds (called ‘gilts’ in City jargon), to pay for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b7d54b658da1f15c8a163dce9363067bea6c55d/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa7c13bf67cb0193806410b39d731be4","title":"national spelling bee called off coronavirus","story":"The Scripps National Spelling Bee won’t be held as scheduled this year because of the coronavirus.Scripps announced the decision Friday morning, citing recommendations against large gatherings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the ongoing state of emergency in Maryland.The bee was scheduled to start on 24 May at its longtime venue, a convention center in Oxon Hill, Maryland, just outside Washington.Scripps said it would try to reschedule the bee for later this year, but it did not commit to a new date. It’s possible the bee, staged annually since 1925 except for a three-year hiatus during the second world war, won’t be held at all.“While the timing of the national finals is just outside the eight-week window recommended by the CDC, this is the safest and most responsible action,” Scripps said in a statement. “This was a difficult decision that unfortunately will disappoint students who have spent a great deal of time studying and preparing, along with their parents and teachers who have supported them. The focus now shifts to exploring all options to possibly reimagine a competition for later this year.”Before the virus, Scripps’ biggest concern for this year’s bee was finding new ways to challenge the best young spellers in the English language. Last year’s bee ended in an unprecedented eight-way tie after organizers ran out of words difficult enough to trip up the winners.Rishik Gandhasri, Erin Howard, Saketh Sundar, Shruthika Padhy, Sohum Sukhatankar, Abhijay Kodali, Christopher Serrao and Rojan Raja combined to spell the final 47 words correctly over five consecutive perfect rounds, an exhibition of orthographic precision unlike any witnessed before in the 94-year history of the competition. Top spellers in recent years have used personal coaches and word databases that take into account Scripps’ history and tendencies, removing much of the guesswork from the competition.The so-called ‘octo-champs’ emerged from a field of more than 11 million students, ranging in age from seven to 15 and hailing from all 50 US states, overseas territories and six other countries: the Bahamas, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Japan and South Korea.Rescheduling would potentially require adjustments to eligibility rules and qualifying. Some local and regional bees have been postponed because of the virus, preventing spellers from qualifying for nationals. And the bee has historically been open to students only through the eighth grade. A bee held this fall would presumably include ninth-graders.A rescheduled bee would also present logistical challenges because of the bee’s need for a host venue that can accommodate roughly 400 spellers and their families, along with staff and television infrastructure. The finals of the competition are broadcast on ESPN, with preliminary rounds on ESPN2, and that too could pose difficulties in the fall because of the sports network’s other commitments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d323e703006400e724a21337cac1b5f237ebed7c/0_26_2472_1483/master/2472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce75f6a13cdb6bea62a79206c001d669","title":"tom brady signs tampa bay bucs","story":"Six-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady has signed a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, saying he is embarking on a “new football journey”.The 42-year-old quarterback who spent the first 20 years of his career with the New England Patriots announced his decision Friday in an Instagram post and thanked the Bucs for the opportunity.“Excited, humble and hungry ... If there is one thing I have learned about football, it’s that nobody cares what you did last year or the year before that,” Brady wrote.The signing comes three days after Brady announced on social media that he would not return to New England, ending his historic run with the Patriots.He joins an offense that led the NFL in passing yards last season, featuring a pair of 1,000-yard receivers in Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, tight ends OJ Howard and Cameron Brate, and a young, developing running back in Ronald Jones.What the Bucs didn’t have in 2019, when they went 7-9 and missed the playoffs for the 12th straight season was a quarterback who protected the football.Brady, who turns 43 in August, will be counted on to change that.The three-time league MVP is coming off what generally is regarded as the worst non-injury season of his career, throwing for 4,057 yards and 24 touchdowns against eight interceptions in his final season with the Patriots.Still, New England won 12 games before a sputtering offense was held to 13 points in a first-round playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans.Jameis Winston, meanwhile, was a turnover machine with Tampa Bay, leading the league with 5,109 passing yards while also becoming the first “30-30” player in NFL history with 33 TD passes and 30 interceptions.Opponents returned a league-record seven interceptions for touchdowns last season. Winston also lost five fumbles, with opponents converting his combined 35 turnovers into 112 points.“It’s not a talent issue, it’s a performance issue ... turning the ball over,” Arians said after the season, summing up why the Bucs, who scored a franchise-best 458 points in 2019, were unable to end their long playoff drought.Elsewhere, a person familiar with the deal says the Atlanta Falcons have agreed to a one-year deal with three-time Pro Bowl running back Todd Gurley,The person told the Associated Press about the agreement on Friday on condition of anonymity because the deal will not be official until Gurley passes a physical. The league isn’t allowing players to report to new teams immediately for those physicals during the coronavirus pandemic.Gurley will be making a return to the state of Georgia. He was a standout at the University of Georgia, rushing for more than 3,000 yards in three seasons.The agreement with the 25-year-old Gurley comes less than a week after the Falcons released running back Devonta Freeman. Atlanta ranked only 30th in the NFL in rushing in 2019 and are hoping for a significant boost from Gurley.Gurley was released by the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday, minutes before $10.5m in his contract became fully guaranteed.Gurley has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in three of his five seasons with the Rams. He ran for 857 yards in 15 games with the Rams last season. His average of 3.8 yards per carry was the second-lowest of his career.Gurley, a 2015 first-round pick, signed a four-year, $60m contract with the Rams in June 2018, making him the league’s highest-paid running back at the time. The deal included $45m in guaranteed earning. Gurley was cut before even playing the first year of that extension.The agreement with Gurley is the second significant move of free agency for the Falcons. The team addressed another pressing need by agreeing to a $48m, three-year deal with outside linebacker Dante Fowler on Wednesday. Fowler is expected to boost the team’s pass rush, a chronic weak spot.Also on Friday, the Buffalo Bills announced acquiring receiver Stefon Diggs in a multi-draft-pick trade with the Minnesota Vikings. The trade was agreed to Monday, and announced by both teams Friday. The Vikings acquired four draft picks, including Buffalo’s first-round choice (22nd overall), giving them five of the top 105 picks in this year’s draft. Minnesota also acquired Buffalo’s fourth- and fifth-round picks this year, and a fourth-round selection in 2021. Buffalo also acquired the Vikings’ seventh-round pick as part of the deal to provide the Josh Allen-led offense a primary deep threat it has been previously missing. Diggs joins an established group of receivers rounded out by John Brown and Cole Beasley.The 26-year-old Diggs has topped 1,000 yards receiving each of his past two years. Last year, he had a career-best 1,130 yards receiving and ranked fourth in the NFL in averaging 17.9 yards per catch. He was also responsible for perhaps the most famous play in Vikings history: a last-gasp 61-yard touchdown reception as time expired to defeat the New Orleans Saints in a 2017 NFC isional playoff game.Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen welcomed the trade with a tweet that read: “Ya Digg?” Diggs responded by writing: “LETS GET IT.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be13c712f31a14d90365e8450f803087fed9e0c/0_74_4764_2858/master/4764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb58b1a53faf86aa98219a42a250a4e0","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"As the coronavirus causes venues to close their doors, an increase of live-streamed theatre is expected.

Choose yours wisely, says sleep expert Dr Rangan Chatterjee Do you wake up with an aching back? With pain in your neck? Or an acute need for high-strength coffee? How you feel the second your alarm goes off tells you legions about how well you slept. And the underlying cause of your sleep issues could be literally lying under you: your mattress is the foundation to a good night’s rest.“One of the big problems with sleep is that we underestimate the importance of getting eight quality hours,” says Dr Rangan Chatterjee, M\u0026ampS sleep ambassador and author of The Stress Solution. “Once you prioritise your sleep, it automatically improves.” Sleep is fundamental to how we feel in the day. If you look in the brain after a bad night’s sleep, says Chatterjee, “you see a collapse in memory, attention, cognitive function, decision-making capacity and the ability to learn new things.” And an increased likelihood of exploding when there’s an unexpected item in the bagging area at the supermarket, because a bad night’s sleep is synonymous with a bad mood.Admittedly, we all have a few big nights out and accidental midnight Netflix binges, but sometimes we’re unable to sleep well through the night at no fault of our own. And a common culprit? That old mattress you’ve been making do with. “When your mattress is so comfortable that you can’t wait to get into bed in the evening, you send a powerful message to your body and brain,” says Chatterjee. Think of finding the right mattress as an act of self-care, up there with going to yoga or cooking a healthy dinner.Waking up covered in sweat isn’t necessarily a symptom of nightmares. The answer is more practical than that, says Chatterjee: “Being physically hot at night will wake you up. Being cool is critical to good sleep, so keep your bedroom at a cool, well-ventilated 17C.” If keeping the window open isn’t an option, or you’re still overheating, treat yourself to a cooling mattress topper or a luxury mattress with thermoregulating properties.If you often wake up feeling stiff, a memory foam mattress can feel like a miracle. The material is also supportive if you’re tossing and turning, or you have joint problems. “For some people, memory foam can be absolutely life-changing,” says Chatterjee. “The material adapts to your weight and body shape, so it’s very personalised.” As your body sinks into the mattress, you may even feel your spine start to stretch out. It’s the restorative antidote to hunching over a desk during the day.So how do you know you’ve found the right mattress? Simple, says Chatterjee: “When you lie down and you don’t want to get up.” Sweet dreams.The natural option: Made using cashmere, silk, pashmina, lambswool and cotton, the Natural Plus 1500 Medium mattress (from £499) is a pocket spring mattress with an enhanced natural and supportive feel.The M\u0026ampS Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night’s sleep.

The secret to a good night lies in your evening routine, says  Alexandra Jones“We all have our own unique relationship with sleep, but two things are true for all of us: to sleep soundly we need to feel safe and settled in our environment,” says sleep therapist Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Fast Asleep, Wide Awake. The solution is multi-sensory. “Creating a pre-bedtime ritual, incorporating visual, physical or olfactory cues can be a good way to foster those feelings,” she says. “So my most important tip is to find a routine that helps you to drift off and to stick to it.”And it’s not just about the 20 minutes before bedtime. “From the moment you step through the door in the evening, start making the transition from the busyness of the day to a relaxed state that’s ready for sleep,” says Ramlakhan. “There are a few small tricks that can be incorporated into anyone’s evening, no matter how busy.”But where do you start? “Lighting is paramount,” says Ramlakhan. The hormone melatonin is responsible for making us fall asleep the pineal gland in our brain naturally starts to release more melatonin into the bloodstream at night. However, bright lights, especially screen light, can delay the production of melatonin by stimulating a nerve pathway connecting the retina in the eye to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. “Candles are a good option if you don’t want to delay the onset of melatonin release,” says Ramlakhan. She recommends two hours of low light, giving the brain plenty of time to start pumping the sleep hormone into the system. Opt for the Calm Candle, £7.50, which releases a gentle fragrance mix of clary sage, lavender and sweet orange – formulated to promote relaxation.In fact, lavender has long been used as a natural sedative as far back as the 14th century, Charles VI, king of France, is said to have demanded that lavender be stuffed into his pillows to help him sleep.“My own bedroom is scented with lavender,” says Ramlakhan. Over the past 10 years, several studies have found that, neurologically, the smell of lavender oil has anti-anxiety and analgesic properties. “The scientific benefits of aromatherapy interventions are still being understood, but incorporating them into our night-time routine can make us feel calm from the associations we have with the smell.” As well as lavender, Ramlakhan uses eucalyptus because, as she explains: “It was used in my childhood a lot – and that memory makes it a potent relaxant for me. Adding something with a strong aromatherapeutic smell into your night-time routine can act like a trigger, telling your brain that it’s time for sleep.”When you’re sleeping away from home, bring your bedtime routine with you to reduce the unsettling feeling. So, if lavender is part of your night-time ritual, says Ramlakhan, “the associated behaviour and smell is likely to help you relax and create feelings of safety.” Ren Pillow Spray, £19, is blended with essential oils, including lavender.Alternatively, switching your regular shower gel to something like L’Occitane Aromachologie Relaxing Shower Gel, £16.50, could work just as well. It has a blend of essential oils that infuse the steam with a relaxing scent. “And if you’ve got time for a bath in the evening, salts are a great way to relax tired muscles,” says Ramlakhan. As well as washing away tension, This Works Deep Sleep Bath Soak, £22, smells ine and will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated.The trick is not to leave showering or bathing too late. Like light, body temperature plays an important role in preparation for the night the process of rapid cooling after a hot shower is proven to aid sleep, but it takes about 90 minutes to reach peak drowsiness.

Here’s what she learned‘We can grow that grass. When I go on holiday in Spain, I’m like: ‘Ah, it’s brown.’ You come here, it’s green! That’s because of our ability to grow grass!” I have to admit, this wasn’t exactly the answer I was expecting when I asked Tom Pemberton what made him proud to be British.Pemberton is the only farmer I’ve ever met. And therefore the only vlogging farmer I’ve ever met. He runs a highly successful YouTube channel called Tom Pemberton Farm Life, which he started three years ago as a way to publicise his dad’s farm shop. His videos include Let’s Talk Grass and Poo, and We Need a Big Hammer. And his 145,000 subscribers lap it all up.I’ve been travelling around the UK for the past four months and quizzing young people including Pemberton about Britishness for my new podcast, United Zingdom. What makes them proud – or not – to be from here? How do they see their identity? And, most crucially: could I be British?When I was a teenager, I moved to London from Singapore – a freckle of a city on the lower elbow of the Malaysian peninsula. Now, 15 years later, I’m eligible for a British passport. But Singapore doesn’t let people claim dual nationality, so I’d have to give up one for the other.I’ve always hesitated to make the jump. I’m pretty comfortable claiming my identity as a Londoner – but British? What does that even mean in these post-Brexit times? I decided that I had to find out before I committed. I told friends that it was like scoping out a party invitation (and, before you ask, yes, I’m the kind of person who stalks the other attendees before I click “attending”).Truth be told, it’s more like marriage. A citizenship ceremony isn’t so different from a wedding – they both involve taking vows in front of a council official and your loved ones, and pledging yourself for ever more to a single person. Or, in this case, a country. So it made sense to, well, get to know my beau a little better.After months of traversing the UK, here’s what I’ve found: Britishness isn’t easily defined. Every time I thought I got a handle on it, I’d meet someone who upended it. I found myself both passionately disagreeing and agreeing with the things people told me. But what struck me most is the fact that British people have such little self-awareness, and I mean that in a purely observational way (no offence).The things that seem most self-evidently British to me – such as the strained, almost sweatily perverse, urge to remain polite at all times and the love of drinking pints – are never what occurs to anyone.There are the cliches, obviously. Harry Potter gets mentioned so does the Queen. But there have also been lovely moments of clarity. RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant Sum Ting Wong said that multiculturalism made her proud to be Brummie an insight that made me – an immigrant who has felt, at times, unwelcome in this country – feel much more at home.As the country slowly shuts its schools, offices and pubs in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, it’s easy to look at your neighbours with suspicion. Are they hoarding loo roll? Are they coughing a little too loudly through the walls? Did they nick the last bag of pasta from Aldi? Small-minded parochialism can be part of the British identity – after all, this is the country that invented the phrase “curtain-twitchers”. But my experience making United Zingdom is that it doesn’t have to be. I’ve sat on sofas in Cardiff, split fried halloumi sticks in Bradford and shared countless pots of tea up and down the country. People have let me into their lives, their living rooms and, yes, their farms.I haven’t made up my mind yet about the passport, but I think that kindness counts for something in a potential date. Don’t you?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356e21cf5d3368bf0701f02031c2bd96c4f409a8/163_535_1270_761/master/1270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fd6a203b1162e102e8d6f17684869f9","title":"tiger king joe exotic netflix series","story":"The directors of Tiger King thought they were making a film on big cat ownership in the US. Then their subject was charged with plotting a murderTiger King, a new Netflix docuseries resulting from a five-year odyssey that fully earns the term wild, started, perhaps surprisingly, in the reptile world. In 2014, Eric Goode, a film-maker and longtime conservationist, was looking into a notorious snake dealer in south Florida when a stranger mentioned, off-hand, “check out what I just bought”. There’s a collective “oh shit” when he slides open his van to reveal a snow leopard resting in a cage, in 100F heat. “It just blew my mind: what is a snow leopard doing in the back of this guy’s van?” Goode says early in episode one. “That set me on this journey to really understand what is going on with people keeping big cats in this country.”If only it stayed that simple. Over the next five years (and seven 45-minute episodes), Goode and co-director Rebecca Chaiklin followed the thread of private big cat ownership in the US – a disturbing if fascinating topic in and of itself – down a rabbit hole including, in no particular order: a murder-for-hire plot of a rival big cat owner, a theory that said owner fed her millionaire husband to tigers (there’s no evidence to support this, though the husband’s children from a previous marriage have aired the claim in local media), a guru-led harem based around an exotic animal park in Myrtle Beach, an accidental gun death and a federal sentence for animal abuse. That’s aside from the astounding fact that there are more privately owned tigers in the US (somewhere between 5,000 to 10,000) than in the wild (fewer than 4,000), kept as pets or in side-of-the-highway wildlife menageries.But all that comes later, as Goode and Chaiklin follow the descent of one of the most notorious tiger owners in the US: Joe Maldonado-Passage, professionally known as Joe Exotic, who ran a 16-acre private zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, with dozens of tigers, plus lions, bears and alligators. The film-makers first learned of Joe, an attention-loving eccentric with a bleached mullet, piercings and a penchant for leopard-print outfits, through Carole Baskin, operator of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Florida, and Joe’s philosophical opposite. She had “a hitlist of ‘bad guys’”, recalled Chaiklin via email. “And Joe was her No 1 bad guy” as a prominent breeder of tigers for “cub petting”, a cottage industry in which people pay for photos with baby tigers, which grow to be unmanageable after about 12 weeks and are then frequently discarded, mistreated or euthanized. “Carole was completely obsessed with Joe, which naturally made us quite curious about him,” said Chaiklin. They reached out, and soon were filming in Wynnewood, about an hour north of the Texas border.Joe loved the publicity (“Joe loved being on camera more than just about anything,” said Chaiklin), his husbands (of which there have been several, sometimes overlapping, throughout the series’s five-year timeline), and his YouTube and TV channels. But he hated Baskin, who he accused of feeding her husband to tigers in the late 1990s and who had successfully petitioned malls across the country from hosting his cub petting shows. “The feud between Carole and Joe and their obsession with each other was quite comedic at first – it had a very best in show feeling to it,” said Chaiklin. But there was no end to the escalation – as documented in the show’s early episodes, Joe frequently and crudely mocked Baskin in his broadcasts, threatening to set venomous snakes on her and even shooting a dummy of her in the head.And then, in September 2018, in the middle of the Tiger King project, he was arrested on charges of hiring two hitmen to kill Baskin. “This story is a film-maker’s dream in how it evolved narratively,” said Chaiklin. “However, when you spend a lot of time filming with people, you get to know them quite well. So on a human level it was quite difficult to process some of the unexpected twists it took.” Some of Joe’s commentary in the series is taped from jail phone calls in January 2020, he was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for the Baskin plot and various wildlife violations.Still, Joe Exotic’s fall from self-proclaimed Tiger King to prison is but one of several absurd threads in the series, in part because the world of big cat ownership in the US is isolated, unregulated and propagated by cults of personality. “All of these characters check out of mainstream life,” said Goode via email. “They have created their own inidual universes – little ‘utopias’ – along with their own set of rules, which ultimately was Joe’s greatest downfall.” For example, Goode and Chaiklin interview Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, a polygamous, guru-styled owner of Myrtle Beach Safari who has been accused by a former longtime employee of running a cult, and by Joe Exotic of euthanizing tiger cubs once they outgrow petting (he has denied these accusations his compound was raided by federal agents in December 2019) Jeff Lowe, a former Joe Exotic business partner and con artist who took over and dismantled the Wynnewood zoo and Tim Stark, a former Lowe partner and private zoo owner in southern Indiana who is also under investigation for animal cruelty. And that’s not even getting into the staff and associates of each.It’s easy to see how Goode and Chaiklin obtained too much material over five years on this story – there’s a miniseries on Antle’s compound alone – but the most gutting and dramatic thread remains the shadow trade of wild animals in the US. “I’ve been in this exotic animal world for a long time, and I wanted to expose the exploitation and the suffering of these cats,” said Goode. In typical American fashion, regulation of the ownership of big cats such as tigers and lions is scant and confusing, varying state by state or even county by county. States such as Oklahoma have almost no regulations. “In some places there are more regulations on keeping a pet dog than a pet tiger,” said Chaiklin.“It’s not dissimilar to guns – you can buy an AR-15 in Oklahoma and you can buy a tiger in Oklahoma easily,” said Goode of an unwillingness of state and federal governments to wade into private wildlife regulations. A federal bill to impose much stricter rules on private ownership of big cats, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, has not passed Congress.It’s clear, even after just an hour of Tiger King, that there’s an intoxicating allure to big cats – a force that draws visitors to lucrative private zoos, turns keepers into fanatics and beckons viewers deeper and deeper into what can seem like an alternate reality. In Tiger King, reality is stranger than fiction and the characters larger than life, their morality, and culpability in Joe Exotic’s fall, up to viewer discretion. “I hope as film- makers, we have told this story in such a way that the audience will arrive to their own conclusions,” said Goode, while “ultimately … recognizing that the real victims in this story are the cats”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90148d5e1e42b04b36a630a28a79a59a4c721ff/0_255_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b9a4a428beef2e85253aa54227fc453","title":"detroit automakers shut down plants workers return build ventilators coronavirus","story":"Plants close but United Auto Workers union says most workers likely to return amid shortage due to coronavirus pandemic Detroit automakers shut down their North American plants this week amid growing fears over coronavirus spreading among blue-collar employees working in tight quarters.Soon they could be back – building ventilators as a shortage presents the US with a potential health crisis.Relations between the Big Three – General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler – have been tense of late after GM workers walked out in their first strike in a decade.But most workers are probably open to returning to the line, said D’Andre Jackson, a United Auto Workers (UAW) committee representative at GM’s Flint Assembly Plant. He added that he would “go back if it would help the country”.“I think the majority of the UAW members wouldn’t mind doing what it takes to get America back running,” Jackson said. Though workers just demanded to leave the plant over coronavirus fears, Jackson said the cause has changed.“Instead of working for profit, you’re working to help save some lives, and I think a lot of people would join in on that,” he said. “It’s what they did during wartime, and that’s what they say we’re in now. I think that if it was on a voluntary basis they could get people to go back in.”Both automakers have confirmed that they are in discussions with the US government, which this week invoked the Defense Production Act, legislation that goes back to the second world war and grants the president broad powers to direct industrial production.“Right now, we are doing an internal study to evaluate this as an option, and we are looking at ways we could help during this crisis including potentially supporting production of medical equipment such as ventilators,” a GM spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, told the .However, a United Auto Workers spokesman, Brian Rothenberg, said the proposal had not been run by the union. Its leadership was busy working to shut down the plants and did not immediately have a comment, he added.It’s unclear how retooling the factories or sending workers back into them during a pandemic might work. The Trump administration economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told Fox News this week that an executive said she “might even ask them to do it on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons. That’s the kind of can-do spirit that we’re hearing and seeing”.Ford, which will suspend production following Thursday evening shifts through 30 March, said in a statement that it “stands ready to help the administration in any way we can, including the possibility of producing ventilators and other equipment”.“We have had preliminary discussions with the US governments and are looking into the feasibility. It’s vital that we all pull together to help the country weather this crisis and come out the other side stronger than ever,” it said.In the meantime some 150,000 UAW workers will be put on a temporary layoff. A GM spokesman, David Barnas, said employees “will be compensated”, though specifics were still being hammered out.“It’s the right thing to do, but they should’ve done it a couple days ago,” said a worker from Ford’s Dearborn Truck Plant who declined to provide his name.The UAW has been pushing for temporary closures for several days. Automakers initially resisted those calls, prompting threats of a walkout among an increasingly frustrated workforce. On Monday, UAW Local 600 filed a grievance at the Dearborn Truck Plant in which it demanded a two-week suspension and coronavirus testing for all employees.Any return to work will have to come with better safety protections for workers during the pandemic.The UAW president, Rory Gamble, said temporary closures were “the prudent thing to do”.“These companies will be put on notice that the UAW will use any and all measures to protect our brothers and sisters who are working in their facilities,” Gamble said. “And make no mistake, we have powerful allies who have stepped up to help us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110065117a9cf3f154b0dd976cd75aefbb779767/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44eaa9b2fc8f25348865dbee9401c30f","title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"Become part of our new video project documenting the impact of the outbreak across the UKFor 10 years, the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series has been about getting out into communities, giving voice to ordinary people, and trying to find a new way of covering politics and current affairs.

After a phone consultation with her GP she was diagnosed with a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics.She began self-isolation last Monday in Manchester, where she lives, but moved to her cottage in Wales on Sunday. “I’m one of the fortunate ones,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation for elderly people. The majority of us live productive lives and hope that society will take care of us when we are older, but we appear to have been abandoned by the health service and the government.“I’ve finished the course of antibiotics and now I just hope it goes. I’ve been putting Vicks on my chest and taking menthols. I’m quite determined.”O’Neill has been trying to support the people she works with from home. “We offer a lot of activities like horse riding, crafts, etc. Some of those won’t be possible now but we are trying to find ways to deliver other services using video.“I’ve been reading a lot and am nearly caught up with the programmes I’ve missed.

When they all try and call it’s the end of the day before I know it.”John, who works as a bicycle courier in Manchester, decided to self-isolate on Saturday after waking up with a cough, fever and shortness of breath. “I wanted to be cautious as my job involves visiting people who might be vulnerable to coronavirus.“I messaged the supply company and they disabled my account for seven days, so I’m unable to work,” said the 24-year-old. “This wouldn’t normally be a problem but they have funds available for people who have coronavirus, but they’re not available unless you get medically tested.”As people were not getting tested for the virus unless they had been admitted to hospital John feared some people in the gig economy may not have access to the funds they need. “It makes sense as it prevents fraud but it’s a very difficult time,” he said.John said he reduces social isolation by talking to people all day on platforms such as Discord, where gaming communities can chat and share their screens while playing. “Not talking to real people can be difficult because you struggle to validate whether your thoughts are valid,” he said. “Hearing people’s voices makes you feel human and it’s a good way of trying to maintain social connections without social contact.“I live alone and one problem is that I don’t tend to remember what day it is. We’re so used to doing things that define our time off work that being at home means not having that shared experience.“I’m anticipating going back to work soon though, as people need food delivered, and there could be someone who is reliant on me.”Rosie,* who works in an office in London, has been in self-isolation for over a week. “I filled in the 111 questionnaire online and it advised me to call my GP,” she said. “I could only get through to a receptionist who advised me to go to the pharmacy, which I didn’t think was a good idea because I had a sore throat and was coughing.“I’m lucky enough to get two weeks’ sick leave from my workplace and my colleagues are supportive and understanding,” said the 37-year-old who is at home with her husband, who works in finance in IT. “My husband’s employer has been pushing for me to get tested but I can’t.”Rosie has been too unwell to do anything but rest at home. “I don’t need to think about how to pass the time as I’m actually sick. I feel tired and weak so I don’t want to do anything. Passing the time is not a big problem.”Andrew Moscrop, 42, works as a GP in Oxford, and has been in self-isolation since Friday after his temperature rose to 38.6C. “My fever resolved over the weekend,” he said. “Any other time I would go back to work as normal, but I can’t.”Moscrop contacted 111, Public Health England, the local health protection agency and the John Radcliffe hospital in the hope of being tested. “The advice was the same. Stay at home. It’s quite frustrating as at the end of the day you just want to do your job.“We are facing an escalating caseload and the government has talked of drafting in retired clinicians. Surely we should be testing frontline health workers so that, if negative, they can return to work promptly after an illness?”Moscrop’s partner, who also works in the health service, has also had to self-isolate along with their young child. “It’s become a bigger issue than we thought,” he said. “The government’s advice doesn’t seem entirely thought through as there’s nothing to say this won’t happen again later down the line.“We need to remain fairly pragmatic about it. We’re surrounded by fields so I took the little one out for a walk and a breath of fresh air. Soon I’ll have to pop out for food. I won’t wear a mask but I’ll just nip in as quickly as possible and use self-checkouts. My partner looked at getting food delivered but the available dates were quite far into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47cae858e7397f8ed4bf6e2c4da00f46102ac994/0_62_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946102312972887f99b4ed44c1715b4e","title":"behave or face strict coronavirus lockdown germans told","story":"German citizens could be confined to their homes from Monday if people do not act responsiblyItaly and Spain have both reported their biggest single-day death tolls from the coronavirus as Germany’s 83 million citizens were warned they would be confined to their homes on Monday if they fail to behave responsibly this weekend.As Europe’s governments ramp up already draconian restrictions to curb the coronavirus, authorities in Rome on Friday announced 5,986 new cases and a record 627 new deaths, raising the totals to 47,021 infections and 4,032 fatalities.In Spain, the death toll rose to 1,002, a highest-ever increase of 235 in 24 hours. The latest statistics showed 19,980 confirmed cases across the country, more than a third in Madrid. Army specialists are to help disinfect care homes after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region.The army, already deployed in northern Italy to help move bodies as funeral services are overwhelmed, will also be used to help police the lockdown in Lombardy, regional president Attilio Fontana said. “The request to use the army is accepted and 114 soldiers will be on the ground,” Fontana said. “It is not enough, but it’s positive.”Helge Braun, Angela Merkel’s chief of staff, warned that a near-total lockdown – as in force in Italy, Spain and France – could soon be necessary in Germany. “We will look at the behaviour of the people this weekend,” Braun told Spiegel magazine.“Saturday is a decisive day, and we will keep a close eye on that.” The chancellor would hold a conference call with state premiers on Sunday, he said.The epidemic has infected more than 255,000 people worldwide and killed more than 10,400, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Italy on Thursday overtook China as the centre of the biggest outbreak, with authorities in Beijing on Friday reporting no new cases of domestic transmission for the second day running.Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said the virus appears to be less deadly for younger people but warned that data from Italy indicated the fatality rate is twice as high for men across all age groups. “No one is immune,” she said. “We know it’s highly contagious to everyone.” Mexico and the US announced plans to sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as part of efforts to control the outbreak.As Spanish health authorities warned the peak of the crisis was still a few days away, frontline care workers described beleaguered hospitals operating near capacity and struggling with severe shortages of protective gear such as masks and gloves.“The current situation in hospitals in Madrid is critical,” said Ángela Hernández of the Association of Doctors and Professionals in Madrid. “The healthcare system is in a state of alarm.” Spain’s health minister has promised reinforcements, including medical students and recently retired physicians.In the UK all cafes, pubs, restaurants, gyms and other similar venues were ordered to close from Friday evening for the foreseeable future, and the government followed some other European countries in saying that it would pay a large proportion of workers’ wages.Belgium, which entered lockdown on Wednesday, on Friday reported its biggest daily rise in number of deaths since the beginning of the epidemic. Sixteen more people had died from the virus, the health ministry said, bringing the total to 37, with more than 2,000 cases.As in many European countries, schools, kindergartens, bars, nightclubs and non-essential shops have been closed in most parts of Germany and people urged to avoid unnecessary social contact in a bid to avoid a full-scale lockdown.But people are still socialising outside, some even organising “corona parties”. The leaders of Germany’s states warned mandatory confinement would be next. “Unless everyone fundamentally changes their behaviour, we won’t avoid tougher measures and sanctions,” said the Baden-Württemberg premier, Winfried Kretschmann.The country’s largest state, Bavaria, led the way on Friday, instituting a lockdown from midnight. “We are not locking Bavarians in but we are winding down public life almost completely,” the state premier, Markus Söder, said.Beyond Europe, more than 1.2 million Iranians ignored pleas by the government, clerics and local authorities to stay at home, taking to the country’s roads at the start of Iranian new year. Iran on Friday reported 149 new deaths, making a total of 1,433 and 19,644 confirmed cases in all. South Africa said its confirmed cases had risen to 202, the most in the sub-Saharan region, while Tunisia announced a lockdown.In the US, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered all workers in non-essential businesses to stay home and banned gatherings statewide, while California’s population of 40 million experienced their first day under lockdown.President Trump said US authorities were aiming to fast-track the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – synthetic forms of quinine, used to treat malaria for centuries – for use as a coronavirus treatment.Both Italy and France have said this week that they will extend their restrictions and may tighten them further as the number of deaths on the continent continues to rise.In Austria, which has reported more than 2,200 coronavirus cases and six deaths, the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said on Friday that the signs were encouraging, but the country must continue to “stick with the measures” it had taken earlier. “Hold tight,” Kurz said. “We must not slow down.”France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said the country was only at the beginning of the crisis. “We are right at the start,” Macron said. “We have taken exceptional measures to absorb this first wave, but we’ve started a race against the virus. We must react strongly, and reorganise ourselves continually. We need to anticipate.”On Friday, authorities reminded people that exercise should be confined to 20-30 minutes in close proximity to home and alone, adding that they should only leave home once a day, choosing between, for example, shopping and exercise.Police would step up security checks in Paris train stations from Friday, a spokesman said, as the country further escalated its lockdown measures. Like anyone else in France stopped by police without documentation to justify their presence outside their homes, rail passengers will face a fine of €135 (£123). The mayor of Nice imposed a curfew starting from 8pm local time, going a step further than the national lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0449e0fddd1890b9f2932b06557fb2344f6e6195/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17c4a21925237ef3f533cc35b1c8edb5","title":"chinese life slowly gets back to normal as the epidemic subsides coronavirus","story":"Restrictions are being eased across China as the number of new infections recorded drops sharplyAt 44KW, a nightclub in Shanghai, life almost feels normal again. Bartenders mix cocktails for patrons leaning against the bar. Groups sit close together without face masks on, talking and sipping their drinks. A young woman pulls down her mask and speaks into her phone as she livestreams to her followers. A DJ plays disco under a neon sign saying “Dance me to the end of love” while a few venture out to the dance floor.“Right now we need music,” said Kaijie Huang, 27, who manages the club, which reopened its doors last Thursday after more than a month of staying shuttered as Shanghai joined cities across China in various levels of lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak. “A lot of people seem very lonely because they all had to stay at home,” she said.For many in China, life is slowly returning to normal, giving other countries a glimpse of what might await them once the worst of the epidemic has passed.Elsewhere in Shanghai, women walk arm in arm past a reopened shopping district. Narrow pavements are crowded as residents browse food shops. At one entrance to a hospital, a man wore his hazmat suit partly unzipped as he waved in cars.In Beijing, traffic has begun to return and more residents can be seen out on the streets, in parks and in shopping and restaurant districts. Jia Shu’na, 20, travelled to Beijing on Wednesday, a stop along her route back home to Inner Mongolia to resume classes.“Now I feel like things are gradually recovering. Now a lot of transportation has opened up,” she said, sitting in a park with her luggage. Jia said she noticed long lines at the train station when she departed from the southern province of Yunnan, and several people in each train car. “Many people have gone out. It’s much better than before,” she said.More than 80,000 people have been infected by the virus that first appeared in the city of Wuhan, killing more than 3,000, but the daily number of new infections has dropped dramatically.For several days in a row, China has reported no new locally transmitted infections. Authorities are loosening restrictions and trying to crank back up the stalled economy, urging factories and businesses to resume operation.Some experts doubt the numbers officials have been reporting, noting inconsistencies in reports of what areas are deemed “low risk”. Others worry cases could spread again once normal life has resumed.“It is likely that cases will rise once China eases its control measures. This means they will have to maintain vigilance for a surge of new cases and decide how to respond,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US.On Wednesday, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, ordered officials at all levels of the government and Communist party to move with “urgency” in restoring economic and social order. In low-risk areas, production and normal life “must be fully restored,” he said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.On Thursday, Wuhan reported no new infections for the first time. Local authorities in the surrounding Hubei province, outside Wuhan, loosened travel restrictions, allowing residents deemed healthy to begin moving around. Companies are able to arrange for their workers to come back to Wuhan and most car checkpoints have been removed.Hospitals have resumed normal operations, opening to patients with conditions that are not virus-related. On Friday morning, the city of Honghu, south of Wuhan, officially ended its lockdown.For those in Wuhan, however, life has not yet returned to normal. Residents are still barred from going outside of their residential compounds. The streets remain mostly empty. Food supplies are still difficult to source and the prices are three to four times higher than normal, according to Iris Yao, 40, who has been at home with her parents for most of the last two months. She is still rationing their supplies, making one cabbage last a week and pooling with others in order to buy groceries at cheaper bulk prices.While Yao says the situation has improved dramatically, she disagrees with the characterisation from Chinese officials and state media that the government’s methods have been a success.“In terms of controlling the epidemic and requiring everyone to stay at home, that worked,” she said. “But the beginning was a failure. The virus was able to spread because of what was not done. The sacrifices Wuhanese people have had to make are huge.”The outbreak prompted a level of public anger and criticism directed at the ruling party not seen in decades. But as the epidemic lessens within China and the crisis worsens in other countries, relief has begun to displace outrage and anxiety.“At the beginning, I wanted to yell at the local government. Everyone was getting sick and unable to get help,” Yao said. That anger turned to a sense of dissent, Yao said, after the death of a doctor who tried to warn colleagues about the virus.“Now I feel like my emotions are going back to normal some. There is a little more light,” she said. “Now we are not in a state of fear.”There are many ways that life has not returned to normal. Economists say the Chinese economy will take a large hit, which could pose an even larger threat to social stability in the wake of the outbreak. Analysts believe the economy is on track to experience its first quarterly contraction since 1989.Day-to-day life for people across China will remain stilted for some time. Office buildings, shopping malls and other public places still require people to be registered and their temperatures recorded. Several areas require people to show a “green” reading though a smartphone app called Health Code, through WeChat or Alipay.At Tianzifang, a recently reopened shopping district and tourist site in Shanghai’s French Concession, the measures have created a bottleneck. A small crowd is gathered at the entrance where two guards try to guide confused patrons through the Health Code app, as well as an additional ticket to enter.For others, the added measures are perfunctory. At the gate to one neighbourhood of Shanghai’s iconic lane houses, a guard sat next to a folding table with a clipboard to register those coming in and out. Residents quickly stuck their arms out for their temperature to be taken. One walked away before his reading came up while others noted with surprise changes in their temperature.“The last place said I was 33 degrees. How can I now be 36?” one asked, complaining about inaccurate thermometers being used in the city.While China has reported no new locally transmitted cases, the country has still seen daily increases in those coming from abroad, prompting worries of a rebound. Imported cases reached 228 as of Friday, as infected travellers were confirmed not only at major hubs like Beijing and Shanghai but in provinces including Liaoning, Gansu, Heilongjiang in the north and Zhejiang, Fujian, and Sichuan in the south and west.“The number of imported cases in China has further increased. So the pressure to be on guard has also increased,” said Wang Bin, an official of the national health commission at a news conference on Friday.Xi has ordered officials to be vigilant at the borders, and international flights to Beijing have been erted to other cities. Wariness of foreigners has increased. As one US citizen struggled to check into a hotel in Shanghai, a woman waiting in line murmured: “Before, everyone was afraid of Chinese people. Now it’s the reverse.”At 44KW, patrons must show their Health Code reading and foreigners have to bring their passports to show they have not been in virus-stricken areas recently. For now, the club cannot host DJs coming from overseas. Yuan Qingai, 26, a singer, is livestreaming from the club and speaking to more than 100 fans online.She tells them that she is speaking to foreign media about the epidemic. They quickly advise: “You should wear a mask.”Additional reporting by Dave Tacon and Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus at a glance latest news","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Italy and Spain both reported their biggest single-day death tolls from the coronavirus. Authorities in Rome on Friday announced 5,986 new cases and a record 627 new deaths, raising the totals to 47,021 infections and 4,032 fatalities. In Spain, the death toll rose to 1,002, a highest-ever increase of 235 in 24 hours. Helge Braun, Angela Merkel’s chief of staff, warned that a near-total lockdown – as in force in Italy, Spain and France – could soon be necessary in Germany.The US president has invoked the Defense Production Act to get needed medical supplies on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak, mobilising the federal government to marshal the private sector to combat the pandemic. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has confirmed the US-Mexican border will be closing to non-essential travel.The epidemic has infected more than 255,000 people worldwide and killed more than 10,400, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Around half of those deaths have been in Europe, according to an AFP tally based on official sources.The Chinese doctor who was reprimanded for “spreading rumours” after he sought to warn colleagues about the emergence of Covid-19 has been officially exonerated by an investigation into his death. However the report has also been criticised for not going far enough, after it only recommended the reprimand against Dr Li Wenliang be withdrawn.Thousands of British holidaymakers could find themselves stranded abroad, as flight cancellations, travel restrictions and lockdowns due to the global coronavirus pandemic complicate their journeys home. As many as 100,000 tourists may still be in Spain, despite a near-total lockdown and government orders that all hotels be shut down within the week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4abc4c919ef5efa5943a2fd81183ee9167217ae2/0_1351_2186_1312/master/2186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30051bd13432c023f4618d9e1c9244ae","title":"coronavirus impossible mother tirade remote schooling","story":"Israeli tells her children’s teachers, ‘Enough – it’s not working’ in an Instagram videoParents of school-aged children who are frustrated with being forced by coronavirus to supervise their education for potentially months on end have found their champion in a very cross Israeli mother.She rails on Instagram that, “It’s not working this distance learning thing. Seriously, it’s impossible, it’s crazy!”“You’ve finished us off - it’s only the second day! If we don’t die of corona, we’ll die of distance learning!” she shouts into the camera in a 90-second rant posted on Instagram.“One of my daughter’s teachers is living in a dream world if he thinks she’ll get up at 8am to see him on screen. 8am she only just manages to roll over in bed. Where do you get off?” she says. The woman, who says she has four children, complains that schools are asking too much of parents who are running from “one child to the other – here’s science, here’s math – forget it! And how am I supposed to know all those things? Now our children will find out how dumb we are… How am I supposed to know how to transform an improper fraction?“The music teacher of my youngest sent over a musical score this morning. What am I going to do with that information? What, have I got some band in the house? I can’t read music. Just one second, let me pull out my clarinet and help my son with his score. Enough guys, teachers, dial it down with the expectations.”It raised the issue of the extra stress placed on parents – as well as on children – by schools around the world closing due to coronavirus. “The kid’s fine, he’s on his cellphone all day. I’m falling to pieces,” the mother in the video says.The closure of schools has been one of the most contentious measures introduced – or not – by governments in their efforts to fight the coronavirus. More than 70 countries have made the decision to shut down schools in the hope of reducing the spread of the virus.On Wednesday, Boris Johnson announced that schools across the UK were to close indefinitely and that A-level and GCSE exams would not take place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057ccb905652fc199bbe89ddd264a1f166cbd876/0_294_3494_2096/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85793ad49b365f9792c5a4e73f7830be","title":"coronavirus symptoms doctor covid 19 cough","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the symptoms as experiencing either:No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 20 March, more than 244,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 10,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has seen over 3,400 deaths. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 86,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

Life had already been upended in China. Iran and Italy have been reeling for a month. And yet it still felt sudden, this week, when walls were raised across the world, entire societies were quarantined and billions of people realised they had crossed a iding line: from life before coronavirus to after.After weeks of governments prevaricating over whether to ban mass gatherings, close businesses or seal borders, restrictions came in a flurry. “We are at war,” announced the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But without adequate weapons to fight the virus, let alone enough hospital beds or ventilators, this was the week the world beat a tactical retreat.Spain’s 46 million citizens were in lockdown by Sunday morning. Its death toll would double by the end of the day to 288. People had partied in Dublin’s Temple Bar on Saturday night. It was a last hurrah: the neighbourhood’s water holes were indefinitely closed the following day.The same day, Germany closed its borders to France, Switzerland and Austria, whose chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, warned the country the next weeks would be “challenging, difficult and painful”. More than 1,400 people had died in Italy.In Mafraq, a small city in Jordan, a Syrian girl, Reem Ahmed, missed school for the first time since September. Though aged 11, the past six months were the only time she had ever spent in a classroom, part of a humanitarian programme to steer refugee children out of work and into education. But classes across Jordan had been suspended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Reem spent the first Sunday at home crying, her father said. “I had friends at school and learned from my teachers there,” she said.On Monday, the worldwide death toll crossed 7,000. Canada closed its borders to all foreigners except for Americans. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump struck newly urgent tones, asking people to avoid going to bars or theatres, and to self-isolate for two weeks if they felt sick. “Now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel,” Johnson said.A research team at Imperial College released a report that is said to have contributed to the policy shifts. Without significant changes in people’s behaviour, it said, the British death toll could cross half a million, with 2.2 million dead in the US. Social distancing measures would need to continue until a vaccine was found, it added. That would be at least 18 months away.In the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, a jeans factory owner named Mostafiz Uddin received an email from a western buyer. Stop all shipments immediately, it said. “I got very upset,” Uddin said. “I had four trucks of goods which were on their way to being shipped. I brought them back to the factory. When the buyer says they can’t ship it, we can’t do anything. Everything is in their hands.”In Tabriz, a city in north-western Iran, a young medical researcher named Sara Amiri asked a colleague to test her for coronavirus. “I had had a headache for days and one of my colleagues, a doctor who used to visit patients, had tested positive for the virus,” she said.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.By Tuesday, Idris Elba had the virus. Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, were discharged from hospital. Australia put out an unprecedented call for its citizens to return home. Iran freed tens of thousands of prisoners including the British national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. More than 1,000 prisoners in Brazil escaped. West Virginia recorded its first case of the virus, meaning all 50 American states were infected. The Taj Mahal in India was indefinitely closed.In Melbourne, Australia, a retiree named Andrew Cameron went to the supermarket. He went early, during a specially designated shopping time reserved for older people and those with disabilities.“The shelves were bare, no toilet paper, no paper towels, pasta’s gone, a lot of frozen food was gone,” he said. “A lot of vegetarian food, interestingly. Even the hard tofu, can you imagine?”He took two bottles of hand sanitiser to the self-checkout, but encountered a problem. “The machine said no, you’re only allowed one,” he said.Neither the checkout attendant nor the store manager could overrule the machine. Cameron, 76, argued his case anyway, while his wife Ursula stood behind him, trying to make sure he maintained the recommended 1.5-metre distance from other people. “She was saying, step back Andy, step back.”Ursula has since banned him from the supermarket. “Which is sad for me, because I like to shop,” he said.On Wednesday evening, Angela Merkel told Germans they were facing their biggest crisis since the second world war and reunification. “The situation is serious,” she said. “Take it seriously.”Europe had already closed its external borders to most of the world. Italy announced its highest single-day death toll: 475. Parisians gathered on their balconies to applaud the efforts of medical staff. The first deaths were recorded in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burkina Faso. The World Health Organization warned Africa to “wake up” and expect the worst.Uddin, in Bangladesh, received another email. “Please cancel any new orders,” it said. It did not say for how long. Shift lengths at his factory are already being cut from 10 hours to eight. Four million people, mostly women, work in Bangladesh’s garment industry.“This uncertainty will kill us,” he said. “I will be able to pay my workers for the first month – I’ll arrange something. But the next month, and the one after? No, there is no solution.”In Iran, Amiri started working from home. “I’m fine, I just have asthma and a headache, and yesterday I couldn’t eat anything,” she said.She was more worried about shortages of masks and protective material at hospitals and pharmacies. “I’m not sure how much is the result of sanctions, and how much is weakness from our government,” she said.On Thursday, deaths in Italy crossed 3,400, exceeding China’s toll. Beijing said it had recorded no new cases among its population for the first time. Confirmed cases in Spain had more than doubled since the beginning of the week to at least 17,000.India’s Narendra Modi urged his country’s 1.3 billion citizens to observe a national curfew on Sunday, while the UN warned it was only a matter of time until the virus reached Idlib, where nearly 1 million refugees were living in makeshift accommodation and overcrowded tents.In Jordan, Reem spent the day watching the sports channel on television, which had been repurposed to broadcast school lessons. Her sister Malaka, 12, had never been to school she spent the day as usual, picking fruit at a nearby farm for about £5 a day. “We need the money to live off,” Fawaz, her father, said. “Life is hard otherwise.”If school did not resume soon, he added, Reem would have to join her. “If things don’t improve, she’ll have to go,” he said.In Las Vegas, Jedick worked on flow charts to help the hospital deal with a glut of patients. “We have a bit of a panic where anybody with respiratory symptoms or a fever is coming in and flooding the ER,” he said.His facility was planning to set up tents outside where incoming patients could be triaged and treated if necessary. “We’re looking at the numbers coming out of Italy and China and assuming we could see an exponential growth of this thing.”The results were in: the patient he had treated on Sunday had coronavirus. Jedick would be back in the ward at the weekend. “Healthcare workers are, for many reasons, at higher risk,” he said. “Someone has to get it. I could be that person. But my mind doesn’t work like that. I’m optimistic and I don’t think it’ll be me.”In Tabriz, Amiri received a phone call. “I was informed that I’m positive,” she said. “I don’t feel anything right now, I’m just worried about my family, even though I avoided them these last few days.”Her husband was isolating with her and keeping her spirits high, she said. “He tells me: ‘You are so strong, coronavirus is going to regret getting anywhere near you’.”Additional reporting by Akhtar Mohammad Makoii and Jassar Al-Tahat"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 across the United Kingdom.

The children, two girls and a boy from West Berlin, eventually managed to get their ball back, but not before the Stasi had thoroughly documented the ball’s position – “around 25 metres from the border markings” – and photographed the ceremonial return of the offending object.A lightbulb tossed out of a high-rise apartment caused a similar flurry of activity in the town of Suhl on 7 October 1987, after it hit the roof of a vehicle in a motorcade for state apparatchiks. The Stasi suspected “negative enemy forces” were to blame.Over the 40-year existence of communist East Germany, the Ministry of State Security built one of the most tightly controlled surveillance regimes in history. The Stasi created a vast web of full-time agents and part-time spies, with some historians calculating that there was one informant for every 6.5 citizens.The historian Philipp Springer, who spent two and a half years combing through the archive’s more than 2m photographs, said the Stasi’s attention to seemingly mundane detail intensified as technology became more sophisticated and easier to disguise.“In the 1950s, photography was still a relatively rare technology. But by the 80s cameras were more widely available and the Stasi discovered them as what they called a ‘weapon’. The number of photographs taken grew exponentially.”Cameras were hidden inside arm casts, shopping bags, books and bras, with the ministry offering incentives for employees who could come up with ingenious solutions.“East Germany’s secret police had a tendency to see the fingerprints of ‘the enemy’ behind every minor event or mishap, so they began to take pictures of even seemingly harmless everyday objects,” Springer said.Sometimes, the appetite for photographic documentation could backfire. In May 1980, Stasi spies accidentally took photographs of a senior member of their own team leaving and entering a house that had been put under surveillance in Neubrandenburg. It emerged the man had used the same building to maintain an extramarital affair with a colleague in the secret police.“When you e into the archive in a non-systematic way, you find all sorts of stories that surprise you,” said Springer. One cache of pictures documented the story of a 19-year-old Soviet soldier who spent four and a half years hiding in a hole in the ground in rural Brandenburg after deserting from his East German barracks. “If Hollywood had made a film about that, I wouldn’t have believed it.”Another series of photographs shows a young couple from Dresden with a six-month-old child, who had tried to escape to the west in the boot of a car. The baby suffocated during the journey, most likely because of leaked exhaust fumes, the couple were arrested before making it across the border. Unmoved, the Stasi continued to spy on the couple after the tragedy, even getting a photographer to covertly take pictures at their child’s funeral.“Many of these pictures are now comical in an involuntary way,” said Springer. “But when you come across a picture like this, it really drives home the incredible inhumanity of this surveillance state.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/830892952eacb6baccd897d516fe38d7e30243fb/0_197_2450_1470/master/2450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbbecf19797e21d93ddbfbe4704d9a3d","title":"iranian new year self isolate covid 19","story":" Holiday destinations report thousands of cars despite advice to self-isolate as Covid-19 spreadsPleas by the Iranian government for citizens to stay at home at the start of the country’s new year have been widely ignored, with more than 1.2 million people taking to the roads, according to police.Northern towns on the Caspian coast reported tens of thousands of cars trying to reach the main holiday destinations.Latest figures published on Friday showed Iran had recorded 19,644 cases of infection and 1,433 deaths. There were 1,237 new infections in the past 24 hours and 149 new deaths. The number of new infections is a record high for a single day, and the number of deaths is the same as the day before.Every layer of Iranian society – from clerical to army, as well as local government – had urged people to stay at home for the new year, a time when Iranians traditionally travel to see friends and family and celebrate the coming of spring.Alireza Raisi, the deputy health minister, said unless Iran got a grip on the crisis in the next two weeks, the country would be struggling with the disease for six months.Iranian ministers appear to be wary of imposing compulsory France-style quarantines, despite the rising death toll, because the government does not have the resources to provide welfare payments to low-income workers. Five former health ministers had written to the health ministry urging them to take more radical steps.The government has closed schools, universities and shrines, banned religious and cultural gatherings, but has not announced a ban on traffic. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, continued his diplomatic drive to ease US sanctions and spoke to Toshimitsu Motegi, the Japanese foreign minister, after Japan contributed $23m (£19.5m) to help Iran.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director of the World Health Organization, told a Lebanese broadcaster that Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had agreed to ease some of the US sanctions covering banking to allow more medicines to reach Iran. But Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iranian affairs told reporters this week. “Our policy of maximum pressure on the regime continues,” he told reporters. “US sanctions are not preventing aid from getting to Iran.”Iran claims that American promises that medicines and medical equipment are exempt from sanctions are untrue. International banks, wary of US fines, will not permit the transfer of Iran’s financial resources stored in other countries into a Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA), a new humanitarian channel agreed between the Swiss government and the US on 27 February.Despite the tensions between the US and Iran, Michael White, a US citizen jailed by the Iranians three years ago has been released on medical grounds, and is staying at the US embassy in Tehran.

It would, he acknowledged, be “a wrench” for people, and “heartbreaking” for businesses.With the agreement of the three devolved governments, he said, “we are telling – telling – cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight, as soon as they reasonably can, and not open tomorrow”. They would be allowed to sell takeaway food and drink.The same instruction was being given to nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres. The new social distancing measures would be reviewed every month to see if any could be relaxed.There was brief confusion when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who was standing next to Johnson, referred to “shops” as being part of the forced closure. This was later clarified, with No 10 saying this was not the case.A full list of affected venues tweeted by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, also mentioned betting shops, bingo halls, casinos, spas, museums and galleries.Johnson urged people not to decide to go out one final time on Friday: “Please don’t. You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others.”Answering questions, the prime minister confirmed that, if needed, the government would enforce the closures, but added: “In reality I think everyone can see the imperative of doing what is necessary.”Responding to another question, Johnson seemed to dilute the message on social distancing, especially from older people, by saying he hoped to visit his mother on Mother’s Day this Sunday.There had been expectations that such closures would take place only in London, which has notably greater levels of coronavirus infection than other parts of the country.The capital has also had more deaths than any other part of the UK – about a third of the total.The government had been considering a formal ban on Thursday and was braced to announce it, but pulled back. Among senior government figures there was a deep reluctance to issue outright banning orders.Ministers have been under growing pressure to act more decisively, with the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, calling on Friday for immediate action. “It is time for resolute action and not just advice,” he said. “The prime minister must take urgent steps today.“Many are now questioning why pubs and restaurants are still open. It’s not good enough to ask people simply not to go to pubs. Government must act now, shut them while protecting the income of staff and supporting business. If ministers don’t think it’s correct they must explain why.”Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Anecdotal evidence had suggested that Londoners, especially the young, were continuing to go to pubs despite repeated requests to keep away, which led to ministers to believe they now had to issue a ban.Planners are trying to keep within the NHS’s capacity the number of infected people needing intensive hospital treatment. The NHS in London is described as already “close to the edge” in terms of how many critically ill people it can look after at any one time.More pressure is expected on NHS critical care as the number of Covid-19 cases rise, with patients needing oxygen or ventilation machines, and crucially, the staff skilled enough to operate them.More capacity for critical hospital care is coming on-stream, with beds freed up and staff redeployed and retrained, but planners need to keep that predicted increase in capacity ahead of a near-certain expectation of a soaring rise in severe cases when the peak is hit sometime in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224684650ef3393b663d42180b9a77ad0621c91b/0_170_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58cb0731c41afa7c70375b5c3ded1761","title":"mexico fate us brewery put to vote latest amlo plebiscite","story":"President continues direct democracy drive that critics say is skewed towards his desired outcomeThe fate of a giant US brewery under construction in Mexico’s parched borderlands will be put to a vote this weekend in the latest attempt at direct democracy by the country’s populist president.The brewery in Mexicali has provoked controversy in a region where the climate crisis has already caused droughts, and where farmers and residents have taken exception to a US company, Constellation Brands, extracting water to produce beer for export.But the vote over its construction, due to be held on Saturday and Sunday, has drawn criticism from both sides in the row, and unsettled critics of the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.The Mexican leader, popularly known as Amlo, says such plebiscites ensure that “the people have the last word”. But critics say the process is routinely set up to induce the president’s preferred outcomes.“There’s a symbolism in this: that Amlo knows what the majority thinks – or what the majority supposedly thinks,” said Aldo Muñoz Armenta, a political science professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico State. “Where he wants the project to succeed, the consultation gives weight to his decision and he will mobilise his base to make it happen.”The president first unveiled the plan to hold regular plebiscites during the presidential transition in 2018. He initially put a series of 10 projects to national votes, ranging from a refinery to railways and mass tree-planting.Most controversially, he held a consultation on the future of a new airport in Mexico City that was already roughly one-third complete, and voters aligned with his wishes to terminate the project.Another vote in February 2019 approved a gas pipeline in Morelos state despite strong local opposition. The indigenous defender Samir Flores Soberanes, who led the campaign against the project and a related gas-fired electricity plant, was murdered in the days before the vote, prompting Amlo to claim that the killing, while regrettable, had been carried out to undermine the vote.The latest vote, announced at the start of March, comes after nearly three years of simmering tension over the brewery, which residents fear will suck up dwindling water supplies to produce beers including Corona, Modelo and Pacífico.Business groups have cautioned against the plebiscite, warning that a no vote could risk torpedoing investor confidence at a time when the economy is ing and investors are wary after the airport decision.Amlo has claimed that Washington has shown a strong interest in the project succeeding, telling a recent press conference that envoys from the US embassy in Mexico City told him “if the consultation is carried out, the country is going to look bad”.Opponents of the brewery have expressed mixed opinions on the consultation, though they previously pushed for a statewide plebiscite. Constellation Brands declined to comment on the vote.He said a more productive posture would be for the state government and national water commission to accept recommendations from the national human rights commission which found that the project “violated the human right to water”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d2da297d03460f52192acca0cde6403e919a46/894_211_3233_1941/master/3233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc86df694abb610f4f571731535a2907","title":"self isolating stars share washing and workout tips to stay in spotlight","story":"From Gloria Gaynor to Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrities help to stave off boredomVariations on the adage that celebrities are just like us but with better hair, teeth and diets have been put to the test this week as a number of actors, singers and reality stars have made their way onto social media with content inspired by their time in quarantine. They have ranged from public-broadcast-style announcements from Arnold Schwarzenegger to unusual beauty tips from January Jones and digital singalongs with Gal Gadot and friends.Some celebrities’ content has been altruistic and, from a public health perspective at least, helpful, focusing on practical guidelines. Gloria Gaynor, for instance, posted to TikTok a video of herself lip-synching to I Will Survive while lathering up .I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing what’s best for my fellow man“We’re all in this crisis together,” Gaynor told the . “I for one want to do what’s best for myself, my family and my fellow man.

I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing that.“For generations, I Will Survive has become the anthem of the world, to give hope, encouragement and inspiration, and I will continue to make sure that happens.”Mariah Carey also washed her hands to a song from her back catalogue: she and her children posted a video to TikTok of themselves washing their hands to a remix of her 1995 number 1 Fantasy.On Thursday, the American singer JoJo posted a reworked version of her song Leave (Get Out), changing lyrics to give an instructional message the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US would be proud of. Foregrounded by a bowl piled high with shiny lemons, she chides younger viewers who may not be taking isolation warnings seriously: “Tell me why you’re acting so confused when the CDC laid it out for you. Come on I know you’re not dumb to go behind my back and hit the barshows how immature you really are keep exposure to a minimum.”The Pussy Cat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger took the opportunity to promote her band’s new single, React, to wash her hands while singing along dressed in latex.Other celebrities have been offering lifestyle tips specific to their age group. The 72-year-old Schwarzenegger has been posting advice focused on how fellow over-65s can stay fit and well.In one, he poses in front of a giant mural of himself in his flexing heyday while explaining the benefits of cycling as a self-isolation-friendly exercise option. More recently he has extolled the stay-at-home message from in his whirlpool bath while smoking a cigar.January Jones’ Instagram video of her “detox bath” falls into a more corona-adjacent than practical class of celebrity produced content. The former Mad Men actor’s beauty routine is quarantine friendly by dint of being time-consuming. In it she stirs lavender bubbles, baking soda, organic-apple cider vinegar and two scoops of sea salt into a bath tub.

The majority of deaths have been of elderly and at-risk patients.Matt Hancock, who said it was normal for there to be a particular density of cases in some areas, added: “There is a hotspot, not as big as in London, but there is a hotspot in the Midlands. It’s something that we’re looking at very, very closely to find out why, frankly.”A number of theories have begun to emerge to try to understand the high transmission rates in the region.The Birmingham MP, Khalid Mahmood, said elderly Muslim and Sikh people in the area were struggling to adhere to government guidelines surrounding social distancing as they are driven by their religious convictions.Despite most religious services being cancelled, some older people are continuing to attend mosques and gurdwaras to pray, said Mahmood.He added: “Mosques and gurdwaras have told people to stay away but some of the older ones are really struggling. Part of it is because they feel religious observance is more important now than ever – they feel they may die and lose loved ones – so they need to pray. These are people who have incredibly strong religious convictions and it’s hard for them to stay away.”Fears of social isolation and panic buying in supermarkets, with the public queuing next to each other for hours to pay for their goods, could also be contributing to the large cluster.“For some of these elderly people the gurdwara and mosque is where they’ve always met their friends and they are finding it hard to give that up because they are scared of becoming socially isolated,” added Mahmood as he urged the public to do more to help the elderly in the community, setting up FaceTime chats so they could keep in touch with friends and helping them with praying at home.Mahmood and a charity worker, Saidul Saeed, said panic buying could also be a contributing factor.“I have no scientific evidence to back this up and it is wholly anecdotal but panic buying has been a particular problem in Birmingham and you’ve got all these people standing next to each other for hours in queues trying to pay, which is not going to be helping with infections,” said Saeed.Robin May, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Birmingham, said Public Health England (PHE) would be analysing anything unusual in the area’s transmission patterns.He said higher rates of death were expected due to population numbers and Birmingham being the country’s second city but that further analysis would be appropriate to rule out any activity which could potentially be contributing to the sharp rise.“My gut feeling is that these are probably normal variations in the noise of the pandemic – we expect some areas to have more cases,” he said.“That said, it is still really important to be on the lookout for anything unusual. PHE will be looking at the relationships between the contacts in iniduals and those that have been infected. They will be looking for patterns among the cluster. Most likely there will be no connection but it needs to be investigated.”London has so far been the area of the UK with the highest number of cases: the latest figures show the number of infected people in the capital has risen to more than 1,220, with 56 deaths.However, a large cluster of deaths were identified in the West Midlands on Thursday, with the latest mortality figures from NHS England revealing three neighbouring trusts had recorded 21 deaths between them.The Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust reported nine deaths, the highest for any trust in the country. The Dudley Group foundation trust recorded seven deaths, while Sandwell and West Birmingham reported five deaths. Walsall healthcare trust recorded one death.In a statement, the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust said it was now routinely testing people who display respiratory illness symptoms for coronavirus “and, as is the case nationally, a large proportion of these tests are negative. In addition, a number of patients have been discharged from hospital in Wolverhampton and are safely isolating at home.”It said the NHS and the council in Wolverhampton “will be writing to all vulnerable residents providing important guidance to those most at risk”.The Health Service Journal reported that several sources have said the West Midlands pathology services are allegedly struggling to keep up with demand for coronavirus tests, leading to delays in results. It is not clear whether these delays in testing have been attributed to the sharp increase in deaths.PHE West Midlands said there had been some delays. A spokesperson said: “Covid-19 testing is being prioritised for the most unwell patients that are in hospital, and so some previous sample tests from community patients who were well enough to remain at home have been delayed. We have activated national capacity and will process these community samples from this weekend and results will be reported to patients when they are available.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5853159ffb46df50200f838a4e6767e6782b9902/0_176_5670_3402/master/5670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0756e7cb189d9919b6550a247b9703d4","title":"social distancing could needed uk autumn report shows coronavirus","story":"Government documents show thinking behind approach to dealing with coronavirusStrict social distancing measures may need to remain in place until the autumn to have the required impact in controlling the Covid-19 epidemic in the UK, according to government documents that reveal the thinking behind its approach to the crisis.The documents, published online on Friday, give an extraordinary insight into the projected toll of the pandemic, the tactics that government advisers believe will be most effective in containing the spread of the virus and how messaging has been carefully framed to so the public accepts the need for unprecedented changes to daily life.In a consensus statement on the overall strategy being deployed, the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) suggests the UK would need to alternate between “periods of more and less strict social distancing measures” to have a plausible chance of keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity. “These would need to be in place for at least most of a year,” it concludes.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Yes. China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.The advisory group also stresses the need to promote a sense of collectivism in a modern-day spin on “Keep Calm and Carry On”. “All messaging should reinforce a sense of community, that ‘we are all in this together’. This will avoid increasing tensions between different groups,” the documents say.In papers that date from mid-February to the present, the group also considers issues ranging from public disorder to the psychology of self-isolation and potential social impacts of school closures. One paper outlines the potential for unintended consequences and the need to be clear about the purpose of school closures to prevent children from continuing to mix or grandparents taking on childcare responsibilities. Some social and workplace norms will need to be rapidly overturned. For instance, for many healthcare workers it is the norm that people continue to work when unwell. “It will be important to make it socially unacceptable to attend work or school if unwell,” the documents say. “To avoid the risk of stigma, ‘voluntary quarantine’ should be portrayed as an act of altruistic civic duty.”An assessment of the chances of public disorder, drawn up in February, concluded that while “large-scale rioting” seemed unlikely, any disorderwas likely to be generated by anger at the government’s response rather than the direct effects of the pandemic.One 12 March paper on public expectations about measures to stop public gatherings noted there was general support for the move, especially as people could see this happening abroad – and that if policy was not properly explained, people might not trust the government, potentially increasing the risk of disorder.“Acting in a way that does not meet expectations poses a risk that a section of the public will view government actions as incompetent or not in the public’s best interests,” it says. “It may also be taken as signifying that the situation is not expected to be severe for the UK. This could have knock-on implications for public attitudes to other recommendations made by government.”It adds that “the risk of public disorder would be higher if there was a perception that the government’s response was not competent”.Other issues that could cause tensions, it says, include a possible lack of certain goods such as hand sanitisers, not enough police officers because of sickness, and police efforts seen as unfair, for example limiting access to food or healthcare.Particularly, a lack of police numbers “could lead to a rise in opportunistic crime by those who are already antagonistic towards the police”, the paper says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e75676d18d43d064f9ee33dc1a76ea72a59c812d/0_218_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e616fccb6645aeafac57a349c26f9093","title":"were clearing the decks a gp on watching the coronavirus pandemic unfold","story":"Despite the growing death toll and the unprecedented speed at which events are moving, the past few weeks feel like just a prelude of what is to come. By  Gavin FrancisOn 13 January, a bulletin from Health Protection Scotland was sent to all GP practices in the country describing a “novel Wuhan coronavirus”. I work in a small clinic in central Edinburgh with four doctors, two nurses and six admin staff. It was the first time I’d heard of the virus. “Current reports describe no evidence of significant human to human transmission, including no infections of healthcare workers,” it said reassuringly.I cast my mind back to the Sars coronavirus of almost two decades ago, and briefly wondered how quickly the spread of this coronavirus would be stopped, as Sars was. A seafood market had been closed and sanitised. The bulletin said that although Wuhan was a city of 19 million people, there were only three flights per week from there to the UK, and the likely impact was “very low”. I shrugged, and carried on with my work.Scientists had already discovered that the new virus was fundamentally different from Sars, though still within the family of coronaviruses. “Corona” refers to the spiky little packets of sugared protein stuck all over the surface of the spherical virus, like fleurs-de-lys sprouting from the band of a crown. Under an electron microscope they look like tiny planets, each one buzzing with angry satellites. They’re a similar size to flu viruses – 0.1 microns – and are widespread among many different mammals. Sars came to humans from the Asian civet Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) came via dromedary camels. It seems likely that the new virus has its origin in bats, but whether there was another mammalian intermediary between bats and humans is still uncertain.That evening I met up with a friend, a consultant physician who had recently come back to work after a period of time doing research. She had been stationed at a general hospital around 30 miles from Edinburgh, and was enjoying being back in the thick of clinical work, though startled at how stretched her medical colleagues were. “It’s the same every year,” she said. “I wonder when health boards will realise how many winter beds we actually need.”A week later, Chinese infections stood at 550, and the death toll was 17. A new bulletin arrived reassuring me that the risk of infection was still low, but attaching a specific form to be completed should I suspect someone of having the virus – specifically anyone flying in from Wuhan. I was disgruntled but not alarmed when one university asked worried Chinese students to seek GP attention. “By phone!” I wanted them to add, “tell them to seek attention by phone!”On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global health emergency. The death toll in China reached 170, and the cases that had tested positive there reached almost 8,000. Further cases were reported in India and the Philippines.Coronavirus infects and irritates the lungs. Most cases are mild. In severe cases it leads to breathlessness as the lungs struggle to do their job of oxygenating the blood – something that can be relieved with oxygen delivered by mask. A proportion of those patients who require oxygen will go on to need ventilation in intensive treatment units. In these early days of the outbreak, I still thought of the virus as something that, like Mers and Sars, would be contained. As GPs we are accustomed to dealing with an annual spike in flu – the “swine flu” of 2009 turned out to be not much more dangerous than seasonal winter flu – though in its severity and prevalence, this new virus seemed worse.That same day, another message came in, this time from Lothian health board. It instructed me that masks “and other personal protective equipment” would be sent to the practice shortly, prompting the usual jokes among the staff that we would be sent a paper bag and some of those clingfilm gloves you get at petrol stations. Surgical masks did arrive later that week, along with a roll of tear-off plastic aprons.During the week, I work at my small Edinburgh practice, but at the weekend I sometimes work evening GP shifts at an “out of hours” (OOH) centre in the city, covering a much larger population, with a team of other doctors and nurses. I had an email from the clinical director of the centre advising me to tell any patients from mainland China that they would only need to self-isolate if they had symptoms, adding that those symptoms did not include a sore throat. Until then, I’d been assuming that a dripping nose and a sore throat would be the herald of coronavirus infection, the way they are for most respiratory viruses. My practice started a WhatsApp group to keep one another updated. It proved as good for sharing joke videos as for the latest governmental advice.On 4 February, I flew to the US to give a talk at the New York Academy of Sciences about science, medicine and wonder. United Airlines warned me I would be turned back at the US border if I had been through China. There were a few face masks in use at the airport, but I still thought of this as a problem that the Chinese lockdown and the Wuhan flight ban would address.Radio New Zealand had also been in touch to ask if I would do an interview. The absurd levels to which we are all now interconnected came home to me as I sat down, cross-legged and jet-lagged, in a New York hotel room to talk, via Skype, to a presenter 17 hours into tomorrow. He asked me for predictions on how far this epidemic would spread. I remember saying that I had no crystal ball, but what I’d seen of infection control measures in China seemed impressive – I hoped very much it would be contained as Sars had been contained, and that isolation measures would be effective. That day it was reported that 425 Chinese patients had died, and infection rates, for those who’d been tested, stood at just over 20,000.Flying out of Newark, I found myself in a departure terminal where every table was festooned with tablet computers on stalks. They flashed like gambling machines, entertainment as well as shopping opportunities. To speak to a companion it was necessary to peer over these screens. All food and all payment was to be ordered by touching the tablets. Maybe they wipe them clean regularly, I thought, as I watched a kid pick his nose then start playing with the screen.When I got home from New York, in early February, the threat began to feel real. That weekend the number of deaths in China surpassed those of the Sars epidemic of 2002-2003, at 811. Half-term holidays followed. Along with my wife and kids, I drove north to Orkney to see friends and take up a locum position as a GP on one of the islands for a week. At Kirkwall, on my way to the ferry, a message pinged from one of the NHS Orkney staff. Did I have time to drop by the hospital and be measured up for a “face-fitting mask”? These masks are effective at blocking the droplets of coughs or sneezes that carry viruses. It disturbed me that the request came in such haste – did they know something I didn’t about the imminence of the outbreak? In Orkney? I had time if I dropped by the hospital right now, I replied, but had only an hour until my ferry was leaving. “It won’t be necessary,” came the reply, and it wasn’t.By the time I got back to Edinburgh eight days later, things were changing fast. The OOH service asked if I could come by and be assessed for a face-fitting mask. But when I tried to set up an appointment, stocks had run out. New guidance appeared that, for the kind of examinations I perform as a GP, it would be enough to wear a “fluid resistant” mask and follow the usual infection control procedures – aprons, gloves, eye protection. The face-fitted masks were to be preserved for those performing the kind of procedures – such as intubations and endoscopies – during which you might be sprayed with saliva, or worse. Some were finding governmental advice infuriatingly inconsistent, but it was clear that tough decisions were having to be made with limited resources, and time was running out. As GPs we were being urged to avoid suspected cases in case we spread it inadvertently to others, though the virus was undoubtedly circulating among our patients at higher levels than were evident in official figures.On 21 February, Lombardy reported its first cases resulting from spread within Italy, rather than among people who had flown in with the virus. They still had only a handful of confirmed cases. My wife is from Lombardy, not far from Pavia, and her parents went into isolation. Italy reported its first deaths the following day, but several patients of mine were still relaxed enough about the virus to fly there for skiing.In the next four days, Italy’s number of reported cases leapt from single figures to 229, and China’s approached 80,000. But China’s were slowing while Italy’s appeared to be gathering momentum: on 25 February, a new bulletin from the public health specialists of NHS Lothian asked me to tell anyone who had been in Lombardy or Veneto within the last 14 days, and who had symptoms, to self-isolate. “First of all, for reassurance,” it stated, “with regards to Italy, the area of concern is only for northern Italy – north of Pisa, Florence or Rimini.” I was not reassured.I spoke that day with a patient who had returned from Milan, but who had no symptoms other than a slight sore throat, common enough for anyone just off a plane. According to the rules I’d been given, he didn’t have to isolate himself. “Have you got a thermometer?” I asked him, and toyed with the idea of dropping round to see if he had a fever, but then more calls and demands came through, and I didn’t. (He subsequently recovered.)At the OOH centre in West Lothian, in the first week of March, it was evident just how thick the weekly traffic is between Italy and the UK. One among several calls: a man who had flown in a day earlier, from south of Pisa, and who had a cough with a fever. According to the guidance I’d been given, he’d been too far south to be considered as a potential case – I informed him there was no official need for self-isolation. But the advice made me uneasy, and I asked him, if he could, to stay at home and off work for at least a week.Another call was to a family just back from skiing according to the location of their resort they were at risk, and they were referred to the public health board for testing. This is done by sending away an official form – we GPs don’t get to hear who turns out positive and who doesn’t.In early March, the computer system with which GPs read all medical records, make notes on each consultation and refer patients for specialist care, had new coronavirus codes added. The idea is that anyone registered in the system with Covid-19 is tagged with a special code that will keep track of the spread of the disease, as well as our Covid-19 workload as GPs. At this point, “Advice given about 2019-nCoV” was the only code that I had much opportunity to use.To carry on with “containment” of the virus, it felt like we would need hundreds of call-handlers to decide who should stay put and self-isolate, and who should be tested – and then hundreds more workers to trace every contact. Drive-through testing was happening now in Edinburgh, though there was only one mention of the virus today among the 30 or so patients I saw face to face.By now, fear was spreading, with some justification, and the situation was beginning to feel extremely serious. One elderly lady requested a letter for her insurance company, to get her out of her package holiday I explained that until the government changed its advice, my letter wouldn’t make any difference, and she left, dejected.Watching the news, the measures Italy was taking seemed extraordinary, though necessary. Once, when I worked as an Antarctic expedition doctor, I studied with military medics for a diploma in the medical care of catastrophes. We learned about building makeshift hospitals, about iding clinics into “clean” and “dirty” zones, about planning urgent mass vaccination, about emergency medical supply chains. It felt surreal that those kinds of measures were now being discussed so close to home.The gravity of the crisis was only just starting to be felt. It seems incredible now that I was so blase, but on Saturday 6 March, I was out with friends, jokes aplenty about nudging elbows instead of shaking hands. I stood in the corner of a pub packed with people watching the rugby. (England were victorious over Wales.) A GP friend in Fife told me that she was convinced the disease was already widespread among her own patients – she was seeing more viral breathlessness than usual, but none from people who had travelled to the “at risk” areas, and none who fulfilled the criteria for testing. We went together to a sold-out concert at Edinburgh’s Usher Hall – capacity 2,200 – crowds singing, people hugging, everyone pretending to forget about Covid-19 for a night.Another friend, a hospital specialist, told me in a crowded pub that night that what we needed urgently was to slow its spread – allow the government to buy time, get in more ventilators and prepare the hospitals. But he wondered if we were doing too little too late. “We could run out of ventilators by May,” he said. Evidence from China was showing that if you buy ventilators early and deploy them in new and cleared-out hospitals, you save lives.The following day, Italy went into lockdown, but Britons were still being allowed to fly home. The supermarkets there started offering free delivery to the over-65s. My parents-in-law at least have a garden a neighbour is passing fresh bread over the fence. They have their chickens, their vegetable patch and a well-stocked garage. There are frightening stories from Lombardy hospitals of insufficient ventilators, and operating rooms used as intensive-care units.I woke up on 10 March to a WhatsApp message from a colleague – the first few Covid-19 cases from our patch of Edinburgh had been confirmed, all in people returning from Italy. They had a fever, a frontal headache and a dry cough. We were all expecting the news, but it still came like a cold slap. Everything about the way we work would have to change. Planes were still flying in from Italy and France. Websites were telling worried people to phone their GP, while each morning we GPs were picking through emails from local and national health boards for the latest advice. Protective suits were to be saved for hospital staff and paramedics at the bedsides of sick people shedding the virus.There were plenty of nervous jokes among my patients that day about the coming “coronageddon”, but only one who phoned in, drenched in sweat, with a dry cough and a fever of 39C. He hadn’t been abroad for months, and I told him to stay home for at least a week. That evening, my GP colleagues and I had a meeting in the pub that felt like a boozy council of war. We shared stories we’d heard of patients in hospital with the virus, and ideas for how to protect the practice, should we, one-by-one, end up catching it. I remembered planning meetings for the swine flu of 2009, but they were nothing like this, and the threat had felt nowhere near as real.On 11 March, the WHO declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic. Events were moving at unprecedented speed. The UK budget was delivered and the NHS was told it would have whatever it needed. We’ll see. Deaths in China continued to drop – just 19 new infections.A helpful message signed by all the government health departments, health boards, royal colleges and the General Medical Council also arrived on 11 March. It said that I’ll be expected, in the coming weeks, to go beyond what I’m accustomed to dealing with, but that I can be reassured that the GMC and health board will support me and my decisions through the crisis. “Clinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.” It’s good to feel the GMC is at my back, rather than on my back, for a change.Among my worried patients were a grandmother with full parental responsibility for all her grandchildren. A mother of a seven-year-old daughter who has a fever and cough asked whether that means she should also be self-isolating. According to official guidance, the answer was still a disquieting “no” – we were still in the “containment” phase – but I asked people to be pragmatic. If they felt at all unwell, stay in and minimise contact with others. The only unconcerned patient was a man with advanced cancer, spread to the liver, who thought we were all overreacting.By this point, we GPs were doing almost everything over the phone, even if it meant prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients, and making guesses about non-urgent diagnoses – shunting anything that wasn’t an emergency into an imagined future of normality. Over morning coffee, my colleague joked about getting us beekeeper outfits, visiting only the most seriously ill in their homes while hermetically sealed in our own isolation suits. As jokes go, it wasn’t very funny.I spent the afternoon doing a men’s clinic for the city’s rough sleepers and those with no fixed address, some of whom sleep in Bethany Trust dormitories. In my morning surgery, everyone had asked me about the virus my homeless patients had, it seems, more pressing concerns. About half went to shake my hand, and thought me cowardly for bumping elbows instead.By the time I emerged from the clinic, Boris Johnson had told everyone with cough and cold symptoms to stay home for a week. “At last!” I thought. Maybe people will take it seriously. We were again informed that more protective equipment was coming, but the droplet-resistant masks still won’t be available. Everyone with a beard who works with Covid-19 patients has been asked to shave it off, as the masks don’t work if there’s hair between them and the skin. Anyone with religious or cultural objections was told to speak with their line manager.Friday the 13th, and an atmosphere of dread in morning meeting at the news from Italy. There aren’t enough ventilators to go round, or nurses, and people are being buried without funerals. The practice WhatsApp group has been renamed “Dream Team CoronaCombat” in an attempt at levity. There was an air of quiet resignation at what’s coming, but an edge of bunker humour, too. One of the clinic thermometers broke, and I went online to buy another – £30 versions are changing hands for £125. But virologists are learning about Covid-19 all the time, and for all their horrors, the Chinese and Italian experiences mean that we’re better prepared in the UK than we might have been.One of my patients that day, a man in his late 80s, told me that the virus is mother nature getting back at us. “Too many people!” he said, and chuckled. “All us oldies need clearing out!” I didn’t share his glee. Some who have had coughs for weeks, but that have worsened, asked me if they’d got it – but there’s no way of knowing, and I told them all to stay home for a further week. The lab had stopped accepting viral swabs from GPs, so unless someone is admitted to hospital, they aren’t tested. And also on the 13th, the first death in Scotland, in Ediburgh, was announced.Spain followed Italy into lockdown, planes turning back halfway. The UK attitude of allowing schools to stay open came under attack. It was obvious we needed new ways to slow the spread, particularly among the over-65s – they’re the ones most at risk from this disease. One of my colleagues has purchased us hazmat suits from eBay for home visiting, just in case. The medical students of Edinburgh University have set up a pet-and-babysitting service for NHS staff.On Tuesday 17 March, the practice was oddly quiet – there was a hush on the streets, a sense of anxious anticipation, and my days now feel like a prelude to what is to come. People were stunned by the implications of the guidance delivered by the prime minister on Monday night – to avoid going out, to avoid restaurants and theatres, to self-isolate for 14 days if anyone in the family has symptoms. Unprecedented, necessary, belated advice. Of the 20 people I spoke to on the phone, a couple almost certainly had the virus – a new headache, fever, cough, malaise and exhaustion. I coded them “suspected coronavirus infection” and gave advice to stay in with their whole families, and call us if they get worsening breathlessness.As healthcare workers, we’ve been told to follow the same advice as everyone else: stay off for 14 days if anyone in our homes has a cough or fever. Practices adjacent to my own are already losing staff, and we’re clamouring for testing. If I develop a cough but test negative, I can go on working. Even better will be some future test that can show if I’ve had the virus, and developed immunity – then I’ll be able to work overtime through the coming weeks without fear. Hospital clinics are being cancelled wherever possible, all elective surgery postponed. We’re clearing the decks for an onslaught. Yes, it would have been nice to have been better prepared for this pandemic, but though it’s frightening, it could also be worse, and I don’t feel the same anger as some of my colleagues towards the government for its prevarication over such immense and unprecedented decisions.On Wednesday I heard that schools are closing, and so my wife and I will be contending with the competing necessities of the kids, the virus and the NHS. My wife contacted her GP in Lombardy. The situation is, he said, very grave, and he wished us luck with what is to come. I messaged a medical contact in Beijing, the Chinese translator of my books, who said things are improving, with few new cases. “As you know, isolation is the only effective method to stop the virus,” he added, and asked that I give thought to the mental health of my patients as much as to their physical needs. He ended on a sanguine note: “People will have to change their habits for a while. The spring is coming.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc069902b69ef57621e1205fd5f772a288700fc/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d4f658fd78993d7b2822efcb11c9f4f","title":"wine cooler global heating helps swedens vineyards to success","story":"As climate change makes winemaking a torrid business in southern Europe, viniculture is taking off in ScandinaviaIn a corner of his whitewashed 18th-century homestead, Håkan Hansson – the fifth generation of his family to farm this gently undulating stretch of land in southern Sweden – keeps a worn set of diaries, but not just for sentimental reasons.From the early 1950s, Hansson’s mother, a keen amateur meteorologist, meticulously wrote down every detail of the weather in Skåne county. Her records show why, 70 years later, her son is now one of a fast-growing band of increasingly successful – and award-winning – Swedish winemakers.“It’s really quite clear,” said Hansson, 68, a former financier who planted his first vines on the south-facing slopes of what is now the Hällåkra vineyard in 2003, and today has about 22,000 on 6.5 hectares.“We have an extra month of summer now. And winters are not like what they used to be. That’s why we can make wine, and why 50 years ago, we couldn’t.”September, Hansson said, used to be the month when temperatures would plummet, but not any more: “Now we’re seeing daytime temperatures of 24 or 25C, even at the end of the month, with perfect, cool nights. Impossible when I was a kid, and not very different from Burgundy.”Denmark now has about 90 commercial vineyards, compared with two in 2005, while Sweden has 50. A handful of bold pioneers are growing grapes in Finland, and the world’s most northerly functioning vineyard overlooks Norway’s largest fjord.They are, of course, infinitesimally small beer compared with the more established winemakers of southern and central Europe: according to Sveneric Svensson of the Swedish Wine Association, Sweden has barely 125 hectares of land under vine, against an estimated EU total – mostly in France, Italy and Spain – of 3.3m.Output is tiny: Sweden produced less than 450,000 litres of wine in 2019 France alone made more than 4.5bn. “We are still very much in our infancy,” Svensson said. “But commercial production is now serious. And the quality of the wine is very encouraging. There’s excellent feedback, from around the world.”Scandinavia’s combination of longer daylight hours – up to 25 hours a week in high summer – and lower temperatures make for white and sparkling wines with “a really fresh, crisp acidity that is becoming harder and harder to achieve further south in Europe”, Svensson said, where increasingly fierce summer highs greatly increase the sugar content in the ripening grapes.Early Scandinavian wine pioneers searched long for varieties that would suit this nascent Nordic terroir, and had to learn on the job how to turn them into something drinkable, said Murre Sofrakis, who first planted an experimental half-hectare of vines in his father’s market garden in Klagshamn, just outside Malmö, in 2001.“Growing is one thing, but producing something decent is very much another,” Sofrakis said in the small but spotless winery of the Flädie vineyard, where – on top of the two hectares of his own that he now has under vine at Klagshamn – he looks after a further three for the estate’s owner.The grape variety most Swedish winemakers have settled on is solaris, a hardy hybrid developed from riesling and pinot gris, for their whites. Created in 1975 in Freiburg in southern Germany, the variety is “particularly suited to Scandinavian conditions”, Sofrakis said. “It just really seems to like it here. It’s our insurance policy: even in a bad year, it will make a good wine.”The most common variety for reds is rondo, created in 1964 in the former Czechoslovakia by cross-breeding St Laurent, a classic grape more usually seen in the European Alps – although several growers, including Hansson, have now also begun successfully producing pinot noir.“Up here, it’s a constant and necessary process of trial and error,” Hansson said. “Each year, we try something new in a small part of the vineyard. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. We now know, for example, that merlot isn’t possible here. Very nice leaves, totally lousy grapes.”One advantage that Scandinavia’s neophyte winemakers have over southern European producers is that their more recently developed grape varieties, grown in a cooler climate make for markedly more disease-resistant vines.“The wine industry, as a whole, uses a lot of chemicals,” said Sofrakis. “It’s common practice in France, for example, to spray your vines between 14 and 18 times. Here, I haven’t sprayed once in 18 years.”Hansson, along with several Swedish winemakers, now sells to top restaurants in Sweden as well as exporting to sommeliers and specialist wine merchants in cities such as Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. But it has not always been easy. In the early days, he said, finding a customer was as hard as producing a good wine.“Wine drinkers here were used to a big, classic, southern European flavour profile, which we obviously didn’t match,” he said.But 15 years on, said Mick Daly, an Australian former engineer who now works with Hansson, the fact that the wine “is local, the product of a terroir, of our specific climate and conditions in Skåne … it used to be a negative it’s now a positive. We’re no longer just a novelty. People who used to take a glass now take a bottle.”Cracking the Swedish retail market was doubly hard because low production volumes mean prices are necessarily high – typically €25-30 (£23-28) a bottle – and, unlike in Denmark, only the state-run monopoly, Systembolaget, is allowed to sell alcohol in Sweden. Winemakers cannot sell their product on-site or by mail order.But as the quality of Swedish wines has improved, more official stores have begun selling them. “The quality is really getting there,” said Joel, an assistant manager at Systembolaget’s central Malmö outlet, which now offers a dozen different Swedish white, sparkling, red and dessert wines. “There’s quite a buzz.”At Bloom in the Park, his Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking the lake in the city’s Pildammarna park, Igi Vidal said he was “proud to introduce diners to Swedish wines as objectively fine as these”. Of the five glasses Vidal serves blind with his chef’s much-lauded five-course tasting menu, at least two will be Swedish.“Some early vintages,” he confesses, “I wouldn’t have brushed my teeth with. But over the last five years or so, the quality has soared. People who really know something about wine are gobsmacked. You give them a glass, they love it, then you tell them where it comes from they say, ‘You’re kidding. That’s from Sweden?’”Vidal has a special fondness for the wines produced by Göran Amnegård of the Blaxsta estate near Stockholm, whose dessert ice wine – hailed as “glorious … a golden treasure” by the wine critic Jancis Robinson – first put Swedish wine on the map in 2007 when it collected a raft of international awards.“The guy’s a genius,” Vidal said, appreciatively nursing a glass of Amnegård’s 2016 chardonnay. “Who would have thought someone would ever produce something like this in Sweden? Round, creamy, golden … Comparable with some of the world’s best.”Scientists say the world’s wine map could be fundamentally changed by global heating, with traditional winemaking regions in southern Europe, as well as Australia, California and Latin America, becoming simply too hot while more northerly areas such as the UK, the Netherlands and Scandinavia boom.That does not mean northern vineyards will find life easy. Rising temperatures may have improved growing conditions, but global heating also means more extreme and unpredictable weather: heavy rain, violent storms and hail. “It’s not just an advantage,” said Hansson. “It’s a challenge, too. We will need to be very good growers.”The challenges in southern Europe, however, look daunting. In Spain and Italy, winemakers are moving to higher altitudes and planting on north-facing slopes to prevent record temperatures ripening grapes too fast, boosting their sugar and alcohol content to unacceptable levels and irreversibly altering their flavour.In France, scientists at the Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin in Bordeaux are exploring how more heat- and drought-resistant grape varieties from countries such as Georgia, Portugal and Tunisia fare in south-west France against traditional Bordeaux varieties such as merlot, which is thought to be unlikely to survive the coming decades.Faced with global heating, producers in the chateaux of the Bordeaux region are hampered by strict rules governing how their wine must be made if it is to qualify for the Bordeaux appellation: irrigation is not allowed and a true Bordeaux wine can be made from just six authorised grape varieties.Nordic growers, meanwhile, see mostly upside to the changes ahead. “Serious money” was now being invested in Swedish vineyards, Sofrakis said, the largest of which now have up to 20 hectares under vine. What was once a retirement hobby has become a career option: ambitious young Swedes are studying winemaking in France and California before returning to work in the industry at home.“There’s a critical mass now, a momentum,” he said. “We have the conditions to produce quality wines there aren’t many places in the world like this. We’re winning prizes – and we’re still learning. I reckon it’s a 30-year curve: 10 years to indulge your passion, 10 to gain experience, 10 to professionalise. I’m very confident.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:  Craig LassigReuters A race is being fought from every corner of the world to find a coronavirus vaccine. It is an immense effort involving co-operation between countries, institutions and researchers in a collective move against one enemy the greatest health threat to humanity in a century.Some 35 companies and academic institutions – some with Irish virologists and immunologists – are involved. At least four say they already have candidates being tested in animals and want to test on humans. But this requires careful evaluation of need risk in cutting some corners (understandable given what’s unfolding) and efficacy.The one discordant note was a report – later denied – that US president Donald Trump was seeking to acquire the expertise of a German biotech company regarded by many as leading the race. CureVac hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July, and will then seek go-ahead from regulators for human testing with a view to it being available by year end.Unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to China. It sequenced the genetic make-up of Sars-CoV-2 (its medical term) and shared it in January, allowing researchers around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.This also assisted in developing testing kits to confirm infectivity and potential antiviral agents. Past experience with Sars, Mers, H1N1 and swine flu also suggests vaccine development could be quicker than before.Another vaccine developed by US biotech company Moderna is to be injected into healthy volunteers in Seattle shortly. “This was reputedly prepared and ready for testing in 42 days, which is an incredibly rapid response,” says Trinity College Dublin immunologist Prof Kingston Mills.A vaccine is the single best way to achieve “herd immunity”, ie protection for whole populations, while vaccination of care givers and medical staff would do a lot to prevent exposure to the more vulnerable.Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin says the technology required is not hugely challenging. There is a vaccine already in use in agriculture to prevent avian bronchitis virus – a coronavirus. The difficulty centres around demonstrating safety, efficacy and scaling up manufacturing.He cites the case of generating a flu vaccine every year, work on which is conducted in February-March for use the following winter season. There is a six-month lead in but that is made possible by the body of built-up research. That kind of work has not been done with Covid-19. That is why the predominant view is that a vaccine is 12 to 18 months away.TrialsA major difficulty will be where trials are conducted. They are usually done where there is uncontrolled community transmission, de Gascun explains, yet most places in the world are now locked down or subject to social isolation. Moreover, large numbers are required, because we are talking about vaccinating whole populations.That means tens of thousands of people at the critical Phase 3 stage of evaluation. It may be a case of going back to China as it has lifted restrictions (except on foreign travel).Developing a vaccine is not straightforward there are many unknowns. It remains to be seen if it’s going to become a seasonal flu-like virus. While Sars became extinct because of effective infection controls, de Gascun notes Covid-19 has challenging characteristics. These include a very high “viral load” initially, which may even be high before the onset of symptoms, and yet there is no link between viral load on how sick a person becomes.A big question is what happens when containment is lifted. He believes a certain proportion of people will have immunity. If it behaves like flu, there is a risk it might come back in the autumn. “It’s going to be here for a while. The big question is: does it become like seasonal flu? It’s too early to say.”The first phase in testing sees a small number of healthy adults given the vaccine. The Seattle trial will enrol 45 adults. Phase 2 trials test safety in a larger group of people and look for expected effects in the body. The stringent testing is Phase 3 when many thousands of people are required.He acknowledges frustration among the public about the absence of a drug or vaccine. “But if you put something on the market that doesn’t work or causes side effects, then you lose the confidence of the public.”Many are involved because small groups of people may turn out to be at risk of rare side effects because of age, genetic makeup or underlying health conditions. On the upside, Sars-CoV-2 is not expected to change much whereas influenza tends to mutate.Age-targeted formulationsIrish scientist Dr David Dowling is looking at how substances called adjuvants could render Covid-19 vaccines more effective. The aim is to design formulations that work well in older people – the most vulnerable – which can be delivered widely and affordably, where a lesser dose is needed but protection is conferred.“Right now, we are working with collaborators in moving forward several vaccines against the virus,” says Dowling, principal investigator with the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital in the US.“Our research has already shown we can do this age targeting for babies with the pneumococcal vaccine – a vaccine that’s very expensive to produce,” he explains. “Delivering the pneumococcal vaccine along with adjuvants that stimulate the immune response in babies means you need less of the actual vaccine for it to work, so it’s more cost-effective.”With colleagues at Harvard Medical School they are researching new, age-targeted formulations using an existing experimental vaccine against the 2003 Sars coronavirus, to prove the concept. They will need time to be developed and tested, but he hopes this will lead to more useful vaccines.“I would like to see several vaccines available against this coronavirus, because different groups of people may need different vaccine approaches,” says Dowling, who is from Bray and got his PhD from Dublin City University. “If we don’t take factors like age-related changes in immune responses and vaccine cost into account, this could potentially lead to shortages and conflicts later on. It is worth investing in the research on this now.”The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is supporting many of the lead vaccine contenders. Created in 2017 to speed vaccine development for new diseases because of heightened risk of a pandemic from a flu or novel coronavirus, it’s funded by governments in Germany, Japan and Norway, the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust.Because a vaccine is up to 18 months away, other treatments assume greater importance, notably antivirals, de Gascun says. A number of options are already in clinical trials. They are easier to do with a different risk-benefit ratio. All told, it’s an easier sell in terms of investment, doing the checks and going into production. But scaled-up action on both fronts must be the global priority.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4207818.1584717264!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i could only hold her hand while dressed in a biohazard suit with gloves","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSiobhan Cullen has urged everyone to take very seriously the advice given about combatting the spread of the coronavirus. Photograph: iStockThe daughter of a woman who died in a Dublin hospital on Wednesday from the coronavirus, has spoken about having to visit her while wearing a hazardous materials suit and a protective mask.Siobhan Cullen, daughter of Eileen O’Neill, of Loughlinstown, Dublin 18, who died in St Vincent’s Hospital after being taken there following a fall at home, said on her Twitter account that “never in a million years” did she think she would have to experience such a “nightmare”.Ms O’Neill, who was 88-years-old, was taken by ambulance to the accident and emergency unit of the Dublin hospital on March 13th, after experiencing a fall in her home. Because she had a high temperature, she was tested for the coronavirus and the result was positive, Ms Cullen said.‘Warrior’On Wednesday, she wrote on her Twitter account: “At 15.20 today I said goodbye to a warrior. I could only hold her hand while dressed in a biohazard suit with double gloves, and double face shields. She struggled almost to the very end.”She wrote that thankfully her mother was now at rest, but that the reality of the coronavirus epidemic meant funeral arrangements were outside the family’s control. “No-one can pay their respects.”The previous day, also on Twitter, she wrote that she was “with her holding her hand. She’s really struggling. Please pray that she goes soon \u0026amp peacefully.”Ms Cullen said her mother had not left the house in weeks, and had only been in contact with six people, including her two carers, yet she had caught the virus.In the hospital, she said, her mother was put in total isolation once she had tested positive, with people “in space suits” coming in and out. On March 13th, Ms Cullen tweeted that her mother had been taken to A\u0026ampE in an ambulance, and that visitors were not allowed.She wrote later on the same day: “Finally made contact. Not a stroke but being tested for the unmentionable. Results tomorrow eve at earliest. No visitors. In isolation.”The next day she wrote that her mother was in an isolation ward and was being treated for a severe infection.On March 15th, she wrote: “Staff run off feet. She’s very poorly today. Finally got hold of a nurse who said would ring me in 5 mins. Not their fault.” And then: “Just rang. Mother positive.”She thanked those who responded on Twitter with messages of sympathy, and said the hardest part was knowing how poorly her mother was, but not being able to see her or hold her hand, while finding it difficult to get information.On March 16th, she wrote: “So am now in self isolation. Can’t even walk dog in middle of night. Urgent request for test gone through. Will update as it happens as this is new experience for us all. I’m to get a call.”MovedThe same day she wrote that her mother had been moved nearer to the nurses’ station so she could be watched more closely, and that she was wheezing very badly on the phone. She died two days later.Contacted by The , Ms Cullen said she was so upset she could not speak about what had happened. She has urged everyone to take very seriously the advice that is being given about social isolation and the effort being organised to combat the spread of the coronavirus.Ms Cullen posted a link to the death notice for her mother, who was pre-deceased by her husband, Michael, and is survived by her son, daughter, two in-laws, four children, her brother, and nieces and nephews.“Funeral will be strictly private,” it states. “A memorial mass to honour Eileen’s life will be held in the future.”On Friday, on her Twitter account, Ms Cullen said her late mother’s two carers, and her public health nurse, had all tested negative for coronavirus. She said she and the others who had been in close contact with her late mother were still waiting to be tested.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Jacqueline McGovern was one of two women struck by a car as she walked on a footpathUK\u0026rsquos cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close after announcement by Boris JohnsonAir Accident Investigation Unit concludes investigation into crash which killed twoGarda\u0026iacute are investigating following fatal incident involving car and lorry on the N2Health services in some local areas keen establish local databases to assist with coronavirus responseLeo Varadkar hopeful new emergency powers given to force will not need to be usedDoherty says employers will not face penalties for topping up pay of laid off staffNewspaper industry groups call on Government to protect printing press supply chainMain difficulties centre around demonstrating safety, efficacy and scaling up manufacturingBuild-to-rent apartment and other proposals for Bonnington discussed at \u0026lsquovirtual\u0026rsquo meeting\u0026lsquoThe coronavirus has no political consideration.

The group, which represents the national newspaper industry, wrote to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Friday. It asks that in any further measures to halt the spread of the virus, allowances would be made so journalists could continue their work to keep the public informed during the crisis. The British government has published a list of roles it considers “key workers” in responding to the coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. The list includes doctors, nurses, healthcare support staff, those involved in medical and food supply chains, and public services such as justice, education, policing and the military. It also includes journalists due to their role in keeping the public informed during the crisis. In a letter, Newsbrands chief executive Ann Marie Lenihan called on Mr Varakdar to “guarantee that news providers will be treated as an ‘essential service’ in the event of further movement restrictions” in Ireland. Newsbrands asked the Government to “ensure that journalists have free movement to continue to fulfil their essential role informing citizens and reporting on the crisis”.Given the media’s role in informing the public it is essential that supply chains to newspaper printing plants are maintained, and that retailers continue to stock newspapers as an essential item in shops, the letter stated. The letter was co-signed by Johnny O’Hanlon, director of Local Ireland, the body representing local and regional newspapers. The correspondence laid bare the difficulties facing the news-publishing industry, due to a drastic decline in advertising revenue as the financial impact of the global pandemic hits Irish businesses. The letter warned “quality journalism and news delivery rely heavily on advertising revenues”, which are “rapidly disappearing”.Across national and local newspapers advertising was down by between 45 and 65 per cent last week, with similar drops expected in the coming weeks, the two industry groups warned. “We cannot overstate the scale of the crisis facing the news publishing industry in the coming weeks,” noted the letter.Due to the financial strain, “a number of smaller local publishers may be forced to cease or suspend publication within weeks, leaving local communities without any vital local independent and trusted news provision”, the letter added. Authorities have appealed for people to avoid misinformation about the virus shared on social media and in messaging apps, and to only trust information provided on the Health Service Executive’s website and from the media.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4207900.1584712520!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national unity government idea should be examined says mcdonald","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald TD and Louise O’Reilly TD speaking to media outside Government Buildings, Dublin on Monday. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said the idea of a national unity government to deal with the coronavirus crisis should be examined. The proposal has thus far been given a cool reception by the leaderships of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and previously Sinn Féin but Ms McDonald, in her latest comments, has opened the door to discussing the idea. However, she still expressed some doubts.The Dublin Central TD was asked about a government of national unity on Today FM on Friday morning and said: “We need to look at every option. The issue with a national unity government is how exactly would it work and would it be coherent enough to respond quickly. “That is the concern but yes there is merit of course in all of the political forces coming together because we all represent different sections of our people, whatever our views on other political matters. “I think we can all agree that we want to do everything possible to keep our families and our communities safe, to save jobs where we can but certainly to ensure that people have proper income supports so they can get by and come out of this crisis in one piece.“It is one of the options on the table. I still think a better option would be a government for change that reflects the outcome of the last election but I don’t hold all of the cards in this and my concern and our concern at this time is to do the right thing for people and certainly that unity government option needs to be looked at, absolutely.” Ms McDonald also said she has not given up on the possibility of Sinn Féin being in government but stressed issue in the “here and now” is getting the country through the current coronavirus, also known as Covid-19crisis.“I know that people voted for change. I am really conscious that change needs to be delivered and we are determined to achieve that but in the immediacy of the here and now this is now about protecting, having people’s backs in what is a very difficult situation.”Green deputy leader Catherine Martin said she is glad her party’s “proposal of unity government is being considered by other political parties now”. “We need unity of focus in this unprecedented health crisis,” the Dublin Rathdown TD said.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4208150.1584728442!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"republican senators criticised over reports of stock sale before market meltdown","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            US Senator Richard Burr reportedly sold sold between $628,000 (€ 587,000) and $1.7 million (€ 1.5m) worth of stock on February 13th.

Photograph: Mandel NganAFPGetty ImagesTwo Republican senators faced calls to resign on Friday over media reports they sold substantial amounts of stock before the global coronavirus-induced market meltdown after receiving private briefings on the outbreak.Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr sold between $628,000 (€ 587,000) and $1.7 million (€ 1.5m) worth of stock on February 13th, in 33 separate transactions, after offering public assurances the government was ready to battle the virus, according to nonprofit investigative journalism group ProPublica.Mr Burr’s committee has been receiving daily updates on the outbreak.Two weeks after the stock sale, the North Carolina Republican told a luncheon on Capitol Hill that the coronavirus was much more aggressive in its transmission “than anything that we have seen in recent history,” according to a recording obtained by National Public Radio.Mr Burr issued a statement Friday morning saying he relied only on public news reports to guide his decision on the February 13th stock sale.“Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,” Mr Burr said.Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler sold $1.28 million (€ 1.19m) to $3.1 million (€ 2.9m) in stocks from January 24th through mid-February in 29 transactions, two of which were purchases, according to The Daily Beast. The report said the sales began on the day her health committee hosted a private coronavirus briefing for senators.Ms Loeffler wrote overnight on Twitter that she was informed of the transactions three weeks after they occurred.“This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisers without my or my husband’s knowledge or involvement,” she said.But by early Friday, critics on both ends of the political spectrum were calling on both lawmakers to consider resigning.Mr Burr, who is in his third term, as a senator, has said he will not seek re-election in 2022. Ms Loeffler - who was appointed to her seat by Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, after the resignation of Johnny Isakson - is running for re-election to complete the remaining two years of Mr Isakson’s term.“It is stomach-churning that the first thoughts these Senators had to a dire \u0026amp classified #COVID briefing was how to profit off this crisis. They didn’t mobilize to help families, or prep response. They dumped stock,” Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.The “#COVID” hashtag referred to Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.Tucker Carlson, a conservative Fox News commentator, told his viewers on Thursday night: “Maybe there is an honest explanation for what (Burr) did. If there is, he should share it with the rest of us immediately. Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate and face prosecution for insider trading.”The controversy swirled as senators from both parties were due to meet with Trump administration officials to try to devise a rescue plan for an economy reeling from the coronavirus, after Republicans made a $1 trillion opening bid.The massive Republican package unveiled on Thursday includes checks of up to $1,200 each for many Americans, and hundreds of billions of dollars in loans for small businesses and industries.

In 1999 John F. Kennedy Jr died in a small plane crash off the island\u0027s coast.Brian Packish, a local councillor, said private jets had been pouring in to the small airport on Martha\u0027s Vineyard in recent days.Gordon Healy, an assistant manager at the local animal shelter, told the Boston Globe: If you don’t need to be here, if you don’t have a reason to be here, it doesn’t make sense for you to be here. I don’t speak for everyone on the island, but I think it’s a pretty common belief.John Christensen, a local official, added: I’ve never seen grocery carts so full.Officials warned that the island\u0027s population was mostly elderly, and vulnerable to the virus.Those on Nantucket asked the Massachusetts emergency management agency to reduce the number of people allowed to travel there.The local hospital said it only had 14 beds and no intensive care unit, meaning victims would have to be airlifted to Boston if there was an outbreak.However, wealthy people who have second homes on the islands rejected suggestions they should stay on the mainland, and said they would practice proper social distancing.One former US ambassador heading to Nantucket, told the Boston Globe: A lot of people are retreating, whether they’re going to the Cape or New Hampshire or some more isolated place that’s off the beaten path.It’s hard to know to do the right thing in these times, but this feels like the right thing.Further north in Maine, the island of North Haven 12 miles off the coast, voted to ban visitors and seasonal residents, who spend the winter in warmer states like Florida.The ruling, which has since been watered down, was intended to put a brake on the traditional summer invasion which adds around 2,000 to the year-round population of 355.Gordon Bubar, 74, who runs the local grocery, said: We don’t have a hospital. You have to get there by boat. It is a bad situation and it is a very bad disease.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"unionism crossroads irish border poll inevitable","story":"Johnny King is an unlikely subversive but the soft-spoken native of east Belfast has caused a minor earthquake among Ulster unionists.  The 51-year old from a staunchly protestant loyalist background – his father was an Orangeman – recently wrote a newspaper column in the nationalist-leaning Irish News claiming that a united Ireland is the best way forward for the province.Unsurprisingly the piece prompted a backlash among some sections of the unionist community, but perhaps not as many as would have been the case in the past. Mr King claims almost every unionist he knows agreed with his argument, although they were unwilling to say so publicly.“We are moving inexorably to a united Ireland position. Unionists should not be burying their heads in the sand about this,” Mr King tells The  in one of Belfast’s most famous watering holes, The Garrick, close to the city centre.Unionism has suffered a number of setbacks over the past few months. The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has put a de facto regulatory and customs border down the Irish sea and Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA, won the popular vote in the recent general election in the south of Ireland. Both of these have put question marks over the future place of Northern Ireland as part of the UK.Most unionists, whether publicly or privately, are in agreement that it is not a question of if but when a border poll takes place.In the next few weeks the Belfast Court of Appeal will deliver a judgement in a potentially landmark case. If Raymond McCord, a victims’ rights activist prevails, then he will force the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to publish the exact criteria that will trigger a border poll. There is a growing consensus on both parts of the island that it will happen within the next five-to-ten years.Unionism is split on what to do next. Mr King is on one end of the spectrum. He has joined the SDLP, a moderate nationalist party, and warns that unionists must engage with discussions on unity or risk getting swept away by the tide of history.His argument is that the rationale for loyalism has been undermined by the British government. “What is the point of being a loyalist if that loyalty isn’t reciprocated.” He cites the Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement as evidence the London would sell out the province if it is in its interests.He adds that the £10bn subvention from the exchequer every year need to keep the “the most troublesome part of the empire” afloat will strengthen the British government’s resolve to sever ties with the province. He says that unionists should engage now with events such as ‘Future Ireland’ - a forum set up to discuss in what circumstances unity would make sense – to ensure that “Northern Ireland’s rich culture and traditions” are fully protected in a new dispensation.On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Reverend Mervyn Gibson, a Presbyterian minister and the current grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. Speaking at the Orange museum in the heart of loyalist east Belfast, Mr Gibson, 62, says there will be a border poll in his lifetime but it has no chance of passing. He says his commitment to the union is not about economics, although that is a compelling argument, it is about cultural identity. “I am British and there is no place for me or people like me in a united Ireland.”Mr Gibson says that he has no intention of engaging with any discussions on a united Ireland.“If the future is a pre-determined outcome of a united Ireland, then that is not engagement. That is working out the terms of surrender.”He adds that unionism has to broaden its appeal and reach out to Catholics and ethnic minorities who want to remain part of the UK.Underlining the pace of change in Northern Ireland, Mr Gibson says that even though he is a Christian and “my moral values would be seen as outdated these days but they are still my moral values but we need members of the LGBT community to support the union as well. We need a range of people to support union. We don’t always need to agree on moral issues, but we can agree on supporting the union.”The threat of dissident paramilitary violence is ever present in the province. Last month it emerged that the Real IRA had tried to explode a bomb on a ferry going from Belfast to Stranraer to coincide with Brexit day on January 30th.Mr King warns that if a border poll is rushed and the result is a crude majority in favour of unification, but the complex constitutional, economic, cultural and security issues remain unresolved, then it threatens to plunge the province back into armed conflict. This is a view that is shared widely in politicians on both sides of the border.Northern Ireland’s troubled past is very evident on the streets of Belfast. People are willing to give their views on a united Ireland, but not their names and background. The issue is too sensitive.“I was against Brexit. I want to be part of Europe. Freedom to travel is a big thing for me. That is one thing that would make me favour a united Ireland. I don’t think it would happen for a long time though,” a female in her late twenties says.A middle aged man who worked as a lawyer says a united Ireland won’t happen in his lifetime. “I think what Sinn Fein is doing is very dangerous. Too many people don’t want a united Ireland. All this talk of a border poll is going to be very destabilising. Stormont is just back up and running. We have a lot of problems we need to sort out.”As Northern Ireland prepares to celebrate its centenary in May 2021, the future is more uncertain than anytime in the past. A next census which will be released next year is expected to show a majority of Catholics in the province for the first time.However, privately many unionists say that the future position of Northern Ireland will be settled by how Brexit unfolds and whether Scotland eventually secedes from the UK. Of these, the position of Scotland is seen as a gamechanger.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday evening news briefinguk shutdown tonight","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

We dearly want to squash the exponential rise in infections, but we don\u0027t want to copy Wuhan in having a complete lockdown. We want to keep the economy going and not be confined to our homes. Is this possible?The experience of Singapore and some other East Asia countries suggests that it could be. They were among the first to get infections from Wuhan because they have much more interaction with China than we do. Yet now, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong all have far fewer infections than the UK (see the world map below). What might we learn from their examples?Most of the things they have done, we are doing, too. The main difference is that they have done them more actively and aggressively from the start. One thing they have been most aggressive about is restricting arrivals from other countries. Even when people have arrived, they have been tested and often required to go into quarantine.Screening arrivals in Taiwan has seen officials going on to planes and doing temperature checks on the passengers. Testing by temperature and by specific tests for the Covid-19 is much more common in these countries. It is normal for anyone with symptoms to get the test without any need to have travelled recently from a badly affected part of the world.Self-isolation and quarantine are taken far more seriously and enforced. A person who breaks quarantine in Singapore or Hong Kong will face a significant fine. Both territories have used specially commandeered buildings to enforce quarantine. They also work hard to trace who has been in contact with an infected person. In Singapore, the police have been part of the effort to trace and then require isolation. In Taiwan, you are required to keep your mobile phone showing your location so that if you stray from your home, this will quickly be noted and you will get a warning.The people in these countries are very ready to take measures that keep themselves and each other safer. Hand sanitisers are commonplace. Social distancing is normal. In Hong Kong, more than three quarters of people wear face masks when out in public. It is doubtless true, as British experts say, that these have very little effect in keeping the wearer safe. But in these countries, the majority opinion is that masks reduce the risk of the wearer infecting others. We know that some people have the disease without being aware of it. People there are adopting the precautionary principle.All of these countries have one important advantage over Britain: they were scarred by Sars in 2003. The deaths they suffered spurred their medical services into preparing for another possible coronavirus. Taiwan built up its capacity in intensive care units and stockpiled supplies. With a lively awareness of the danger, Singapore started developing test kits from the moment the new virus became known. Hong Kong quickly decided to restrict travel from mainland China.Deaths from coronavirusThese three territories have all kept their infections in the low hundreds. One might argue that the measures they are taking are fine for those who started being aggressive early but that now it is too late for Britain to learn from them. But the example of South Korea suggests otherwise. It has had one of the biggest outbreaks and currently has 8,565 cases. But it has dramatically slowed the infection rate and adopted similar measures to its neighbouring nations. In South Korea, it has taken the last 17 days for the number of cases to double whereas in the UK it has taken only five.The Koreans learned, too, from a previous virus, and they have the highest rate of testing in the world. They previously set up a fast-track regulatory system for approving testing kits. Those with symptoms go to special clinics, which are separate from the normal hospitals.These countries are not doing rocket science and yet they are avoiding complete lockdown. They are generally doing things we can all think of. They are just doing them very energetically and quickly. And the people of these countries realise the disease is serious. Their cooperation is part of what makes it all work.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

along with pharmacies - that have stayed open during lockdowns. The Government has said that if people must leave their homes to purchase food, they should limit social contact with other people. The Prime Minister has closed bars, clubs, restaurants and theatres from now on.Areas of close social contact such as pubs and clubs are high-risk areas for transmission of the virus. Mr Johnson said: We are strengthening the measures announced on Monday.We need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us.We are collectively telling cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow.We are also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale.I want to stress that we will review the situation each month to see if we can relax these measures.Mr Johnson asked the public not to go out on Friday night, thinking they are invincible.This could become legislation if the Coronavirus Bill is passed through Parliament. Ministers will be able to prohibit or restrict events and gatherings, and to close premises, if the public health situation deems it necessary the notes to the Bill say.The World Health Organization (WHO) has placed quite a hefty emphasis on limiting smaller gatherings to counter the spread of the virus.Dozens of stations on the London Underground network have been closed following the outbreak of Covid-19.Transport for London says the plans were designed to allow critical workers to make essential journeys and will see up to 40 stations which do not interchange with other lines closed on the Tube network.Here is the full list of the closures: Buses in the capital will be reduced and people are being urged not to use public transport for anything other than essential journeys and the Waterloo and City line and Night Tube services will not run from Friday.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: I\u0027m urging Londoners to only use public transport for essential journeys. Everyone should follow this and the other advice to help keep themselves and each other safe.TfL said it would also be gradually reducing the frequency of services across the network from Monday, to provide a service for critical workers to get to where they need to - ensuring that remaining services are not overcrowded.London Overground, TfL Rail, the DLR and London Trams will also be running fewer services from next week.Waterloo - Britain\u0027s busiest station - has looked desolate even during weekday rush hours. Grant Shapps, Secretary of State for Transport, has previously hinted railway services could be axed because there was no point running ghost trains.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced four major financial pledges which will come as a massive relief to many. Government-backed loans worth £330billion - equivalent to 15 percent of GDP - will be made available to support businessesExtending the business rates holiday to all businesses in the hospitality sector and funding grants of up to £25,000 for smaller businessesThree-month mortgage holiday, meaning those affected by coronavirus will not pay a penny towards their mortgageNo business rates for 12 monthsForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has said British citizens are being advised against non-essential foreign travel for 30 days.That refers to anywhere outside the UK.In a Commons statement, he told MPs: Based on the fast-changing international circumstances today I am announcing changes to FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) travel advice.UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lockdowns in various countries.The FCO will always consider the safety and the security of British nationals so with immediate effect I\u0027ve taken the decision to advise British nationals against non-essential travel globally for an initial period of 30 days and of course subject to ongoing review.People classed as vulnerable have been told to drastically change the way they live their lives by social distancing. The Government is strongly advising them to significantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and family if possible.Those who fall into this category are: Underlying health issues can be largely defined by anyone who is instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds, according to the Department of Health.These conditions are set out in the box below.Pregnant women are the most recent group to be added to the list, although the Government has stressed this is purely a precautionary measure as experts are early in our understanding of this virus.Although the limited evidence suggested there were no complications in pregnancy, for many infectious diseases there is a small but appreciable additional risk and as this was a new virus there was no evidence for people in early stages of pregnancy.Infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general and that is why we have taken the very precautionary measure while we try and find out more, the Government\u0027s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said, adding that he would rather be overly cautious at this stage and admit it was overkill at a later date than underplay it and get it wrong.Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce the social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus.Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is pragmatic, the Government said, and the advice is likely to be in place for some weeks.Anybody with coronavirus symptoms - a new, persistent cough or a fever - should self-isolate.Those living alone should do so for seven days, but those living with others should self-isolate as a household for 14 days. Where possible - this should mean not leaving the home at all, and getting groceries delivered to the property.Criminal trials are to be put on hold as part of the ongoing efforts to delay the spread of coronavirus.In a statement, it was announced that the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett - the most senior judge in England and Wales - has decided no new trial should start in any Crown Court unless it is expected to last for three days or fewer.As a result, cases longer than three days that were due to start before the end of April will be postponed.The announcement came after pressure mounted on the Government to make clear its strategy for courts, amid growing concerns about the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on court business.The statement said the impact of the public health emergency on the operation of the courts has been under constant review, and that criminal trials pose particular problems in a fast-moving situation because of the involvement of many participants including the judge, jurors, defendants, lawyers, witnesses and court staff.All cinemas and theatres will close from Friday night.The move comes after theatres in the West End and around the UK closed.The Society Of London Theatre - which represents hundreds of theatres in the capital including the National Theatre, London Palladium and London Coliseum - and UK Theatre said the decision was not taken lightly.The Royal Shakespeare Company also announced its three theatres will close following the Government\u0027s advice.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/15/08/coronavirus-london.jpg","title":"interest rates bank of england coronavirus today latest","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The central bank will also buy £200bn\u0026nbspmore UK assets, restarting its quantitative easing policyThe Bank of England cut interest rates to a new historic low of 0.1 per cent on Thursday amid the UK’s spiralling coronavirus economic crisis.The central bank will also buy £200bn more UK financial assets, restarting its quantitative easing policy, in an bid to calm British bond markets where were “bordering on disorderly”.The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously for the emergency action to support the British economy at a special meeting.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The rates move follows a 0.5 per cent cut\u0026nbspannounced on 12 March by the bank, to coincide with the Budget, which took rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent, the previous record low.The new asset purchases, which will be mainly made up of UK government debt but will also include investment-grade corporate bonds, will take the bank’s stock of assets to £625bn, around 30 per cent of GDP.Government debt – known as gilts – have fallen in price in recent days amid heavy selling by investors. The value of sterling also slumped by some 4 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since the collapse of 1985.In a statement the bank attributed this to investors seeking the safety and liquidity of shorter term debt.“Over recent days, and in common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the UK gilt market have deteriorated as investors have sought shorter-dated instruments that are closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves,” it said.In a conference call with journalists after the decision the bank’s new governor Andrew Bailey said that markets had been “bordering on disorderly”, persuading the bank to restart its asset purchases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rates have never been this low in the more than 300-year history of the Bank of England. Purchases of government and corporate bonds have been ramped up. A desperate measure for a desperate situation,” said Tom Stevenson of Fidelity International.Earlier this week the bank unveiled details of a scheme to buy debt from large distressed companies called the Covid-19 Corporate Financing Facility.Mr Bailey urged struggling companies to seek help from the bank and private lenders rather than shedding staff.Other central banks are also acting in the face of the global economic shock.America’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, has also cut rates to historic lows of 0.25 per cent. On Wednesday the European Central Bank announced a new €750bn government bond-buying operation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Among other options are having a pre-loaded gas or electricity card sent you in the post, or having funds added to your meter credit directly by your supplier.Those in financial distress can request to have debt repayments and bill payments reassessed, paused or reduced if needed.

The crash mirrored the fortunes of traditional markets and came amid\u0026nbspglobal economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.Bitcoin’s recovery saw it return\u0026nbspabove $6,000 on Thursday, having briefly traded as low as $4,000 a few days earlier. Other major cryptocurrencies, including ether, XRP and bitcoin cash, also saw significant price rises as investors returned capital into digital assets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Bitcoin’s crash was a knock-on effect of the stock market collapse, as panicked investors sold any assets they had for cash, so they could pay off urgent debts to their broker,” cryptocurrency expert and author Glen Goodman told\u0026nbspThe Independent.The coronavirus outbreak, which has seen more than 230,000 confirmed cases and close to 10,000 deaths around the world, has caused chaos across global stock markets and seen major currencies like the pound fall to their lowest levels in decades.There has not been an economic downturn of this magnitude since the 2008 financial crisis and some central banks are already considering similarly drastic measures in order to prevent complete collapse.\u0026nbspThe Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank are\u0026nbspreportedly considering emergency monetary policies, including quantitative easing. This would see the banks artificially increase the money supply by essentially printing new money.The finite supply of bitcoin – no more than 21 million will ever exist – has led some investors to consider it a so-called safe-haven asset, similar to gold.“For the longer term, investors are now starting to worry about central banks cranking up the money printing machines,” Mr Goodman said.\u0026nbsp”This could send investors to assets that can’t be endlessly printed, like gold and bitcoin.”Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

It looks outwardly near-identical to the current model, but it offers better value, increased storage and faster performance. But even these things are not the game-changer: that’s the new keyboard.The pricing first: where the previous MacBook Air, on sale until just days ago, cost £1,099 and came with 128GB of internal storage, the entry-level Air is now £100 less, £999, and has 256GB of storage. There’s also a 512GB model available, with a faster processor, for £1,299. There are still lots of laptops out there for much less money, but this price represents good value. Note that Apple has education pricing for those in class as students or teachers, so it’s possible to get that price even lower if you qualify.The look is the same as before: sleek and classy. It comes in three colours, silver, space grey and gold. The space grey is the best: solid and businesslike without looking boring, though the gold, warm with a peachy hint to it, is also a head-turner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe build quality of the MacBook Air is exceptional, an all-aluminium casing that’s sculpted to the slimmest of edges to make it easy to pick up. Like all MacBooks, and unlike many other laptops, you can open it with one hand, the build is so perfectly balanced. Other machines require a finger to hold down the keyboard as you open the lid or the whole thing swings up as it opens.This MacBook Air continues to have a power button with Touch ID built in – a fingerprint scanner that ensures your computer screen locks when you’re away from it and only unlocks to your finger. Apple Watch wearers can also use their smart timepiece to unlock the MacBook Air, which is cool. Both mechanisms feel intimate and secure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The Air has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. For other connections, such as USB-A, you’ll need an adaptor. That’s not always convenient, though it gets easier all the time as more accessories switch to USB-C, and it helps to keep the Air thin.The MacBook Air has been preposterously slim and light since it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2008 when the then-CEO slid it out of an envelope to an admiring crowd. It was so much thinner and lighter than the competition that it drew gasps of excitement. Over the next decade it slipped behind, especially in terms of the screen resolution, though that’s been fixed. Now, the 13in display is bright, rich and superbly high-resolution.Apple releases iPad with 3D scanner and a trackpadApple and Netflix pull out of SXSW over coronavirus fearsAnd then there’s the new keyboard. Apple keyboards were traditionally outstanding, using a scissor-switch mechanism, with lots of travel and a great feel. Then, a few years ago, Apple changed to a whole new system, using a butterfly mechanism. The first-generation of this was quite noisy, but this was overcome in subsequent versions. But then, problems arose which led to keyboards being replaced as users complained that there wasn’t the same reliability.Last year, on the MacBook Pro 16in, Apple introduced the Magic Keyboard – a name taken from its desktop wireless keyboard – which changed everything. The new keys were quieter, more stable and had more travel – a full 1mm. That’s not quite as much as the keys moved before the butterfly landed, when it was 1.2mm. But it was enough, and it was a revelation.It’s the same here. Using the new keyboard subtly transforms the typing experience. It’s not that the butterfly keys were bad: unless they failed, they worked well and were comfortable to use.But as soon as you use the new Magic Keyboard, you recognise how comfortable and inviting it is. The downside is it’s quite hard to go back. Having typed this review on the MacBook Air keys, I picked up a previous Air to make a comparison. As soon as I started typing, my fingers told me I was missing the new experience. The keys on the old Air, which I had used happily before, just couldn’t match the luxurious and satisfying feel of the new one. The gentle scoop on the top of each key that helps your fingers find the right place to touch, the crisper inidual backlighting to make typing in a less bright room a breeze and the clearer lettering on each key – all of which are small, subtle improvements that Apple has made with the Magic Keyboard – add up to something big.The processor has been improved on the latest models with a 1.1GHz dual-core Core i3 processor on the £999 model and a 1.1GHz quad-core Core i5 chip on the £1,299 version.In practical terms, this means that the Air is a real performer. Not that it was a slouch before, but it handles tasks easily. It’s true, the MacBook Pro is still the go-to laptop for those doing advanced video processing or running other power-hungry programs. But the Air is now very fast and effective. To the extent that many customers may ask whether they really need to spend £1,299 on the entry-level 13in MacBook Pro rather than a £999 MacBook Air that isn’t that far off. Sure, there are other extras in the Pro range, like the spiffy Touch Bar instead of function keys, and four Thunderbolt USB-C sockets instead of two on the Air, for instance.Battery life on the MacBook Air is exemplary: it just goes on and on all day where other laptops, including some MacBook Pro models, don’t last as long. It’s so good that you may not even think about checking how much charge is left in the battery. It gives a great feeling of peace of mind.The new MacBook Air is available for order now, with deliveries starting next week. It represents a big step forward for the super-slim Apple laptop, combining sumptuous good looks with real performance and, above all, an unbeatably appealing keyboard.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government needs to protect the right to life and at the same time consider the impact on human rights as it strives to protect the country in this unprecedented time.”The committee said quarantine and self-isolation had an impact on the right to liberty and right to life, while a potential ban on public gatherings affected freedom of assembly and association, and school closures hit the right to education.Restricting people’s ability to work has a “disproportionate impact” on the self-employed and other groups, while the impact on small businesses engages the “right to peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions”.The committee said that any future moves to prioritise or ration healthcare must be “justifiable and non-discriminatory”, and that the prevention of timely funerals could violate freedom of religion.Members said the government must consider the wellbeing of people held in prisons, immigration detention centres and mental health units, as well as the right to\u0026nbspjustice – after new trials of more than three days were stopped.The committee warned that homeless people and those in temporary accommodation will find it difficult to comply with any formal instruction to self-isolate.It called for evidence to be submitted on the steps taken to ensure the government’s plans comply with human rights and to address the impact on groups that will be disproportionately affected by emergency measures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are our families and friends, our colleagues and carers. They must have the right to stay.\u0026nbspEven before the coronavirus crisis, we were warning that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be left without settled status when the Conservative government’s arbitrary deadline hits next year.“That would leave thousands of people effectively undocumented and at risk of eviction, detention and even deportation. It will be a new Windrush scandal on an even bigger scale.”The Home Office figures show that overall, there have been more than 3.34 million applications to the scheme up to the end of February 2020.Minister for future borders and immigration Kevin Foster said: “EU citizens have made huge contributions to our country.

This time, it is different.It will involve the state providing a vast sum. For businesses, support should replicate what business continuity insurance would provide. It should allow workers to continue to be employed. It should offer cash for paying the demonstrated wage bill.Meanwhile, Labour called for state to underwrite up to 90 per cent of wages in return for a guarantee from employers that they will not lay off staff.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Pubs, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, leisure centres and gyms are reportedly set to shut.  Sources close to City Hall say the Government is preparing fresh laws to allow this.Measures include stopping Londoners leaving their homes except to go to the supermarket or pharmacy, The Sun was told.Downing Street said ministers could even use existing laws to keep people in isolation for their own safety.A UK lockdown does look to be inevitable in the near future, as the number of cases and deaths increase.It could mean elderly people being forced by law to stay inside and for people who are under  to travel to only travel to workit cannot be closed “Lockdown” actually isnt a technical term used by public health officials, it is often referred to as “mass quarantines, where residents are forced or advised to stay at home.Although the UK seems to be moving slower than other countries in its response to Covid-, preventative measures have been put in place, with action plans ready to enforcethe situation gets worse.With a major epidemic in the UK expected, the government is exploring ways to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the amount of people affected when the pandemic hits its peak.Englands education secretary will be meeting headteachers to discuss the next step for schools and the government have confirmed ver s will be told to stay home in the coming weeks.Last week, Nicola Sturgeon revealed after a cobra meeting, attended by Boris Johnson, that the UK had moved from the delay to the contain phase as the situation remains to be closely monitored.The government has said that during the delay phase:These steps are being implemented to hopefully, signicantly reduce the number of infections and deaths by up to a third.If the number of cases increase, new measures such as forcing people to stay in quarantine and troops being deployed to support emergency services could be introduced.In addition to this, the UK, along with Japan, the eurozone, Canada, and Switzerland have joined forces with the US Central Bank to prevent coronavirus causing a global recession.Interest rates have been cut to zero and a bn stimulus programme has been launched.  The list of countries on lockdown is rapidly growing as the virus continues to spread at an alarming rate.The majority of the countries in lockdown are in Europe, which is the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.This is as apart from China, alarmingly, Europe has more reported cases and deaths of Covid-, than the rest of the world combined.The full list of all countries on lockdown are as followsOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And you’d also hope they take more care than they did with the actual production, which started to betray a “will-this-do ” attitude with almost its first caption of the night.“Dermot Munaghan.” And the next one: “Colston Smith.” .A foretaste of what was to come, because the event had technically unravelled within the first hour when Lineker had to introduce a comedy sketch about VAR and the  World Cup final.First it appeared, then it vanished. So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid. She volunteered to be, by standing for Labour Party leader.It means noisily backing every woke cause of the day, until their interests collide, as they did spectacularly on last Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain, where Piers Morgan hit her with two innocuous-sounding questions.“Are babies born either male or female ” and “Would you be happyUsain Bolt and Floyd Mayweather self-identied as women, spent a year having testosterone treatment and competed against women ”Correct answers: Yes and no.But Lisa couldn’t say that for fear of offending either the transgender or feminist lobbies.So instead she blathered, lied, evaded, shouted, demanded an apology from Piers , accused him of laughing and describing transgender people as “grotesque”and at one point muttered: “I don’t know what . . . I don’t know what, well, you know, I don’t know what.”Others would’ve let her off the hook at that point, as she was almost crying at her own stupidity by then. Chunk didn’t.To his eternal credit he ignored two ad breaks and kept up the pressure for a spellbinding  minutes that only ended when Nandy offered to settle the issue of whether Floyd Mayweather should be able to box women by “setting up a commission”.To which Piers responded: “It’s not a commission issue, it’s a common sense issue.”But that, as a wise man once said, is the problem with common sense, Piers. It’s not all that common.Ian Wright: “At this stage, I think three points is three points.”Jamie Redknapp: “Switching off from football is always beneficial sometimes.”Piers Morgan effectively ending Lisa Nandy’s Labour leadership bid on TV’s most consistently entertaining show, Good Morning Britain.Saturday night eye balm from BBC’s Ireland: Edge Of The World.

They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating.

after days of shops being stripped bare by Brits grabbing as much stock as they can.The dramatic sweeping measures came as:The PM again refused to rule out shutting pubs and restaurants to try to stop the spread, but made no hint as to whether it was on the way soon.We will do it very much by the science and whether we think the advice given is working, he said.If we feelit isnt working and we need to bring in tougher measures... nothing is ruled out.And he again vowed that a package of vital measures for helping working Brits up and down the country was on the way.Boris said this evening: We are going to look after the people who really suffer, we will be directing our support to them first, the people first.The PM stressed that the first patients had started a randomised trial to try and help cure them of the disease.And he promised to ramp up testing to a whopping , PER DAY in future -

for up to two years.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “We are doing everything we can to protect lives and support the NHS, guided by the best scientists and clinicians in the world.“The new measures we will be introducing in the Emergency Coronavirus Bill this week will only be used when it is absolutely necessary and must be timed to maximise their effectiveness, but crucially they give the government the powers it needs to protect lives.The plans also included:Meanwhile, Downing Street denied that the capital would be put into lockdown - with any restrictions on travel or transport.They said Britain will never see the draconian measures like in France and Italy where people are unable to leave their homes without good reason or paperwork.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: There are no plans to close down the transport network in London and there is zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of London.London was not being shut or cut off, but the Government wants to try and ease pressure on the NHS by enforcing the rules better.But they said new social distancing measures for London were on the cards.This is likely to include forcing pubs, restaurants and cafes to close.Troops are not expected to deployed on the streets to ensure public order, either, the PMs spokesperson stressed.However, Londons transport network is expected to be scaled back in the coming days, and  stations are set to close for the meantime.Schools will shut their doors from Friday and may not re-open until September. Ministers will reveal more about how kids will get their exam grades without sitting tests in the coming days.Heres some more information about what to doyou lose your job due to coronavirus.And here are your rights to sick payyou have to self-isolate.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course not, we dont know where we are, we dont know how long this thing will go on for but what I can say is that this is going to be finite, we will turn the tide and I can see how to do it within the next  weeks.It comes as:It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people undergoing treatment for cancer and others who form part of a group of around . million people will receive specic advice on what to do to keep themselves safe from coronavirus.At present, anyone with an underlying health condition such as those who usually receive an NHS flu jab, people with weakened immune systems and anyone over  is told to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.But those who are at even higher risk of severe illness from Covid-, including recipients of donor organs, those on active chemotherapy or radiotherapy, people with blood cancers and those with severe chest conditions will be given more tailored advice.Mr Hancock told Sky News: The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action. For instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.To receive our Covid- newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Mr Hancock added: These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday. A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.It comes as an army of , retired nurses and doctors have been told “Your NHS Needs You” in the battle against coronavirus.Medical students and trainee nurses are also being invited to join the fight — while members of the public have been askedthey can help, too.The Prime Minister said he expects the tide to be turned in the fight within  weeks, as he urged the public to follow social distancing advice and for businesses to stand by your employees.But he implied that this is onlythe public heeds the social distancing guidance, saying: I know its tough, I know its dficult... but please, please follow the advice.But pictures have shown boozed-up Brits spilling out of clubs and bars in recent days. The PM also said British experts expect to start trials for a vaccine against the virus within a month, although expectations are that a vaccine will take at least a year.Mr Johnson added that a game-changer antibody test was coming down the track which could identy whether somebody somebody had become immune to the disease so they couldto their daily le.He has pledged to massively increase testing to up to , a day, which combined with collective action and scientic progress he said would save many, many thousands of lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last couple of days I’ve woken up feeling like I’d smoked  cigarettes the night before. Yesterday I woke up feeling like I’d smoked  in the last hour. I had an occasional - but not continuous - cough, a headache and aches in my muscles. It was time to self-isolate. I’d already been working from home since Sunday and hadn’t really been out and about much since Friday. Our team started ‘social distancing’ at the end of last week, cutting down the number of staff physically in our office in the Houses of Parliament to the minimum to avoid unnecessary spreading. I’ve worked from home before, so I like to think I know a lot of the tricks. Get dressed. Don’t work in bed - have a desk set up, evenit’s the kitchen table. Have a set beginning and end to your work day. But I didn’t make it past step one yesterday. My partner is - so far - asymptomatic, but has entered isolation with me. We share an extremely small home - welcome to London - so she’s inevitably a couple of days behind me.  Both of us have made a point of not stockpiling. We’ve got enough - ahem - personal items to last a couple of weeks, but that’s about what we keep in anyway. The only things we’ve got more of than usual are ‘quality of le’ things, like a couple of bags of nice coffee beans. Little luxuries that make a couple of weeks stuck in the house feel less like a prison sentence.  Of course, in trying to do the right thing, we’ve ended up without a few things. Nothing dramatic - the biggest problem is that I don’t have a thermometer in the house, so I can’t tellI actually have a temperature. Not sure it matters at this point - my chest feeling like it’s being crushed under a rock is enough evidence for me - but it would have been nice. But a big shout out to the guys on Amazon offering £. thermometers for free delivery in a month’s time - or £you want it this week. Classy. Anyway, I’m settled in. I’m drinking lots of fluids, resting in bed and getting used to the four walls I’ll be looking at for the next week. Symptoms: Coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness, headache, muscle pains. What’s entertaining me: Season  of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine on Netflix.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe biggest, absolutely worst news I have this week is that our wedding has been postponed. It’s due in July and with so many family members coming from around the world, it’s unlikely that it will be able to go ahead. It’s been such a massive decision but last night, I had a voicemail from my sister who lives in Melbourne and who has battled breast cancer alongside me since my recurrence. . She was absolutely devastated on the phone and it broke my heart into a trillion pieces. She has always been pretty pragmatic and solid as as rock and she has always bloody mothered me. so to hear her sobs was just awful. Our wedding for her is massive and we just can’t do it without her. Our beautul venue, Hobbit Hill, is looking at rescheduling all weddings and so we asked about the possibility of changing our date until July  but all summer dates are booked up. Nooooooooo! We’d really wanted to get married in the summer as the venue has so many gorgeous outdoorsy treats. We were going to be married in the outdoor woodland. Buuuut what can we do  We have changed it to th April and all we can do is hope for some lovely April spring. The devil on my shoulder was there straight away telling me I won’t even be alive to see . Ugh, cancer I hate youI don’t know about anyone , but this has really triggered my cancer anxiety again. Homeschooling Ivy and having her so close to me all the time - it makes me frightened that something bad will happen and she’ll have to be without me. She just couldn’t cope. So many emotions at the moment, stress, worry, fear, anxiety, hope, anger, love. Allll the feels. But anyway, wow - absolute meltdown across the globe. We’re witnessing something we’ve never seen in our letime - toilet roll hoarders, greedy capitalist pigs. It’s bringing out the worst in a lot of us. My brother is stuck in Spain - Ryanair have offered to fly him home for an additional £. My friends ran out of her £. baby formula, but it’s okay because someone is selling them on Ebay for £.!!! These guys in Aldi were allowed to fill their trollies with wipes and nappies last week which they then loaded into their van. You guessed it - Aldi nappies and wipes now on sale on Ebay for a disgusting amount. How the hell is this not illegal  It’s children’s necessities FFS. Ebay have been contacted with no reply, Aldi too. They’re just reaping all the profits from our despair. Do you think the staff will be seeing anything extra in their pay-packet  It is not right. And I’m very happy to say that in contrast - there is so much bloody loveliness coming out of the world too. Facebook groups being set up to help neighbours or vulnerable. I’m social distancing because of chemo and this week, so many people have askedwe need help. I’ve had nappies and hand gel and school books for Ivy delivered - even some flower-seeds to spread in the garden with Ivy. I’ve seen people doing shopping for others and free teaching support being offered and meals being left on doorsteps. I absolutely adore this side of the human race.  I’ve been home-schooling Ivy and although I set out to keep it as ‘schooly’ as I could, I’ve found so many fun activities to do that we both actually enjoy Pizza fractions, writing and then learning all the words to her favourite songs, writing stories and drawing together. We’ve learnt to measure out ingredients on the scales, we’ve learnt about Ireland for St Patrickaposs day and we’ve learnt about bees.There’s so much to learn from once you get going! I’ve been looking here for fun learning games and activities www.brightminds and there’s soooo much!  We’ve also bagged ourselves one of these whoopass Roccbox pizza ovens. OMG I cannot wait to give this a go. They’re portable so you can take them to the beach or the park or wherever you find yourself isolating. And the pizzas only take  seconds to cook - maybe it isn’t the end of the world we’re postponing the wedding because my the forecast for my waistline just got a whole lot bigger!

Here, Dr Miriam Stoppard answers your questions on everything from self-isolating to risk groups and future plans... We are told deaths relating to coronavirus are people with underlying health problems. Can you clary what these might be  Brenda Tiley, , from Luton Underlying health problems mean any chronic medical condition such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, lung disease, kidney disease and liver disease. Cancer and cancer treatments like chemotherapy would also make a person vulnerable. These conditions put a strain on the immune system and make the body less resilient, so you should follow all the advice the Government has given us – e.g. self-isolating, not mixing with people, not going out and not travelling.I’m  and have had three heart attacks but feel healthy, should I self-isolate  I also had Asian flu in , will I still have the antibodies from this and will they protect me against Covid-  Frank Robinson, Swinton, Manchester Despite feeling healthy, your three heart attacks put you in the vulnerable group, so you should self-isolate. I wish I could say having Asian flu in  would protect you but I’m afraid it won’t. Each virus is specic and the only thing that would protect us is a specic vaccination for Covid-. My daughter and daughter-in-law are pregnant. Both are going to work from home but are pregnant women more at risk from this virus and are there any precautions they should be taking  Tina Wallman, , Camberley, Surrey Pregnant women are always considered a special group that requires special attention. In this outbreak, that doesn’t change. In fact, the Chief Medical Officer has put pregnant women into the “vulnerable” group, alongside older people and those that have underlying medical conditions. Soyour daughter and daughter-in-law can, I suggest they self-isolate, stay in their homes, do not mix with other people and do not go outdoors unless necessary.  I’m  with underlying health conditions and I play golf regularly. Should I carry on while avoiding physical contact with playing partners, and avoiding the bar and clubhouse  I enjoy the fresh air and exercise. Peter Sidebotham, Stalybridge, Cheshire It’s great that you play golf to keep fit butyou have underlying health conditions I wouldn’t advise you continue to play – there will always be mixing with other people and you’d be exposed to contaminated surfaces. If there’s any way you could play entirely on your own, without any contact with others, it might work. If this isn’t possible you should stop playing golf altogether for the time being. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  I have mental health disorders including depression, as well as underlying physical health conditions. I’m worried I’ll become more depressed, anxious and vulnerableI self-isolate. Should I stop going out because of coronavirus already, and what can I doI do to help my mental health  Name withheld I’m very sympathetic but with your medical background you’d be well advised to self-isolate and put in place some things that could protect you from loneliness. First, I think you should make a resolution to Skype family or friends at least once a day. Phoning a friend a couple of times each day would help as well. Be more active on social media s and engage with your online friends. Make sure you’re eating a healthy diet, not too much coffee, no alcohol – and get a good night’s sleep.  Is delaying the spread the best policy  Won’t it just prolong people’s anxiety  Ian Mussett Delaying the spread is the strategy to take pressure off the NHS. There are downsides and you describe one of them. I don’t think anyone will relax until we hit a peak of some sort. As it happens, it might not be possible to delay the spread. The Government may have acted too late with restrictive measures. To my mind, we should be going further, as they are in France and Spain, with almost total lockdown. It worked in Wuhan and South Korea. Why aren’t we doing it  I’m  with type  diabetes and on insulin. I’ve had an aorta valve change and I’m on blood thinners. I have high blood pressure too. I’m due to look after my granddaughterher school closes but would that be wise  Alan Bebb, Runcorn, Cheshire With all your medical complaints, you’re vulnerable. I think you should be self-isolating, only going out to shop for food or get your medication. I don’t think it is a good idea to look after your granddaughter, she’ll probably be OK but she might carry the virus to you. The latest advice is not to even meet up with your family. My we and I are in our s and she has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We have a holiday booked for June . I have paid a deposit and need to pay the balance in April to keep the holiday. Should I  Graham Newnes, Rutland The NHS has stopped advising coronavirus patients to take ibuprofen amid concerns the anti-inflammatory painkiller could only make things worse. A statement read: There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirusworse. But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you. If you are already taking ibuprofen or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatoryon the advice of a doctor, do not stop taking it without checking first. I don’t think so. The Government’s guidelines say because of your age, you and your we fall into the vulnerable category – especially as she suffers from COPD. This means you should self-isolate, not travel and not mix with other people, like eating out in cafés and restaurants. It’s a shame but I think you’ll have to lose your deposit. I’m  and my we is  and she is susceptible to pneumonia. We’ve recently moved and don’t have any friends or relatives close by. In the case of self-isolating, we’ll have no one to help. What should we do  Roger Baber, Bideford, Devon You could stay in touch by phone, Skype, WhatsApp and social media. By doing this you speak to someone every day. You can also keep your family and friends alert to feeling unwell and they can help you get support. You or your family could phone the local council to seethere’s a service that would do your shopping. I know it’s hard because a lot of us are going to feel bereft in the coming months but we just have to do what we can. What’s the best way to help your immune system cope with the virus  Ray Baguely, , Newport There’s nothing you can do from the outside to boost your immune system. The only way would be to have a vaccination so your immune system produced antibodies specically against coronavirus. Exposure to the virus could stimulate your immune system to produce those antibodies itself.  With over-s spending more time at home, will those without access to a garden be advised to take vitamin D  Linda Rachel, , Ipswich With so little sunshine during the winter, people in the older age group are already advised to take mcg of vitamin D every day in the autumn and winter months. For people confined to their homes it’s even more important to follow this advice. My daughter is in her s and expecting her first baby mid-May. She is terried of there not being a bed available when she goes into labour.

Despite the doom and gloom surrounding the deadly pandemic, more pieces of good news are emerging in the UK and across the world as the fight to stop the virus continues. As of am on Thursday, , people tested positive for Covid- in the UK, and there have been  recorded deaths. And everyone in the UK has now been told to avoid all unnecessary social contact, travel and attending work where possible. But there does appear to be some hope on the horizon... Here are eight feel-good stories that should put a smile on your face. Robots use light beams to zap viruses In China, a robot was used to kill microbes with a zap of ultraviolet light. The incredible test took place in a mock-hospital room, which sees the self-driving machine destroy viruses, bacteria and any other microbes that damage DNA. It uses eight bulbs full of UV-C ultraviolet light, with the machines being distributed across the world - including Europe. Each robot costs , to make, and although it has not yet been proven to kill coronavirus, doctors are confident it will, reports the BBC. It take the robot around  minutes for the robot to clear the room of any viruses. China reports no new cases  On Wednesday, China reported that there have been no new cases of coronavirus for the first time since the outbreak. China has been on lockdown, meaning people can only go outside for food shopping or essential work. Businesses are rewarding NHS staff We cannot thank the NHS staff enough for their hard work during the crisis, and businesses are saying thanks you to them. Companies like Pret, Starbucks, Leon and Dominoaposs are offering the NHS discounts on lunches, hot drinks and even hair cuts just to say a massive thanks too. Air pollution has rapidly dropped As many across the world are working from home and flights being cancelled, the European Space Agencyaposs Copernicus Sentinel-P satellite estimates that the level of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere has declined somewhere between  to  per cent in February. This is compared to previous measurements for the same month in , , and . Responses to future pandemics should improve Coronavirus has been an eye opener in terms of how healthcare systems have responded to the pandemic, so a faster global response, better and quicker distribution of testing kits, and more coordinated and coherent public messaging should be expected the next time around. FIFA tournament involving  teams to help football fans League Two side Leyton Orient are helping fans across the globe who miss the beautul game by organising a -team FIFA tournament. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains.

The news is filled with stories that many of us are finding concerning - and rightly so - and it can feel like everything is a bit gloomy at the moment. But at times like these itaposs important to look for the good things to keep our spirits up, and there has been no shortage of kindness, generosity and hilarity. The UK is coming together to fight back against the deadly disease, looking out for their loved ones, neighbours and complete strangers to make sure they are safe and well. Weaposve had a look at some of the amazing things that have hit the headlines in the last few days. Have you seen an incredible act of kindness  Email webfeatures@trinitymirror. Checking on neighbours Apart from the odd polite hello or awkward small talk when you pick up a parcel, most of us donapost really have much to do with our neighbours. But as soon as people were asked to start self-isolating, residents were reaching out to check people nearby were okay. Kind-hearted folk put notes through doors offering to bring them food shopping or askingthey needed help with anything.  Many have also offered to start regularly calling their neighbours who are unable to go out so they have someone to talk to. Among them was Becky Wass, from Falmouth, Cornwall, who made a print at home template which allows people to tick boxes outlining what help they require.  Children have also been making their parents proud by looking out for elderly people in their area. Seven-year-old Jimmy-Dean Hudson, from Westclfe, Essex, has been out buying toilet roll for people using his pocket money. He then packed it all on to a festival trolley and started making deliveries.  His mum Tracy said: One elderly man in his s was telling us how worried he was and how in the war they didnapost have this panic buying and communities pulled together to help and not be greedy. Iaposm super, super proud of him, and he really has put smiles on many faces. aposaposAll of his family, friends and school teachers are so proud of his kindness. Well-deserved appreciation for our NHS Doctors, nurses, porters, hospital front of house staff and other NHS workers have been putting themselves at risk every single day by going into to work to treat people with coronavirus. Many have taken on extra shts as they do everything they can to treat the symptoms and reassure patients.  In many cases, this has meant theyaposre not able to spend time with their loved ones as theyaposre in an aposat riskapos group. People have taken to social media to thank NHS and other medical stuff for getting up and going to work at this horrible time. Pret, McDonaldaposs and other places are giving all NHS staff free drinks, while some supermarkets are letting them in an hour early so they can get what they need and avoid queues before they go to work. And for supermarket workers, chemists and other aposvitalapos workers Other aposvital workersapos who never normally get recognition or thanks are being appreciated now. Supermarket staff, food delivery drivers, chemists and people who work at factories producing things we need every day have continued going to work while the rest of us stay home.  Just like NHS staff, they have risked getting ill themselves to ensure we have the things we need. There have been many upsetting reports of people being rude to supermarket staff in particular when customers are frustrated by the empty shelves, but the majority of people have been thanking them for going in. The internet being funny While this is obviously an extremely serious issue, itaposs important to have a bit of light relief during dficult and uncertain times. And of course the internet has out done itself. There are countless memes, videos and photos of people adjusting to self-isolating, working from home and social distancing, and they can be the perfect pick-me-up from the worry most of us are currently having. Shopping locally Many small businesses face an uncertain future, especially those in the hospitality sector, as people are asked to stay indoors and not socialise. This has resulted in many people making more of an effort to shop locally to support independent businesses.  Rather than going to supermarkets, many of which have empty shelves, shoppers have been walking down to their local butchers or greengrocers to get fresh produce for dinner. Many independent food shops have also been putting together packages and delivering them to people who are stuck indoors in their area. Catching up with friends Ironically, many of us are actually making more of an effort to chat to our friends since being told weaposre not allowed to see them. Group video call apps have becoming hugely popular as we all catch up with pals.  People have been getting in touch with people they havenapost seen in weeks and enjoying a meal or a glass of wine thanks to the wonders of technology. These penguins got to go on a cute date After the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago closed its doors due to coronavirus, staff decided to let Wellington, Edward and Annie go for a little wander to meet some of the other animals.  Their humans shared photos and videos from their outing on social media, and followers absolutely loved it. The first post, showed Wellington visiting some tropical fish tanks. They said: Penguins in the Amazon ! Some of the penguins went on a field trip to meet other animals at Shedd.  Wellington seemed most interested in the fishes in Amazon Rising! The black-barred silver dollars also seemed interested in their unusual visitor. They followed this up with a clip of bonded pair, Edward and Annie on what people couldnapost help but call a cute date. The adventure continues, they wrote. This morning, Edward and Annie explored Shedd’s rotunda.  They are a bonded pair of rockhopper penguins, which means they are together for nesting season. Springtime is nesting season for penguins at Shedd, and this year is no dferent! The environment People staying indoors has had an extremely positive impact on the environment.

The Duchess wore a pink trouser suit with a white top for the visit. Prince William thanked the team on behalf of his grandmother the Queen and dad Prince Charles. He said: The last few weeks, and more recent days have been understandably concerning with the continuing spread of coronavirus. “It’s at times like this when we realise just how much the NHS represents the very best of our country and society – people from all backgrounds and walks of le with dferent experiences and skills, pulling together for the common good.  “Not only are NHS staff and emergency workers responding to the needs of the public, they – like the rest of us – are concerned about their families, friends and loved ones. “They need our support as much as we need theirs. Passing on thanks on behalf of the royal family, William daid: “That is why Catherine and I were proud to visit staff working at NHS , to pass on our personal thanks, along with those of my grandmother and father, to staff working around the clock to provide care and advice to those that need it most.  “It was also brilliant to see the great online tools for those with mild symptoms or worries. “All of us have a part to playwe’re going to protect the most vulnerable. “That means acting on the latest expert advice, staying homewe or those we live with have symptoms, and avoiding non-essential contact to help reduce the spread of the virus. At the moment the  service - which in London is run by the ambulance service - is dealing with about , calls a day across the capital.  Normally that figure would be about ,. More than % of calls are normally answered within  seconds but the unprecedented pressure on the service means most people are holding on for more than an hour. While the couple sanitised their hands twice during the visit, one member of staff forgot the new rules when she asked William and Kate for a photograph and without thinking reached out to shake their hands. “Don’t shake hands!” William remonstrated with a laugh as he brought down his other hand to cut her off.  But he swtly added as they posed for a picture: “We can do a photographwe are not within a metre of each other.” Dr Agatha Nortley-Meshe, a GP and the assistant medical director of the London Ambulance Service, told the couple the call centre had a multi-disciplinary team with GPs, pharmacists, nurses and paramedics who were working “extremely hard”.

Ingé Kirsten, from Newcastle, posted harrowing video showing her coughing while hooked up to a ventilator with a mask over her face in hospital. In another clip, the -year-old, who has a heart condition, repeatedly coughs and struggles to breathe as she begs people to self-isolate and follow social distancing guidelines. She hit out at those who are ignoring the governmentaposs Covid- advice, telling : I think it’s really bad. I don’t think people have realised how serious it is. Iaposm sure no one would want themselves or their loved ones in this position or worse. Have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror. Why aren’t pubs or bars realising the impact that they are having by staying open  Why would people put their lives and others at risk  It’s bizarre to me. I think people think they’re immune to it. No one is. It’s doesn’t discriminate who it takes hold of. “And I understand people are scared and panicking buying but not sparing a thought for other is awful. I’m glad I can’t leave my house to witness it first hand. People have been leaving care packages at my door for me.I’ve seen so many lovely posts of people helping others, older people, with care packages. I shared my story as I was sick of people not taking it seriously and still putting themselves or others at risk. Hopefully they’ll be a bit more mindful now. Ingé, who works in a call centre, said doctors told her that she is likely suffering from coronavirus. She was sent home without being tested and told to stay away from others. Her -year-old daughter, Macey, and her cousin have been ordered to self-isolate away from her due to potential exposure to Covid- Ingé said: It started last Thursday, I think. The day after my birthday. I didn’t do anything on my birthday as I’ve just moved into my new house. But I slept for almost  hours and just generally felt really unwell.Then sat I started to get a sore throat and losing my voice. By Sunday afternoon I could barely breathe for coughing. I had to call  again last night and they sent an ambulance pretty quick as I couldn’t breathe for coughing. They ran some tests for blood pressure, temperature, etc but as it wasn’t bad enough to be admitted they’ve told me to carry on as I am isolating at home with the steroids and paracetamol.  Ingé desperately misses her daughter and has been trying to cope with loneliness while self-isolating. She said: It is really hard being away from Macey. She came to hospital with me and my cousin and the doctor told her to take my daughter home to her house as she cannot be around me for  days. So she’s currently at my cousinaposs home. We’ve been FaceTiming but she’s only  and missing being with me a lot.  In one of her videos, Ingé coughs repeatedly and struggles to breathe. She wheezes with every breath and holds her hand to her chest as she coughs in pain. She tells the camera: I just wanted to make a video of how bad it actually is because I know a lot of people out there donapost really believe that itaposs a serious virus or anything like that. This is me breathing. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Itaposs absolutely horrendous so any advice to those who donapost believe it or arenapost taking any safety precautions, seriously do. None of this is worth your health. In a post, she wrote: I realise that this is all a very worrying time and some people are not that concerned. I didn’t want to share my experience so publicly however people should know that this virus disease is no laughing matter. It began last week without me even realising I may have been infected. Thursday I slept for almost  hours, Saturday I started with a sore throat and began to lose my voice. For those concerned they have coronavirus in the UK, Public Health England has issued advice about how to self-isolate. . Stay at home: Donapost leave your house except when you need to seek medical care. Ask for help buying groceries or have them delivered.. Stat away from your housemates: Stick in a well-ventilated room away from others, with the door closed. Use a separate bathroom and wear a facemask when it shared areas..

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email The Government has announced a full shutdown of all schools with the exception of children of key workers as of tomorrow amid the coronavirus pandemic.This announcement came as the Education Secretary said people will be able to go to college and university without having sat GCSE or A-level exams. Gavin Williamson reiterated last nightaposs announcement that no exams will take place this academic year, before the summer term. Askedhe anticipated people still going into higher and further education without undergoing a formal exams process he told Sky: Yes, thataposs right. He added further guidance about how to do this will be published on Friday and talks with school leaders are still ongoing. The Education Secretary said there will have to be an appeals process for any pupil who feels theyaposve been wronged. The Mirror understands it is possible universities could use predicted grades,they resume as normal in September, but this is not confirmed. But what will the schools closure mean for children, parents and families Here is everything we know so far, as reported by Bristol Live.  What schools are involved  The Prime Minister made it clear that all schools would be involved in the shutdown across England, following announcements in Scotland and Wales. Mr Johnson also said that he would be aposexpectingapos childrenaposs nurseries, pre-schools, sixth-forms and colleges to also close their doors.  How long will the shutdown be for  The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that schools will shut their gates at the end of Friday and then be shut indefinitely - the Government are careful not to put a time frame or date on when they may reopen. When asked by journalists at the Number  briefing that happened simultaneously, Mr Johnson appeared to rebuff the suggestion, made in Wales and Ireland, that the school closures could be for as long as six months - that Friday would effectively mark the end of the school year, and the summer term after Easter would simply not happen, with schools reopening in September. He said he would hope that schools could reopen before then, but with the coronavirus pandemic rapidly spreading throughout Britain, there is no certainty at all on when they would reopen.  Who will still go to school  The Education Secretary said that schools would remain open for the children of keyworkers, to ensure that people who the country needs to continue to go to work and not worry about childcare, will be able to do so. The Prime Minister said these would be the children of NHS workers, police and emergency services personnel and aposdelivery driversapos who are critical to ensuring the continuing working of the food supply from farm to factory to shops. The Prime Minister said exactly who would be in this list would be revealed this week, before Friday - but there are no firm details as yet, on Wednesday evening.   What about grandparents  There was a specic warning from the Prime Minister that, under no circumstances, children should be now looked after by their grandparents, once they are home from school. That generation of older people are the most vulnerable to coronavirus, and the message from the scientists is that young people and the elderly should be kept apart to avoid older people catching the virus.  What should parents do  One of the key reasons why schools are now being closed is to further ensure that a partial lockdown of society happens. Parents are being asked to look after their children at home, and not leave them with grandparents, and this move is designed to increase the numbers of people who largely withdraw and remain in their homes, to stop the further spread.Most controversially, however, Boris Johnson again held back from making lockdowns and closures of businesses an order - even though all other countries in Europe are pursuing those more severe measures.  What about exams  The Prime Minister confirmed that, given schools will be closed for a considerable time and exams start in May, this yearaposs  GCSEs and A-levels would be scrapped. This does mean that exams will not take place in May and June as planned, but we will make sure that students get the exams they need and deserve, said Mr Johnson. Quite how that happens is unclear, but the most likely explanation will be some kind of grade awarded from coursework already completed, or predictive grades or grades from mock exams.  What about vulnerable children  School children who are classed as vulnerable will be still be allowed to go to school - this includes children who have an EHCP - children with special needs - and children who have a social worker or are in care.  What about Free School Meals  The Prime Minister outlined that they would be rapidly drawing up plans for a voucher scheme for children who are entitled to free school meals - but who will now not be at school to receive it each day - to get that food or support. The details of how exactly this works are yet to be revealed.

Her plea comes as chaotic scenes across the country have seen supermarket shelves stripped bare, despite continued insistence from both the government and supermarket bosses that there is enough food. In a heartbreaking video, Dawn Bilbrough, , from York, asks people to just stop taking more food than needed, warning the public itaposs key workers who will be looking after you when youaposre at your lowest. She admits she had a little cry in the supermarket after seeing the fruit and vegetable shelves totally bare. I donapost know how Iaposm supposed to stay healthy. And those people... people are  just stripping the shelves of basic foods. You just need to stop it. Because itaposs people like me that are going to be looking after you when youaposre at your lowest so just stop it. Please!  GMBaposs Susanna Reid said her heart absolutely broke when she heard Dawnaposs emotional plea. A desperate paramedic who had been out saving lives at work was also pictured staring at empty shelves in a Sainsburyaposs.Supermarkets have introduced tighter restrictions on opening hours and item limits in order to tackle the issue.  Tesco, Sainsburyaposs, Asda and Morrisons have been decimated of essential items such as toilet roll, handwash and pasta. Fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, and bread stocks have also been severely raided.There were also violent scenes at an Iceland store in Ilford, east London, earlier this week after an elderly shopper was pushed and shoved out of a packed Iceland store. Customers were seen queuing outside an Aldi even before the doors opened this morning, with most people heading to the loo rolls section straight away - even though the Government has told Britons not to panic buy. Major supermarkets including Sainsburyaposs, Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons have rationed how much of certain products customers can buy. Some stores had scenes of “bedlam” and were stripped bare within  minutes, while staff were abused over queue s and limits on purchases. There were even reports of fights between shoppers and attacks on workers. And some inconsiderate hoarders crashed early-morning slots reserved for the elderly and vulnerable to visit and grab vital supplies.  One social media user said: “I was in a store last night and the shelves were bare. The locusts had descended.” Posting a picture of full shelves yesterday morning, they added: “Your night sht shelf-stackers are heroes.” David Williams of shopworkers’ union Usdaw said: “Shopworkers are on the front line. There are incidents of mass scrabbling when stuff goes on to the shelves. People are working out when the lorries arrive at the stores and are waiting for the products to come out.” In Manchester, -year-old pensioner Marilyn Lundy said she had to leave a branch of Sainsburyaposs empty handed after she found the shelves empty and urged aposgreedyapos shoppers to think twice before filling their trolleys. Kath Blayden, , was looking for paracetamol, long-le milk, loo rolls and tinned pineapple. Staring at the empty painkiller shelf, she said: “I have never seen anything like this. People are being greedy and I think this will only get worse. There’s enough to go aroundthey weren’t so selfish.” At Tesco, Marion Koppel, , said: “I’m trying to do my normal shopping but people are panic buying so much they are making it impossible. “I don’t know what has got into everyone – please just calm down.” Kathryn Hopkins, , from Doncaster said: “Some stores are opening early for pensioners but in our region their free bus pass is not valid until after .am.” The carer said she had tried to do a shop on Wednesday but failed – despite visiting three stores before am.  She said: “It must be a terrible shock to older people who turn up and the shelves are empty. A lot of the basics are nowhere to be seen.” Retired teacher Lesley Thornton said she nearly wept when she saw a couple in their s only manage to get a bag of hotdog buns at a Sainsbury’s in North East London.  The -year-old said: “It was bedlam and makes me feel so frustrated. It was so shocking how empty the store was. The whole frozen section was gone. But I saw kind gestures too, with people handing over goods they’d got to others who were looking for it.” Several supermarket chains have restricted purchases in-demand items like toilet roll, paracetemol and pasta, while others have brought in blanket bans on multiple purchases. Itaposs just one of a number of measures brought in by the nationaposs grocers, as pictures of empty shelves spread through social media like wildfire. Panic buyers have stripped shelves of everything they can - in some cases leaving just ice cream and chocolate Easter eggs - while huge queues snaked around some supermarkets ahead of opening on Wednesday. Currently there are no official limits coming down from the Government, although pressure is growing to impose them, and supermarket bosses insist there is no shortage - simply people over-buying.In the interim, the shops have taken action themselves - limiting customer purchases and opening hours. Competition laws will be temporarily relaxed to allow supermarkets to collaborate in feeding the nation during the coronavirus crisis. Retailers will be able to pool staff, share data on stock levels, and share distribution depots and delivery vans as the Government seeks to ease restrictions under the exceptional circumstances. The temporary relaxation only permits retailers to work together for the sole purpose of feeding the nation as they face a strain from intense demand amid panic buying, ministers said.  The p plastic bag charge will also be waived for online purchases to hasten deliveries, and driversapos hours will be relaxed so more food can be delivered to stores.

We have an idea to honour Betty and her family by lining the road from the church in Buailtín to the cemetery. This is an opportunity for us as a community to pay our respects and show our support for Betty’s lovely family. Making sure to all remain  metres apart!

Alexandra Howarth-Hynes killed herself after taking cocaine and drinking alcohol on a night in with a friend. On October  last year Miss Howarth-Hynes was found hanged at her home in Oldham after spending the night in with a friend. It emerged during the inquest at Rochdale Coroners Court that Miss Howarth-Hynes, , had started drinking at around .pm and told her fiance Gavin Gayle “that she was going to have a couple of glasses of wine”. Mr Gayle left to go to work his night sht and throughout the evening the pair exchanged messages in which they spoke about money and discussed their upcoming wedding. During this time, a friend came over and Miss Howarth-Hynes drank vodka while they chatted.  In written evidence, the inquest heard that Miss Howarth-Hynes, who had been friends with Kirsty Shedlock for nearly  years, discussed “everything and everyone including the children” over the course of the evening. “She said sometimes she would be okay but sometimes had worried thoughts in her head, the inquest heard. “Alex had some cocaine that night but I do not know how much she had. “At no point did she mention wanting to take her own le.” Ms Shedlock left the property at .am and the pair embraced in a hug. Miss Howarth-Hynes texted her friend just  minutes later to say “thank you for letting me have an offload” and that she was going to bed.At around am she exchanged another message with her fiance on Facebook. But Mr Gayle started to worry about her welfare when he texted her to say “I love you” and she replied, “I love you and the kids”. The inquest heard that he became “concerned that she did not say that the kids and you were her world, which was a little bit out of character. That worried him,” said assistant coroner, Michael Salt who read out evidence. Mr Gayle alerted Miss Howarth-Hynes’ mother, Debra, who went to the house and found her daughter. Paramedics were called but Miss Howarth-Hynes was pronounced dead at the scene. The inquest heard that family members “did think that Alex did intend to take her own le one day. They felt that one day it was likely to happen. It emerged during the inquest that Miss Howarth-Hynes had a history of mental health problems, including self harm, anxiety and depression, which started with the bereavement of a family member in . In May , written evidence from her GP, Dr Thompson, said that “she described feeling a lot better and more positive, but later described her mood as ‘up and down’.” She was referred to an Oldham-based mental health service, Healthy Minds, run by the Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust. In September , Miss Howarth-Hynes completed a Patient Health Questionnaire over the telephone, which asks patients to rate how often they have been experiencing certain behaviours associated with mental health disorders. She told the assessor that she had been experiencing suicidal thoughts “nearly every day” and “scored a three” which is the highest risk. She agreed to speak to family or friends, or ring an ambulanceher thoughts continued or escalated. The next morning she was seen by Tracy Shaw, a trainee psychological wellbeing practitioner, and was given the same questionnaire where this time “she scored a zero”.

But as most of the world goes through periods of isolation and shutdown, we take a look at how other countries have handled widespread closures. The virus had its first recorded cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan toward the end of last year, which saw officials put the area on lockdown in January to help stop the spread. Although this was greeted with astonishment, it looks to have gradually proven successful - now there are some fears of a apossecond waveapos once le s to normal and people begin mixing again. But authorities in China now say there has been no record of new infections of Covid- in the virus epicentre or in the surrounding Hubei province, for the first time since the outbreak began. In the UK, itaposs believed tens of thousands of people are infected, with the death toll now standing at .  Prime Minister Boris Johnson most recently announced the closure of schools from Monday and the cancellation of exams.Transport for Londonannounced up to  underground stations would now be closed, with a reduced service running from Friday, and night tubes axed.London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned Londoners they should not be travelling unless they “really, really have to”, but insisted the network must remain open to aid frontline health workers.Although Boris Johnson advised members of the public to avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants and theatres, chatter on social media says some residents in the capital are still heading out as they usually would. But could the government impose a lockdown soon, whether it be London or the rest of the nation  And what could it look like  Also, what does a lockdown really mean  While new stringent measures by the government are being revealed almost daily to help tackle the outbreak, Mr Johnson has warned they wonapost hesitate to introduce tougher action to protect peopleaposs health when necessary. In his daily press conference, he said: Weaposve always said that we are going to do the right measures at the right time. We live in a land of liberty, we don’t tend to impose those sort of restriction. But I have to tell you: we will rule nothing out. We will bring forward further and faster measures where necessary. He added: I think a lot of people are making a real heroic effort to comply with the advice that we have given but as I’ve said tonight and in the past few days we keep everything under continuous review and we will not hesitate to bring forward further and faster measures where we think that is necessary. Ending his conference by reiterating more measures were on the table, he said: It would be quite wrong to do so…we do not rule out taking further and faster measures in due course.”  Italy was the first to head into lockdown as it became the worst affected country in the region, with now more than , confirmed cases and nearly , deaths. On March , the Italian government shut down the northern areas which were worst hit, but just two days later, the control was extended over the rest of the country with measures in place until April . Under the rules, residents are only allowed to travel unless urgent, veriable work situations and emergencies or health reasons. This means employers have been urged to put their staff on leave to avoid work-related travelthey cannot work from home. Schools and universities shut down, with exams cancelled, however religious institutions have stayed open as long as people stay one metre away from one another.  All sports venues, museums, and venues such as cinemas and clubs have been closed, as gatherings have been banned, while only supermarkets and pharmacies remain open. Those diagnosed are not allowed to leave their homes at all, and those suffering from symptoms are encouraged to stay at home also. Comments on social media show residents are taking precautions very seriously, with video footage being widely shared of people singing together and joining in with group workouts, but from safe distances on their inidual balconies. in France their lockdown in began from noon on Tuesday for  days.We are at war, a public health war,” President Emmanuel Macron said in an address on Monday as he declared the nationwide lockdown to fight the virus that has infected more than , people in the country and killed . As reported by local media outlet France , travel to work is allowed as long as the work is essential and cannot be done from home, shopping for groceries and brief outings for exercise is accepted, along with health-related appointments such as heading to the pharmacy. Residents are also allowed to leave their houses for imperative family reasons, such as looking after children and the elderly. However when leaving their homes, they must carry a document certying why they have left the house and failure to do so will result in a fine. Some , police and guards are currently patrolling the region to enforce the lockdown. France had already closed down its restaurants and bars from Saturday, and schools and universities closed on Monday. Spain has been in an official state of emergency since last Friday and therefore declared a nationwide lockdown by closing all businesses except for essential services, such as pharmacies and supermarkets, in an effort to curb the spread of COIVD-.

Speaking after completing a night sht, exhausted Mr McAinsh, who works at the Gavazzeni Hospital in Bergamo, which is only treating Covid- patients, said an endless stream of people has been arriving. As soon as one patient dies and is removed from the ward, they are immediately replaced with another one fighting for their le, he said, and burials are happening every  minutes in a local cemetery. Have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror. Italy is now the worst-hit country after its death toll surpassed that of China, hitting , with more than , confirmed cases amid a nationwide lockdown. Mr McAnish told ITV News: The rate of deaths going up so high, as soon as there was a death or that we could transfer a patient from our hospital to one of the first hospitals that was taking people with infectious diseases because they had wards for that, immediately we would take in new patients. It’s just an endless stream of people coming in and as soon as we have a bed, we have a new patient coming in who needs critical care.  So it’s much less personal, there’s less of a one to one relationship with our patients now, they’ve just become, you know, numbers. Recent photos and video have shown distressing scenes in Italyaposs hospitals, with critically ill patients hooked up to machines that are keeping them alive. At the main hospital in Bergamo, footage shows patients on the apocalypse ward wearing plastic bubble helmets and gasping for air.  Medics in hazmat suits dash from patient to patient to offer help as the bubbles equalise the air pressure in the lungs. Mr McAnish said the hospital has set up a tent for the dead and there are burials every  minutes in a local cemetery. The victimsapos families are not there when they are laid to rest, and the last time they see them alive is usually when they are collected at home by ambulance, he added. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Mr McAnish has warned British medics to take the coronavirus threat seriously. Italy wasnapost ready for the pandemic, he added. The president of Lombardy said the government had agreed to deploy the army in his region to enforce the lockdown against the coronavirus epidemic, which is not slowing down. For those concerned they have coronavirus in the UK, Public Health England has issued advice about how to self-isolate. .

Desperate toto Britain, grandparents Kaye and Margaret Larbi could remain stranded in the locked-down capital of Quito for several more days or even longer after planes were grounded. Theyaposve had no luck contacting staff from Britainaposs embassy in Ecuador and havenapost been able to get answers from airline KLM as up to a million Britons are trapped abroad due to the crisis. Speaking from a hostel where other Britons are staying, Mr Larbi, from Ilford, north-east London, told : In some respects we’re probably better off here than in England. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. We’re not short of food, there’s tons of lavatory paper. It’s just that the place is very quiet and there’s not an awful lot to do apart from read, but at least we can go into a garden [at the hostel] and the climate is sunny and warm. Mr Larbi suffers from hypertension - which makes him more vulnerable to coronavirus - and he is running out of medication. He said: I take three tablets and there are two that I can buy here. It’s not le or death, I can get by on the two.  The retired couple - Mr Larbi aged  and Mrs Larbi aged  - booked their trip in December when the new strain of potentially deadly coronavirus, known as Covid-, hadnapost yet emerged. They left London on March  and were due toon Thursday, but KLM had to cancel the flight, leaving them stranded. Hundreds of Britons are trapped in neighbouring Peru and begging the Foreign Office to send a plane to rescue them after being told they could be forced to pay more than £, to get home. Israel sent four planes to Lima to repatriate its citizens free of charge.    A Manchester woman in Lima wrote online that one airline was charging more than £, for a one-way ticket to Europe. The Foreign Office had earlier warned that Britons may be stuck in other countries during the crisis as airlines cancel flights, airports close and countries close their borders. For the Larbis, they began their trip in Quito and then moved on to Cuenca last Saturday. Mr Larbi said: When we went around the streets on the Sunday we were taken aback to see that the churches had closed and there were notices saying people could follow the mass on the radio. That was a but disconcerting. There was no sign of other measures. On the Monday we went to some thermal baths and on the way the taxi driver said he had heard that there was going to be a lockdown. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. So we got him to turn around and take us to the bus terminal where he contacted officials from the bus companies. They did suspect that the government was going to order a shutdown. Taking drastic action, Ecuador closed its ports and banned all flights from Sunday to stop the spread of Covid-.  Mr Larbi said the couple watched President Lenín Morenoaposs announcement on the measures, adding: At that stage we knew the game was up, so we packed up and took our bags and caught the last bus to Quito on Monday night. It was a citizen lockdown. At their hostel in Quito, the couple have been trying to contact KLM and the UK Government to find outthey can offer any kind of assistance.  KLM told the couple to book a new flight, but that proved fruitless, they said. Mr Larbi said: We called and called and called the British embassy but could not get through at all, there’s only one line. I went to the embassy on the other side of town - itaposs not easy to get to [during the lockdown] and on their door there was a piece of paper saying staff are working remotely due to the pandemic and one should call a certain number - the same number we had called from the hostel. Outside the embassy, he met other Britons in the same predicament. Mr Larbi said: One said they had managed to contact the embassy through the phone and their advice was worse than useless - contact the travel insurers or airline.  Since the th we’ve been going on the KLM app sending messages - we’ve got nothing. Yesterday we tried the embassy again. We asked the hostelaposs receptionist to call and the line was out of order. At that point we gave up. They have contacted their MP, Wes Streeting, for help. Itaposs not all bad, however. Mr Larbi said: The weather is beautul, the hostel is great, it’s got a lovely garden. UK citizens have been told not to travel anywhere in the world for at least the next  days. The Government has changed its advice to ban all non-essential travel as it attempts to clampdown on the spread of the coronavirus. If your journey has been cancelled, check the terms and conditions of your booking or travel insurance to see what the small print says. If you have a package holiday booked and part or all of it is cancelled by the organiser airline, you must be offered a refund within  days. Some organisers are offering alternative holidays or allowing consumers to reschedule but this is not a legal remedy. If you booked a flight separately that has now been cancelled, the following rules apply:If your flight was due to depart from the United Kingdom, European Union, Iceland, Norway or Switzerland or was due to arrive in one of these countries via a UK EU airline, you should be offered a choice of three alternatives. If it was a non-EU flight, you will need to check the terms and conditions for the airline.If the FCO advises against all but essential travel to your destination and youaposre flying out from a UK airport, or ing to one, and your flight is cancelled, youaposll be entitled to a refund under a European Union regulation, called EC. Your airline will inform youthis happens, and in some cases you may be able to negotiate to postpone your flight to later in the year. Weaposve got a full guide on your coronavirus travel and refund rights, here. For coronavirus advice on school closures, sick pay, working from home and holiday or event cancellations, click here. But weaposd like to get home because we’ve got all sorts of responsibilities. People are looking after our home and our cats. As far as we know there arenapost any flights out. We’ve just got to fill in our time as best as we’re able to until we can leave. If we can we are going to go out for a walk, but I don’t think the authorities really like people walking around. There are adverts on the TV telling people to stay home.

We’re just taking it day by day, trying to maintain fitness and looking after ourselves as best we can.“It’s a really hard situation to explain. It doesn’t feel real.“We’ve just been told football’s now stopped and we don’t know when we’ll be playing again.“Everything’s just been shut down all of a sudden and it’s a really weird feeling. It’s not really sunk in yet.”Dundee have gone six matches unbeaten, with five consecutive clean sheets, and sit third in the table.The Dens men are just four points behind second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle, who they were due to play this weekend before the cancellations.Forster said: “The season as a whole hasn’t been good enough for us but the way things were going recently, it was starting to look positive for us with regard to hitting form in the lead-up to the play-offs.“There was a real bit of optimism building and it’s frustrating that that momentum has just been stopped with no indication of when we’re going to be able to play again, andwe are going to be able to play again this season at all.“I’m a big believer that whatever is going to be will be. You can only worry about things you can control # and this situation is definitely out with our control.”The loan signing of Scotland international Christophe Berra from Hearts has made a huge dference.Berra, , was bombed out by Daniel Stendel after the former Barnsley manager’s Tynecastle appointment in December.Forster said: “Big Christophe has done well for us. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s played at a high level so it’s good for defenders like myself to play alongside him.“You can learn loads from a guy like that. We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally. I take a lot of pride in my performance and I feel like over the past couple of years I’ve found a way of managing my body that works well.“I don’t think I’ve missed a game through injury for two years now so long may it continue.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d8491bc586106.30631675-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee pupils left shocked by exam cancellations","story":"Dundee pupils have been left shocked after it was announced exams will be cancelled for the first time in Scottish history.The SQA has decided to cancel the exams in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has spread across the UK rapidly in the past week.There are now more than , cases of the virus in the UK, with more than  in Scotland.Education Secretary John Swinney made the #unprecedented# announcement in Holyrood yesterday.This morning the sentiment among many pupils was that their hard work this year had potentially been for nothing.Dylan McLaren, a sixth-year pupil at Grove Academy, said: #It#s just really unfortunate, schools getting closed down and exams being cancelled.#I#ve been really lucky because I#ve got un-conditionals but it#s still pretty disappointing because I#ve worked really hard and it all seems to be for nothingthey use our prelim results and that#s final.#The people I feel for most are those who have to meet conditionals and now won#t.#Another Grove pupil, who did not wish to be named, added: #I guess it#s pretty disappointing butit#s been deemed necessary then that#s that.#We#re just going to have to deal with it.#Rosie Dignan, a -year-old pupil at Harris Academy, said: #It#s very shocking, like a month ago none of us were worried and now what the whole school year was leading up to has been cancelled.#I feel really bad for people who have conditionals because prelims are never a realistic portrayal of your results, we do them halfway through the course.#Mr Swinney told ministers that the decision underlined the gravity of the ongoing crisis, as the exams had even taken place during both world wars.He said: #In all of our history Scotland has never cancelled the exams.

But, at the same time, I also completely disagree.While our minds are being blown with stress and mild panic about being shut in our homes and where we’re going to locate our next roll of toilet paper, we all desperately need a release to think about something .Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + and the rest will be doing a roaring trade right now as people figure out what to fill spare time with.It’s exactly the same for football debate – there’s no games but that doesn’t stop the debate, thankfully.Doesn’t make le easy for a football writer, mind you . . .Nor is it easy for the likes of Ian Maxwell and Neil Doncaster as they attempt to navigate the minefield that is now our game.The big clubs haven’t wasted any time in applying pressure for what they want to see – Celtic want to be awarded the title, Rangers obviously disagree and Hearts don’t want to be relegated.I have to say, apart from the Hearts viewpoint, it’s all pretty nauseating.What the heid honchos have on their plate right now is probably the biggest decision ever in the history of Scottish football.The Rangers Sevco debate pales in comparison and it’s not like we’ve ever heard the end of that one in Glasgow.Definitely rather them than me. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever decision they come to, it’s going to hurt somebody.And I think they were right to give themselves some breathing space with Monday’s statement.Personally, I’d have picked a date in the middle of April and said we’ll see what’s what at that point with some plans thought up in the meantime.Initially, I was in favour of restarting the season in the autumn and then running straight into the new one, maybe scrap the League Cup. The transfer window and players’ contracts ending in May June just makes that a can of worms.Now, though, I’ll echo my colleague Lee Wilkie’s thoughts yesterday – expand the structure and keep as many clubs happy as possible.As in so many situations in le – do what big Wilkie says . . .It was only right Uefa postpone the European Championship until next summer – there was no other call to make.The championships would have put a completely unreasonable time limit on getting club football – whenever it gets going again – finished in time.However, the decision to knock the qualying play-offs back to June seems very short-sighted.I would be delightedany football is played before June, to be honest.I really think we’re in for a long, long haul of society shutting down to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.And Uefa should be aware they will likely just have to kick the can on the play-offs down the road again in three months’ time.They are such massive games for countries like us and I’m sure Scotland boss Steve Clarkewill want his players to have been in action for a few weeks going into the Israel game.Very little of this situation is fair but I can’t help but think Uefa have been a bit quick to make these decisions.Dundee and Dundee United have more to lose from this season being cancelled than almost anybody.Hearts would be the exception and possibly Partick.However, missing out on a place in the Premiership, particularly for United when it was nailed on, would be massively unfair. The Dark Blues can make an argument themselves about the play-offs, too.The work, and pots of cash, already put in this season has to count for something.THE world might be going down the drain but I have to try to see a silver lining. With the season stopped and, possibly declared null and void, my team Queen of the South can’t be relegated, so there’s that . . ."},{"url":null,"title":"kanzen karate announces cancellation of its international competition in may","story":"Kanzen Karate has announced it has had to cancel its international competition, The Kanzen Cup.The th Kanzen Cup International Open was scheduled to take place in May.

It is a measure of the gravity of the challenge we now face that I must today announce the exams will not go ahead this year.”He also said: “We are clear that we must support local authorities to put in place arrangements that ensure the children of key workers, who do not have another parent or carer at home, can be looked after during the day and they have continuing access to all learning and childcare that allows parents or carers to participate in the national response.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.52144141-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.52144141-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.52144141-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.52144141-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"all scottish schools nurseries expected close on friday says nicola sturgeon","story":"Schools and nurseries in Scotland are expected to close at the end of this week, Nicola Sturgeon said.The first minister said schools have now lost too many staff to continue as normal and said she wanted to reassure teachers and school staff that the Government would work with them as they know what is best for children.mdash Tom PeterkinMarch , She said the Scottish Government is still working out the finer detail of what this will all mean.Nicola Sturgeon said: “My view is that it is inevitable we will close schools and nurseries.“My planning is that schools will close at the end of this week and I wanted today to give parents notice of that news.“There are two key drivers of that view.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Countries with a more dirigiste approach, like France, and outright authoritarians, like China, are taking the lead with hyper-lockdown backed by fines and riot police and sweetened by bold promises that firms and workers will not lose out.Whether that is possible or just vain-glorious hot air from the Elyseacutee Palace remains to be seen. The Scandinavians are taking a typically communitarian approach and promising people that the state will provide calibrated compensation to bolster incomes. But their social safety net was anyway far more generous than in neoliberal Britain.We have the lowest pensions, the lowest sick pay, the most miserly unemployment benefit and income support. And still millions are unable to access it in the gig economy or because they earn too little. Britain after a decade of austerity is a low-wage, low-security economy, and that isnrsquot going to change overnight. Or could it The country will have to be mobilised as in a war. The Second World War was actually very good for the economy ndash or at least good for GDP. The United States turned industry into a weapons-making machine of unprecedented productive power. The Arsenal of Democracy turned out hundreds of warships, thousands of tanks and bombers, millions of guns, billions of pieces of ammunition.Wages and profits soared during the war economy in America and in those parts of the world not actually devastated by the fighting. It was war production that finally brought the Great Depression to an end. Indeed, it arguably laid the groundwork for the next  years of global economic growth.Full employment became the default policy for western governments. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated. We had the NHS, welfare, mass consumerism. Then came inflation, globalisation, neoliberalism and the financial crisis.After , the Government and the Bank of England mobilised some pound. trillion to stave off a collapse of the financial system. That was a very crude way of dealing with the crisis and created moral hazard by rewarding bankers for their reckless greed.But that isnrsquot going to work this time, evenwe wanted it to. The banking system is not the epicentre of this crisis. And the inconvenient truth is that the Covid- crisis is not going to be like the Second World War.Battleships and Sherman tanks are useless against an enemy like a virus. We can produce respirators and intensive care units in large numbers and probably quite quickly ndash quicker than many people seem to believe. But that is not going to make the economy boom.The coronavirus economy is more like the Great Depression, when millions were out of work, demand dried up in the shops, the economy went into a deflationary spiral and even loose credit and money-printing become pointless. Put simply:no one has any money to buy stuff, stuff doesnrsquot get made. Money needs to get into peoplersquos pockets, and fast. What we did for the banks in  we must now do for people.However,you simply throw printed money at a situation like this, the danger is that we will end up with what they have in Zimbabwe: hyperinflation. So we are going to have to create a simulacrum of a war economy. People will have to be remunerated for the socially responsible task of staying at home for the duration.This is a bit like Universal Basic Income, only more so. The trouble with UBI, advocated by right-wing economists like Milton Friedman, in Capitalism and Freedom, and sponsored by tech billionaires today, is that it is essentially universal basic poverty. The sums talked about in the UK, or deployed in the experiments such as in Finland, are nugatory ndash around pound a month. That is too little either to keep body and soul together or provide effective demand in the economy.What we need is more like Universal Average Income. People will need to have something approaching their remuneration pre-Covid to stop them going into spontaneous spending lockdown. If that happens, the demand shock across the economy ndash and itrsquos already happening to airlines, restaurants and hotels ndash could destroy the economy within a couple of months.The good news is that ndash unlike the Second World War ndash we do know who is going to win in the war against Covid , and we know it will not last for many years. Around  per cent of us will get it the vast majority will be fine and the epidemic should be over in  months at the most. We didnrsquot know that about Hitler.In the aftermath, the Government might also have to consider job creation on an industrial scale. One way would be to go with the flow and recruit redundant service workers into the caring professions. The Government could create a kind of National Social Care Service to parallel the NHS. People could retrain as psychologists to treat the growing problem of mental illness.In the s, Franklin D Rooseveltrsquos New Deal measures to combat depression, economic and psychological, included investment in the arts. Unemployed writers, artists and performers were put to work by the Federal Arts Project to improve the quality of le. That gave us Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Orson Welles, John Housman. The arts may seem low on the priority list, set against food supplies and the health service, but it would be a tragedytheatres closed and talent went to waste.We need something to elevate the spirit. There is a serious risk that with the malign effect of social media, people are going to be subject to waves of paranoia, fear and depression. I feel it myself. We live in a spiritually-deprived culture where we are not accustomed to living with death. The churches were where people turned in moments of crisis in the past.

Taking Control: The Dominic Cummings Story, was a look at Boris Johnsonrsquos chief aide by Emily Maitlis. Quite the accolade. An hour-long film in a prime time slot by the slayer of Prince Andrew. Must be a very important chap.You would think so by the talking heads asked to sum Mr Cummings up in a word. Determined, said one. Challenging, said another. Unreasonable. Renaissance man. A myth maker. Unpleasant. Genius. Dangerous.: Johnson promises help for rentersThe producers had even dug up Peter Mandelson, who was once to Labour premiers what Mr Cummings is supposed to be to Boris Johnson, but with infinitely better clothes. ldquoHe could just completely blow himself up, purred the Labour lord as he stroked an invisible white cat, ldquobuthe doesnrsquot hersquos going to be a very signicant figure over the course of the next ten years.While a familiar canter through the Cummingsrsquo cv, starting with his work on the Nocampaign, and taking the story through to Vote Leave, Brexit and into Number , it was worth watchingonly for Maitlisrsquos interview with Colin Perry, who told of his now famous encounter with Mr Cummings decades ago.During a heated discussion on  Live, Mr Perry, chair of the CBIrsquos small business council at the time, called Mr Cummings ldquoa young politician on the make. Their spot over, Mr Perry said he was walking down the stairs from the studio when he felt Mr Cummingsrsquo hands on his shoulders. ldquoHe was trying to push me down the steps, he claimed. At the bottom of the stairs he said he turned to confront Mr Cummings only for the younger man to seize him by the tie, push him against the wall and raise his fist. Mr Cummings said they had merely stumbled into each other.: Holyrood spring conferences axedThe programme asked what Mr Cummingsrsquo ldquoextraordinary rise told us about how politics was changing. Its central idea was that he was among the first to detect and then ride the wave of populism that led, among other things, to Brexit and the election of Boris Johnson. Scotland played a part in this tale in as much as Mr Cummings, then working for Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, suggested his boss visit Easterhouse in a bold move to show how the party had changed. Easterhouse, then, was the early prototype for the ldquored wall that delivered a huge majority for Mr Johnson in .Going back to those one word assessments of Mr Cummings, Irsquom with the journalist Peter Obone who described him as ldquodull. It is hard to take seriously the idea of Mr Cummings as a genius, the sage of Downing Street, in large part because he has committed the most basic error of any adviser and become the story. Being visible, he is expendable.Moreover, one cannot help thinking thathe was that smart he would be in Boris Johnsonrsquos job and have a lackey of his own. Mr Cummings is not the messiah. Hersquos not even an especially naughty boy . He just happens to be the latest catnip mouse for the media to play with till it gets bored.: Schools to close by end of weekThe main feeling on watching Maitlisrsquos documentary was that the concerns it highlighted were dated and irrelevant. Not so much five minutes ago as five months. Much has been made of how the coronavirus crisis is changing our lives and will have a long term impact in ways we have yet to fully appreciate. I donrsquot know. The triumph and tragedy of humans is that fundamentally we do not change that much. Capable of great kindness and empathy, as in the many people who are volunteering to help others, they can also be the same grubby, panic-buying shower to be seen in every supermarket.That said, the crisis is having an impact on politics. I donrsquot mean the suspension of party hostilities. That will not last. As yesterdayrsquos PMQs showed, there is growing pressure on the UK government to help the poorest and most vulnerable to the same extent that it is aiding business.The crisis is, however, shaping the way Mr Johnson does political business, from the new ministerial structures and implementation committees to the daily televised press briefing. I would not be surprisedthese White House-style events became permanent fixtures, like televised debates during elections, in London and Edinburgh. Any chance to hold governments to account is good for democracy.One way and another, the man who a couple of weeks ago was being slated by critics as a part-time Prime Minister is putting in quite the sht.So, too, is Nicola Sturgeon, and though it is hardly a competition she is coming out of the process better. All over the world the virus crisis is testing leaders and governments as never before. Whatrsquos that Warren Buffett quote  ldquoOnly when the tide goes out do you discover whorsquos been swimming naked.Thus we have the so-called strongmen of politics, from the US president down, exposed as vacillating and unconvincing. The most prized government commodity today is trust, and we can see who inspires it and who does not. Mr Johnson is beginning to look tired and bowed. If this crisis does prove to be a marathon not a sprint he needs to pace himself.If the past weeks show anything about politics it is that in times of stre people still look to inidual leaders for guidance. No-one ever responded to a crisis by saying, ldquoSend for the PMrsquos chief aide. That reliance on leaders is fine, as long as the right man or woman is in the job.From Edinburgh, London and Paris to Tehran, Washington and further afield, we will soon see the proof of that."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-positive-cases-covid-19-say-symptoms-start-simple-sore-throat---people-can-recover","story":"The virus has so far infected  people in Scotland, and , in the UK.Some nurses have blasted the attitudes by people across the country who are ignoring government advice and continuing to attend pubs, clubs, and not work from home when they are able to.Now, those who have tested positive have begun sharing their journey to diagnosis to remind people of the symptoms that may not appear early on.One man, who wishes to remain anonymous, has been in self-isolation since Monday, March , and is concerned about complacency.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Which surfaces are spreading Covid- \",\"description\": \"Which surfaces are spreading Covid- \",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media zTzISD poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests zTzISD.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Dominic Raab warns COP climate summit in Glasgow could be postponed\"I am a group three patient, the only symptoms I had was a cough and a slight shortness of breath,\" he told the Basingstoke Gazette.\"I am a -year-old healthy person.

Where services are completely suspended, a full refund will be applicable.Mr Hinkles continued: “I would strongly advise our affected customers to manage their booking through our website as we are experiencing exceptionally high call volumes into our call centre.“The situation is incredibly serious and alongside the obvious health and safety implications, puts the future of the entire aviation industry in jeopardy.#With this in mind, we have joined with other UK carriers to seek emergency measures from the Government to support all airlines in the sector.”Hinkles revealed that Loganair staff have been asked to consider a series of measures aimed at protecting employment levels — including reducing working hours by  per cent and accepting a  per cent reduction in salary as a result or taking a period of unpaid leave.He said: “We are working hard to avoid redundancies and lay-offs as have already been seen at major international airlines and as are likely to follow at several UK airlines in the coming days.”It is expected that a quarter of Loganair’s fleet of  aircraft will be put into temporary storage as a result of the schedule reductions.Full details of how to manage your booking are available on its website at www.loganair.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Fureys - I will love you. This is a breathtaking love song.I imagine this is how my parents were. . Sylvester - Do ya Wanna Funk  This is my No dance tune.It reminds me of our disco dance team at Ballykeel youth club.Later during our Rave years BinMan used to play this as a mix.It was lethal. I left all those tapes behind when I moved back from England. A huge regret.I’d love to hear them again. Especially this mix. . Glee cast - Oh Holy Night. This is thee most beautul Hymn.I love the lead up to Christmas. It’s a constant in my house. On repeat! I gave off to my girls about watching yet more American rubbish and then became utterly addicted to Glee myself. Their covers are often better than the originals. . Donna Summer - McArthur ParkIn our house I would have frequent discos with my girls.We didn’t have much and often le was hard but we always danced and put on shows. It’s was disco, disco, disco!We had to see who could hold the Note the longest. A few years back Santa brought me a new record player and the girls bought me this album.It’s still a favourite with the  of us. They still love the ‘old’ tunes. . James Arthur - Falling like the stars. I love James Arthur.This song is another level. It reminds me of my partner. . Eurthymics - Here comes the rain again. Another one that should only be played with serious volume. Annie Lennox was so cool. I aspired to have her hair styles.I loved so many of their songs and I still do. . Fleetwood Mac - Songbird. My Shared No album.I got the record again a few years ago and listening to this with the crackle of the record player is a rush of memories Reo Speedwagon ‘Hi Infidelity’ is the other No album I know every word to.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

BirdwatchingBirdwatching is a good way to get out in the fresh air and interact with nature, says Phil Carson, policy officer for sustainable farming with the RSPB.I think it#s a good thing to do because you get away to quieten your mind and it#s quite a mindful activity. It allows you to tune out, appreciate the things that are around you and focus on something that isn#t on TV or negative news, he explains.If you#re going to a shoreline or estuary, you can still see some of the wintering waders and wildfowl.You can see curlew along the shoreline, which is pretty brilliant to look at, and there are redshank, another iconic bird,you are around Belfast Lough.Coming into spring,you are in woodland you#re starting to see migrant species coming back, such as the chfchaff, a warbler from northern Africa which is starting to make its way through.Rewarding places to birdwatch include the RSPB#s Portmore Lough nature reserve which has plenty of wide open spaces where you can stay clear of other people while getting your wildle fix.Some of the waders are coming into breed there at the moment - you could see little grebe along the lake shore, reed bunting in amongst the reeds and wigeon and teal as well.Anywhere that has woodland would be quite interesting this time of year, such as Belvoir Forest or the woodlands in the Glens of Antrim are always pretty good, Phil adds..

ArtDrawing or painting can be a great way to connect with nature without stomping through miles of mud.Artist blogger Ella Masters advises bringing a small sketchbook and using drawing materials that dry quickly, such as pencils, pastels or thin layers of watercolours.. Tai chiWe#ve all seen footage of people in China outside in parks performing the elegant moves of tai chi.Bangor-born Tai Chi teacher Michele Gibsonsays: Normally we do our classes indoors because the weather in Northern Ireland is not generally very suitable, but it can be practised outside - in China they do it outside all the time.But you can do it in snow as long as you#re well wrapped up - you can do it outside at any time.Michele says Tai Chi is a series of exercises that work on dferent parts of the body.They tend to be breathing exercises as well as movement. The movements are aerobic without being like an aerobics class, so they#re good for your heart and lungs in a very gentle way, she says.Tai chi is good for high blood pressure. It massages all your internal organs and it#s very good for your balance.It#s good for your muscles and tendons, keeping them strong and keeping your bones healthy. It#s an all-round good exercise which can be done by anybody. It can even be done sitting down, although it#s mostly done standing.I would recommend it to anybody who feels they need a little exercise but doesn#t want to pound it out in the gym. It#s not overly taxing. If you get up sore the next day you are not doing it right.. Go on a picnicThere#s nothing stopping you from wrapping up in a warm coat and hat, filling a thermos of hot tea and talking yourself up to the top of a mountain.There are loads of places off the beaten track for a picnic with a view, from Divis Mountain and Cregagh Glen to the rugged Kearney coastal walk on the Ards peninsula..

Mountain bikingMountain biking is a high adrenaline and exciting way to get out in the fresh air without coming into contact with others.But Outdoor Recreation NI marketing office Ethan Loughrey says you don#t even have to be super-fit to go mountain biking, with the advent of the new electric bikes.One of the benefits of the fitness elements is getting out on the bike, but the new electric bikes allow people who are unfit or older to get out and get some exercise as well, he says.Most of our National Trails Centres have trails between km and km so there is a good workout, and the good thing about it is that you can stop and admire the view along the way.All the National Trail Centres have very scenic spots where you can stop, such as Kodak Corner at Rostrevor Forest.There#s a lot of research showing how good getting out into nature is for you and for your mental health.It#s advised that people who haven#t gone mountain biking before shouldn#t go alone and Ethan recommends that people should pick a trail dficulty level that suits them - it#s green for beginners, orange for intermediate and red for advanced, with black for particularly fast routes.Mountain biking is still very popular and we#re seeing a lot of people on social media being out and about a lot more than normal at the minute. It#s a nice way to get away from hearing about the virus  , Ethan says.Everything can be a bit overwhelming with the front pages, but mountain biking can get you away from that and give you a bit of perspective while giving you some exercise..

It was bizarre... my le seems to be shaped by geopolitical disasters.About nine months ago, his team at Boston Children#s Hospital received a €m federal government grant to help develop an influenza vaccine for elderly people and children.However, the Co Wicklow man had been keeping a close watch on coronavirus developments in China, and three months ago his team got government approval to turn it into a dual project.There are now dozens of projects worldwide working around the clock to create a coronavirus vaccine, but Dr Dowling is co-leading a project which is specically targeting the most vulnerable in society - the elderly.Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with Covid-, according to the World Health Organisation.Together with Dr Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines programme at the hospital, Dr Dowling is designing a coronavirus vaccine that uses special molecules to boost the immune system.The coronavirus gets its name because each cell is covered with spiky formations that make it look like a crown, or in Latin #corona#. These are called spike proteins.The vaccine will use the virus#s spike protein along with known vaccine adjuvants - small molecules that increase a patient#s immune response.He and Dr Levy#s team have taken blood samples from patients aged between  and , are separating their white blood cells and testing dferent adjuvants to see which work best.The unique vaccine will build on vaccines from prior coronavirus outbreaks and work to make them more effective.I reached out to Dr Peter Hotez at Texas Children#s Hospital and we got his Sars antigen from the  outbreak, Dr Dowling said.He made a vaccine and never got it all the way into clinical trials and ran out of funding as it [Sars] wasn#t an issue any more.So using the current Sars vaccine and mixing it with our best adjuvant, we hope it can make a dference.As for a timeline on when the vaccine may be ready, Dr Dowling says it largely depends on funding.I spent  hours filling out a grant application for this coronavirus project, when that time could be spent far more practically, he said.Dr Dowling thinks developing a vaccine is imperative, as he believes coronavirus could become a seasonal virus.I do believe that it may have been circulating for a long time and has only come to the forefront now, he said.Right now we are heading towards the peak of it, people are social distancing and we#ll see it relax coming into summer, but there is a distinct possibility it could come back again in winter.That#s why we have to keep working and can#t take time off. I have great confidence in my colleagues and the US government that we can push through to develop a vaccine.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Independent.ie  Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHealth chief says Covid- war ‘can be won with communities’Health Service Executive chief Paul Reid has said the country faces into a “an uncertain, unprecedented and unpredictable” time during the Covid- pandemic.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Alongside £m already announced by the Treasury the day before, this amounts to an injection of more than £m, the Secretary of State said.Meanwhile, Stormont has unveiled a £ million official grants programme for vulnerable businesses, alongside a rates holiday for three months for all businesses.It comes after the public have been asked to avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, while hundreds of flights and hotel stays have been cancelled, leaving businesses struggling with cash flow.On Tuesday, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak vowed to do “whatever it takes” to help the economy, as he warned that “never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one”.Among the financial measure outline by Mr Sunak is £bn in government-back loans for business and a rates holiday.If you are a Northern Ireland business owner, here#s what support is available to you.Q Will I still have to pay rates, evenI have had to close A On Tuesday, Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced an emergency £m rates package for all Northern Ireland businesses.

Business leaders have also called on employer#s national insurance contributions to be waived, while those self-employed are also facing a tax payment in July.If you rely on benefits or are struggling financially due to the coronavirus, here#s what has already been announced to help you.Q How can I sign on for benefits during the pandemic A Communities minister Deirdre Hargey has announced that all benefits offices will be closed and contact will be made over the phone to protect the public and frontline staff. All front line services will be suspended initially for a period of three months to assess where we are with this virus and any contact will be done via the telephone or other forms of communications, she said, speaking on BBC Radio Ulster. Appointments have been postponed for a period of three months, which may be extended. Q Do I still have to sign on in person A Ms Hargey said that those who normally have to sign on in person for benefits will no longer have to turn up to the benefit offices. No one will be penalised for any attending the office, she said, adding that those who usually have to submit medical advice or certicates in person are not currently required to do so. Q Will I be contacted about my face-to-face interview A We#re contacting those people over the next few days to let them know their appointments have been suspended initially for a period of three months. We will be constantly reviewing that, said Ms Hargey.

These are payments for those who are on a wage from April  of under £,, low income families who are fallen on hard times - that they can come and apply for a grant for things like household costs, food bills, heating costs, she said. Ms Hargey said she is also moving on issues such as statutory sick pay and universal credit. Those workers who happen to lose their jobs here who are on contracts or who are self-employed can now come forward to claim those benefits and get that additional support, she said. Q I am on the Steps  Success employment programme - do I have to attend A Ms Hargey said: All programmes going forward will be suspended for a period and people will not be penalised for not attending the office.Q I work in a small business - what will my job prospects look like in the near future A Speaking in Stormont on Monday, Mrs Dodds revealed plans to re-ert laid-off staff in the coming months.I think it is something that my department will quickly look at,we are in the position where firms have to close, she said. Many people will have skills in food preparation that we may need in our hospitals and so on as this thing reaches a peak, so we will be looking at this and how,one business closes, there are opportunities in other areas.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus fact check: From masks to mortality rates - how to separate fact from fictionThe coronavirus crisis has become a breeding ground for myths and conspiracies - how do we separate fact from fiction \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHow former army trauma surgeon Michael Ryan from Ireland is leading global fight against coronavirusDr Michael Ryan was at home in his kitchen in Galway one day, and his phone rang, the caller identied himself as Bill Gates.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Death of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Coronavirus: We need clarity, says Belfast gym owner as she closes upTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Ballycastle is best place to live in Northern Ireland, claims guide,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#m going to assume that means you should closeyou have a business like ours but he doesn#t want to say it because I think that means that they will have to up their compensation.The right thing to do is to close to protect the public but everyone is reluctant to do so because we#re not sure what funding we#re going to get,any.Mrs Rea, who is six months pregnant, feels the Government#s advice to those who are expecting a child - to remain home for the next  weeks - is just not feasible.She felt thatshe decided to follow that advice and stay indoors for three months, her business could close permanently.We would be finished because by that stage, and okay, we will have clients who willto us, but we would have to start again by building our reputation and everything, she stressed.As part of Stormont#s Covid- package of measures to delay the spread, Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced an emergency £m rates package to assist businesses. But Mrs Rea doesn#t believe that will do any good.Our rent is almost £, a month but the rates aren#t anywhere near that so deferring a rate payment is really just the tip of the iceberg, she commented.Gym owners across Northern Ireland are now deciding whether to close their doors to protect the public or remain open for a source of income. And while Think Fit is a small one-to-one gym, Mrs Rea sympathised with those in the same position as her and her staff.It#s a really, really tough call because you#re being asked by the Government to choose which to prioritise, the health of the public or you and your livelihood, she said.That#s a really tough call to make because of course you want to say: #Yes I care about public health more than anything #. But how can you say that  It would mean that caring about the public health is going to potentially bankrupt you.We#re in a better position than bigger gyms [in terms of cleanliness] but we#re in a worse position financially because bigger gyms rely mainly on monthly payments coming in for people using the gym.We#re relying on people paying for a block of sessions which no one has been buying in the last  days because they don#t know when they#re going to be able to use them.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Death of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Coronavirus: We need clarity, says Belfast gym owner as she closes upTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Ballycastle is best place to live in Northern Ireland, claims guide,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The government has advised people with symptoms to stay at home and to not leave their house for seven days or If they live with other people, all household members have to stay at home for fourteen days. However, trade unions for medical professionals are pushing for access to Covid- tests so that they can know whether they are infected with the virus and in danger of passing it on to patients. googletag.cmd.push They say that based on current advice, the same people may have to self-isolate more than oncesymptoms re-emerge because without testing there is no way of knowing whether they are immune or still at risk to themselves and other people. GP at Aberfoyle Medical Practice, Dr John O’Kelly raised concerns that one of the doctors at the centre who had a high temperature and flu like symptoms is now off and self-isolating as per government advice. The local doctor said he rang the Western Trust and was told it is not testing health workers yet and he will therefore be off for an ‘extended period’. googletag.cmd.push  Dr O’Kelly, who is former Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Northern Ireland said the practice is managing to cope with two doctors off at present but the loss of any more staff would put signicant pressure on resources. “With regards to testing, I think it would be helpful for testing to be available for health professionals, carers who are attending elderly and infirmed patients and Nursing Residential staff. “If we lose health professionals for - weeks this has a potentially serious knock on effect on the service we can provide.” Askedit was worrying that health workers could potentially be forced to self-isolate more than once, he added: “You are correct that people could be off repeatedly. I am not sure how prepared the service is to deliver that number of tests but I feel it is important we protect and support our front line services. “The World Health Organisation, who are the most experienced in dealing with epidemics - although this is pandemic - have recommended testing as an essential element in getting control. “At present we are managing to cope with two doctors down, further losses including loss of nursing and secretarial support, will put incredible strain on our resources.” Yesterday British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to ramp up testing but it is unclear how much it will be increased in NI specically. ‘PRIORITY TESTING’ The Department of Health for NI provided an update on testing yesterday evening, saying:“We are working to signicantly increase our testing capacity so that we can support testing of health and social care workers. “Members of the public who have been advised to self-isolate at home will not be routinely tested. Testing will continue to be carried out as appropriate on iniduals admitted to hospital and testing may also be carried out to support the management of outbreaks or clusters of disease in residential or care settings. Testing capacity is urgently being expanded in order to enable testing of essential healthcare workers.” In response to a question from Derry Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson earlier this week, Health Minister Robin Swann, revealed that ‘owing to constraints on lab capacity, locally and nationally, testing is now being prioritised for a number of groups’. “The current order for priority testing during periods of signicant demand is, first, a patient requiring critical care for the management of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome , influenza or an influenza-like illnessand, secondly, a patient with an alternative indication of severe illness, such as severe pneumonia or ARDS,” he explained. “The next group is all other patients who require admission to hospital for the management of pneumonia, ARDS or an ILI. A further group is the cluster of disease in residential or care settings for example, long-term care facilities and prisons. Symptomatic healthcare workers will be tested as well. “That is under active review, nationally and locally. Additional capability is being urgently worked up in the lab system, and that will ease some of the demand pressures on lab services. It is not that we have reduced testing but that we are now prioritising the testing capability that we have available, and we are increasing that capability.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A core aim of the surge plans - covering the immediate period to mid-April - is to prioritise essential services and free up capacity across the system. The Minister spelt out the plans in a written statement to the Assembly. He stated: “Our health service will fast become unrecognisable. Changes that would have seemed unthinkable weeks ago will become the new norm. Decisions that would previously have taken months or even years will be taken in hours.” He also stated: “If social distancing and other measures are implemented by the population, with a combined effect they could reduce the peak by some % and reduce deaths by up to a third. Planning assumptions also indicate that % of infected people will require hospitalisation, .% will require critical care, and % will die – although these figures will y highly depending on age and other health factors. googletag.cmd.push “There is no doubt that these measures come at a cost. They will be dficult for people to stick to. They will have signicant social and economic impacts. But they will save lives.” The Minister praised staff across the health and social care sector, stating: “I am proud of you and I commit to giving you my full support in the days and months ahead. The words ‘thank you’ seem woefully inadequate in the circumstances but they still need to be said – on behalf of everyone across our society.” Mr Swann also appealed to the general public. “We all must continue to rigidly follow the advice on hand-washing and ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ when we cough or sneeze and use a tissue. I cannot emphasise this enough. This will help keep more of our family members, neighbours and friends well and by doing so reduce pressures on our health service. As I have already stated publicly, doing the right thing is essentialthe health and social care system is to get through this. googletag.cmd.push “This also includes following all the social distancing guidance to the letter, not just today, tomorrow and next week but throughout the months ahead, for as long as it takes.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I came up with an idea for an initiative to try to promote a more positive perspective for people at what feels like a very dark time for everyone. Its my suggestion that, while we remain in this time of social distancing, people place a set of Christmas lights in a front window of their home to promote a feeling of togetherness, mutual support and as a gesture of gratitude for all those who are out there still working to help all us through this dficult time.She believes this simple gesture could have a powerful effect, especially for children.At night when we look out and see the lights twinkling from our neighbours windows, well be reminded that were all in this together and united in our support for one another. It will also be symbolic of our hope and a reminder that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. googletag.cmd.push This message and initiative is particularly important for children who, while they seem to be relatively unaffected by this virus health-wise, can be massively affected by anxiety, both their own and that of the people around them.Ms Doherty has set up an instagram page Light Up Initiative where people have already been sharing pictures of their lit up windows. Its such an important message so Im encouraging everyone to continue share the light @lightupinitiative, she added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I came up with an idea for an initiative to try to promote a more positive perspective for people at what feels like a very dark time for everyone. Its my suggestion that, while we remain in this time of social distancing, people place a set of Christmas lights in a front window of their home to promote a feeling of togetherness, mutual support and as a gesture of gratitude for all those who are out there still working to help all us through this dficult time.She believes this simple gesture could have a powerful effect, especially for children.At night when we look out and see the lights twinkling from our neighbours windows, well be reminded that were all in this together and united in our support for one another. It will also be symbolic of our hope and a reminder that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. googletag.cmd.push This message and initiative is particularly important for children who, while they seem to be relatively unaffected by this virus health-wise, can be massively affected by anxiety, both their own and that of the people around them.Ms Doherty has set up an instagram page Light Up Initiative where people have already been sharing pictures of their lit up windows. Its such an important message so Im encouraging everyone to continue share the light @lightupinitiative, she added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like many others at present, the drama student at Ulster University’s Magee Campus is working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic but her mind is firmly focussed on the task at hand on Saturday night. She’s having ‘withdrawal symptoms’ from not seeing her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila, who have also become household names thanks to their guest appearance on the show. googletag.cmd.push But Brooke has been calling them on a regular basis and wants to ensure they’re kept safe.  The -year-old is from Bellaghy Co. Derry but lived in the Rosemount area for two years while studying and has family connections in the city. Her love of music developed at home, growing up her father ‘almost burnt the house down’ when he fell asleep as a child listening to the record player. None of her family are singers but they’re all passionate about music and listen to the ‘golden oldies’. Brooke’s own taste has been informed by those cherished records and she’s been fortunate enough to see idols live such as Dolly Parton, Cher and Tina Turner. Other favourites include the Eagles, Aerosmith and John Mayer. googletag.cmd.push She never envisaged a career in music - ‘every competition I entered I never got through, except from one year at Ballymena Festival which I won’, she said. Unbeknown to Brooke a friend submitted an application of her to audition for The Voice UK . She was shocked to get call back from the producers before going across to England in April last year, where she secretly filmed her Blind Audition – an experience shrouded in secrecy from her wider friends and family. AFFIRMATION  At the beginning of January Brooke’s first appearance was aired on ITV. All four coaches were visibly moved by her performance. First to turn were will.i.am and Meghan Trainor and they were quickly followed by Sir Tom Jones and Olly Murs. A tug-of-war took place between the coaches but American singer-songwriter Ms Trainor convinced the Derry woman to join her team and quickly declared that she had a potential winner on her hands. That cover of Lewis Capaldi song Bruises was a breakthrough moment and one that changed her outlook. “I’m so grateful for everything because it really has shown me that by getting turns from all the coaches, it has reassured me and reaffirmed everything that I want to do, it has given me that push and urge to say, ‘I should be doing this, I will do it and be as good as I can’.” It has already proven a seminal moment in her le and one which she now uses as motivation. “I watch that back on my phone when I’m going to perform on the show again, “ she reflected. “It gives me that lt and belief that I was worth the four chair turn. “I genuinely didn’t think it was a good performance of that song because as soon as they turned I went into panic mode. I’ve sung it so much better. “But the crowd were standing applauding, it was a surreal moment and one I’ll never forget.” Directly after the performance the -year-old’s sense of humour shone through, while speaking to the coaches she joked to Tom Jones and Olly Murs that her grannies were both single. Her own harshest critic, Brooke also wasn’t happy with her performance during the Battles round and views this Saturday night as an opportunity to redeem herself. Saturday’s Knockout performance is set to be special as she sings a song that is close to her heart. “It’s a song with a lot of meaning for me, it was the first song people heard me sing in school and has had a lot of luck for me. I hope it does again on Saturday,” she added. ROLE MODEL The reaction in her hometown and further afield has been humbling and spurred her on. She explained: “People have been so supportive, particularly over the last few days when I’ve noticed my social media followers going up. “To think that people want to listen to me is amazing. I’m so glad I have the local support and want people to be proud of me and able to relate to me because I live in the same place.” A woman of many talents she also plays camogie having represented the county team and Bellaghy’s senior team. She shares the interest in sport with family members including her younger brother and two older sisters. However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

Seven years later, he would be the first Maghera senior footballer to lt silverware after their MacLarnon Cup win over Omagh CBS. Back to back Ulster minor winner Laverty played on the Derry senior team of the mid-s, picking up two senior medals. His first cousin and godfather Colm Mulholland, who turned  in December played for Derry in the  All-Ireland final. Lavertys Derry senior debut came by chance. Jim McGuigan was organising the transport to Sligo for the opening game of the pre-Christmas section of the   league. googletag.cmd.push He asked Lavertyhe wanted to go to the game on the bus, just to watch. After all the ious pick up points passed, there were only  players on board, including Anthony McGurk who was nursing a sore ankle. “Do you want to play,” McGuigan asked in the direction of Laverty. Before he had a chance to reply, manager Paddy OHara told McGuigan to get him togs and socks a pair of boots from somewhere. “So there I was playing my first game. I remember the game was moved to Tobercurry, because of a waterlogged pitch. We won the game and remember Michael Kearns was playing for Sligo.” googletag.cmd.push It would be a further four years before he would make his championship debut. During that time, as a student at St Joes in Belfast, he won an All-Ireland Fresher medal and three Ryan Cupmedals. Regrettably, despite having a team capable of winning the Sigerson, the Ranch werent permitted to enter. With his native Lavey, he played for over  years, winning two championships, but for the last  years he calls Portrush his home. Every day, he will walk down the Coleraine Road to the shop, passing back over from County Antrim to his native Derry. He will pass the home of John Eddie Mullan, a league winner with the Oakleafers in , and the pair would often chat. Last week, when Lavertys phone rang and the opportunity arose to rake up the memories of  again, there was an excitement in his voice. Last year he had the thyear gathering of the  minor winning team that were defeated by Cork in All-Ireland final. “Brendan Kelly, Mickey Moran, Vincent Conway, Frankie McCotter and myself were on that team,” Laverty remembers. “The MacLarnon Cup final was a really good game of football compared to the MacRory which was dour and not very interesting.” Martin ONeill, who would later that year play alongside Laverty for Derry minors, played on the winning St Malachys team, managed by Phil Stuart, that lted the MacRory Cup. “Hugh Cudden, our goalkeeper, is now in Canada and Liam Harbinson is away in South Africa or Zimbabwe and Frankie McCotter lives in London.” Laverty scored one goal in the final with Harbinson, who played some Irish league soccer, notching the other, after dribbling clear of Omagh defence. “Liam is a relation of Sean OConnell and had a swagger like Sean OConnell. He was a very good soccer player, as was Mickey Moran. Playing in the school playground, you would know they had a bit of skill from soccer about them.” In those days, as Laverty remembers, organised games against other schools didnt come into vogue until third or fourth year. “What struck out for me, when we started in St Pats Maghera, there was only  pupils at it. We went into the assembly hall, there was no floor in it, we were standing on the grass as the school wasnt totally finished. “Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt took us in the early years. Then we had Sean Murphy and Eamon Small coaching us as well.” There were few highlights of the football in the early years but soon there was a greater enthusiasm and more boys were taking an interest. Frankie Kearney left the staff, going to St Pauls Kilrea. McKevitt went back to teach in the Abbey. Sean Murphy, with Jim B Bradley assisting him, took over the running of the senior team. “It was brilliant,” enthuses Laverty. “We were the first senior team and got Maghera into the MacRory. Adrian Boyle was still at Maghera the following year and remembers playing in the MacRory. “It was a fantastic feeling to win it and Omagh had a great team at that time. It was a ding dong game. We had a good team and were all very determined to win on that day.” Laverty was the captain and refers to manager Sean Murphys qualities in the classroom being transferred to the dressing room. “He was a good teacher and then he was a good manager as well. Everybody wanted to play for him. He had a good way of getting things across and he was a good motivator, you wanted to play for him.” Another ingredient for success, which Laverty mentions, was the school basketball team. Under the watch of Charlie Murphy, they won the Ulster title, with a - win over Methody. “It was up in San Souci Park, in Queens,” he adds, with the details floating down the phone-line asit were yesterday. There was a hiccup before the final. Maghera didnt have numbers on their vests and wouldnt be allowed to compete until a local intervention saved the day. St Colms Draperstowns U team were there and coach Seamus Kelly, loaned them their vests. Kelly, who passed away recently, would have an influence on Lavertys Derry career under Frankie Kearneys tenure. “Seamus was a shrewd man and was one of the mentors of Derry teams of ,  and . Sean OConnell would have been helping out with training – while still playing – and big Liam Hinphey was the motivator. Seamus Kelly was the tactician, he was very quiet but was shrewd operator.” “Methody came out in silk tops and togs, with all their fancy numbers. The vests we got were as tight as a fiddle string and too small for us. “There was a Methody boy who got a few tackles that day, that werent part of basketball, but thats another story,” added Laverty, with a hearty laugh. On the basketball starting team of five, were Mickey Moran and Eugene Laverty. Tommy McCloy of Lavey was another footballer but would leave school before the MacLarnon winning season. Also at the school during that era was current Lavey man Paddy Shivers, who went on to play for Derry as well. Laverty cant understand why Shivers wasnt on the Maghera team at that time. “I wasnt good enough,” Shivers has recently told Laverty. “He was a good footballer. He coached the team and played on the Lavey team for years. He was a PE teacher up in St Colms in Draperstown, took teams and did very well.” Laverty never forgot Shivers. He knew his footballers and, especially, a midfielder when he saw one. Winning captains names will continue to go up on the walls of St Patricks Maghera, but Eugene Laverty will always be the first. From the team on , who set the standard for others to follow. READ ALSO - Match report - Omagh - Maghera - Click here...

The letter stated: “Why is this virus happening to us  It is taking everything away from us day by day. This is so hard to accept and understand. googletag.cmd.push “I will miss my friends, my teachers, my classrooms, the bus run, the sound of the bell, the sound of the playground at break times, the sound of the music in the corridors, the smell of lunch from the canteen, the building itself, I will even miss my grade cycles, my cleaning staff, my canteen staff and my principal. “How hard we can try just cant create that from home, because together we are a team, together right here in this building we are a family.

The closures will take place with a phased approach from today and over the coming days. The decision comes less than a week after council closed all its buildings to the public and cancelled a number of up and coming public events. Members met again today to get an update on council services and contingency measures being put into place by council to protect its staff and the public and help reduce the risk of COVID- across the Council area. Members heard that while play parks will be closed over the coming days, public parks and cemeteries will continue to remain open. googletag.cmd.push Other essential services such as bin collection services will continue to operate. Recycling centres remain open however some adaptations have been made to limit the number of cars entering sites at the one time in an effort to encourage social distancing. Members also agreed to postpone the Foyle Maritime Festival and the Strabane Summer Jamm both scheduled to take place over the summer months. Earlier this week Clipper Ventures confirmed to Council that the Clipper   Race is postponed. Members also heard that a number of signicant events including the Worker’s Rights and Social Justice Week and the Battle of the Atlantic VE Day commemorations planned for May have also been cancelled. googletag.cmd.push Events scheduled beyond the summer months will remain under review. In line with Government guidelines, many council staff are working from home while others providing front line services continue to report to work where internal working arrangements that include social distancing and additional health and safety measures are being implemented. All of this is being done in full consultation with unions, with a commitment to provide as many essential services as possible. Members were provided reassurance by council officials that adaptations have been made within council services to facilitate the continued delivery of vital services and that any operational changes to any service will be communicated to the public. While some council committee meetings have been postponed, new arrangements have been put in place for a Full Council meeting to take place later this month. Members were of the view that the key decision making process should continue for as long as possible. Members were also informed that while the City of Derry Airport is open and fully operational and council in partnership with the CODA Board is looking at contingency measures to mitigate against the severe and immediate financial impact of COVID- and is engaging with Ministers and officials over the coming days to discuss options for protecting this vital service. Elected members were informed that the council’s Business Support team are currently disseminating the information from Central Government in relation to rates relief and business support and will be available to offer advice and guidance to local business. In relation to community resilience and community support members were informed that Council is currently looking at mechanisms of how it can provide support to the local community sector at this time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle chaired the meeting and welcomed the update and praised the efforts of Council in making key decisions at this challenging time. She spoke about the dficulties being faced by the local business community sector and made reference to the decision by O’Neill’s in Strabane to close its doors. “This is hugely sad news for Strabane and not an easy decision for Kieran and his team to make but I think it’s the right one and we will hopefully see the business up and running again in the near future.” The Mayor added: “The Council continues to provide strong leadership and is putting the health and safety of its staff and the public to the fore as it responds to this crisis in a responsible and proactive manner. The Council is also being proactive in working with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and service provision.” Providing reassurance to the public, the Mayor said that while Council facilities are closed to the public, essential services will continue for as long as possible and they can contact the Council directly at    or follow Council on Twitter and Facebook and on the Council website atwww.derrystrabane  coronavirusfor regular updates.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Our priority is protecting our people and saving lives, which is paramount. As an Executive, we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so in the days, weeks and months ahead but we all have a role to play to protect ourselves and others from Covid-.The Executive has also paid tribute to health service staff who are performing ldquoheroically during this unprecedented time.Mr Swann said the entire health service is under growing pressure and appealed to people not to add to it unless they had to.ldquoPlease, please be patient and treat our great staff with respect, said the health minister. ldquoThey are there to care for you you are their first concern. Please show them the same concern and consideration.The Executive has also taken the opportunity to urge the public to follow the public health advice which means continuing to wash hands regularly for at least  seconds and anyone with mild symptoms should stay at home they will not need to be tested.People are asked not to contact or go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or emergency department. If symptoms worsen during home isolation or you are no better after seven days, seek medical advice by telephone.Those with an underlying health condition and who develop symptoms are advised to let their GP know and only only call  in an emergency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Catholic.jpg","title":"Catholic Principals’ Association calls on Education Minister to close schools  ","story":"AT least three schools in the district have confirmed they pupils who may have been exposed to coronavirus.The closure of all schools appears likely within days as pressure mounts on Education Minister Peter Weir to follow the example of the Irish government and close all schools and colleges.Mr Weir ruled out full-out closure on Monday, but yesterday the Catholic Principalsrsquo Association, called for an immediate closure of all schools.First Minister Arlene Foster indicated that the closure could last for up to four months.All school principals and teachers have been working hard to protect pupils this week in the face of the coronavirus threat.Any planned parent teacher evenings have been cancelled and many schools are restricting access into the school apart from staff and students.Many schools have taken exceptional closure days on Monday and from tomorrow to Friday to allow teachers time to prepare lesson packs for students as well as preparing for online lesson sessions in the anticipation of closure.These include De La Salle High School and St Brigidrsquos Primary School in Downpatrick. St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race.

He was asked about NHS staffing, and concerns that we are nowhere near where we need to be.These are all legitimate and indeed important questions.But at the same time, it is vital that we all understand a few elementary things about this crisis.The first is that while of course it is crucial that the Province gets every penny of funding it possibly can from the Treasury, we must realise that this is a massive global health challenge for every country on earth.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It is all very well to observe that the NHS faced huge pressures even before the coronavirus, which it did , but we must also recognise that no healthcare in the world could cope with perhaps % of its population being infected in a short period of time. If % of them are hospitalised, then % of any nation’s population could be in hospital within a short period of time. No health system has the ventilators it will need, not even the richest countries in the world. Germany or Japan or the US.Therefore we must do our part in flattening the curve, and the single most important element in that in this voluntary stage is that people observe prudent movements and social distancing. There is not yet a bar on people visiting one another or going to cafes and other such public settings. We all can try to observe a one or two metre distance from other people in that context, as well as relentless washing of hands. Across Northern Ireland, people are gathering together less closely than they did. But there is still some conduct that suggests many people do not know the seriousness of this. To maintain freedom of movement that is helping keep businesses alive we need to observe these simple rules.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Fear and uncertainty is widespread throughout this community,” she said.“There will be a long term impact on the mental and economic health of the citizens of this City and Borough but the measures we have enacted so far are within the scope of our organisation.”Members then heard from the Chief Executive, Roger Wilson who reminded elected representatives of their duties in a time of crisis.“We are Council, we are the form of government closest to its citizens and, as civic leaders, we need to lead our community through this,” he said.“We are not the only people who have a role in this but we need to make sure we are all pulling in the one direction.“Many people are scared and are looking for information. Speaking to many of you, I know that you are being inundated by people looking for help and I would seek members approval to make decisions quickly as things are moving at a very fast pace.“There willbe a big impact on our communities mental well being and health and that is a challenge we will all have to face. We need to accept that and find a way to support our community.”The motion to support Council’s ongoing approach to thecoronavirus situation was proposed by Councillor Paul Berry and seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.Speaking after the motion was passed Sinn Fein’s Catherine Nelson thanked Council staff and officials for their tireless work and implored Council to consider using its cash reserves to help the local community through this crisis.“The rule book goes out the window at a time like this,” she said on behalf of her party.“Big decisions will need to be made and time will be no friend of ours. We give the Chief Executive and senior management team our full support. We have trust and faith in you.“I would ask for an imaginative and exhaustive approach. We don’t have to try and reinvent the wheel but we should be mindful of the mental health of our citizens and think about what we can do to help them.“We should think of walks, the appropriate use of our open spaces, drive in cinemas and even the use of our reserve fund to help those in need.“We talk about saving the reserves for a rainy day, we will never get a rainier day than what we are about to experience.”Her sentiments were echoed by independent Councillor Paul Berry who also urged Council to do what it could to keep businesses informed.“I would request that the information is kept flowing daily,not hourly because the message from businesses is clear, very few of them have more than a very short space of time to go.“Urgent intervention is required as we speak.It is important we try and keep SMEs and large businesses up to date on a daily basis to encourage them to try and hang in there.”The Ulster Unionist Party’s Julie Flaherty also urged Council to unite for the good of the community.“This is a time when we need to come together like never before,” she said.“We need to maximise the community response. We also want to extend our thanks to the Chief Executive and senior officials. You have our full support and we will strive to keep people informed.“The impact of this will be felt in our communityfor a long time and the UUP, along with this council, will be at the forefront of this issue.”The Alliance Party’s Peter Lavery also outlined his party’s support for the Chief Executive and said now is the time to set aside political dferences in order to protect le.“We look forward to hearing how we can help support local businesses,” said Cllr Lavery.“Council will play a strong role in lobbying central government on behalf of our community and we all know this situation will get worse before it gets better.“We must do all we can to support our community.”Democratic Unionist Party colleagues, DarrynCausby and Steven Moutray also extendedtheir appreciation to the Chief Executive, senior management team and all Council staff for their efforts.“Thistsunami is sweeping across the world and it will have a negative effect on our businesses,” said Cllr Moutray.“We need to know what we can do to help them and we, as councillors, will ensure that everyone is made aware of the help on offer.”Cllr Causby commended Cllr Nelson for her suggestion on using Council funds.“I would like to say that the idea of a community fund already mentioned by Catherine Nelson is something we should look at going forward,” he said.“As we move forward in this very dficult environment, we will work as best we can to take the dficult decisionsand provide support to those who need it.”The SDLP’s Thomas O’Hanlon also thanked the Chief Executive and the senior managementteam but warned that bigger decisions would need to be made in the near future.“Our community face very dficult times, they are scared and frightened, just as we all are.None of us are medical experts but it is a civic leaders duty to be calm and measured and ensure we respond with compassion.“We will get through this. Roger, you have made timely decisions so far and you will have more to make but you have our support.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most
