And within just a few hours he was driving it around public roads without wearing a seatbelt - an illegal act‘Who are you?’ he barked menacingly, as he screwed up his eyes trying to read our chest-emblazoned nametags.‘Well sir,’ I replied, ‘I’m afraid you are currently surrounded by the tabloid press.’He stared at me like I’d just told him I’d like fried Corgi for supper, with open-mouthed disgust and revulsion radiating from every crevice of his weather-beaten face.Philip didn’t say a single further word.Instead, he brushed off my still outstretched hand, and turned abruptly left before marching off as fast as he’d arrived.A few yards on, he passed another guest and, looking back at me, loudly sneered to him: ‘My God, you just can’t tell from the outside, can you…’(Ironically, that guest was also a tabloid editor, this proving Philip’s point.)Now, I don’t blame Philip for being so damn rude to me.Parts of the wreckage from Prince Philip\u0027s crash \u0027go up for...\u0027We either receive the same treatment or we don\u0027t\u0027:...Diana\u0027s former bodyguard says the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s crash...Pictured: Mother whose baby was in the backseat during...Share this articleIf someone published endless stories about my family, many scandalous and embarrassing, then I’d be just the same if I met them too.But what staggered me was how he was prepared to be SO rude to someone who was an invited guest at his son’s birthday party.That takes some kind of brass neck.I was reminded of our extraordinary encounter over the past few days, when the whole world has got to see just how brassy Philip’s neck can really be.Last Thursday, he was involved in a serious car crash on a public road near the royal estate of Sandringham in Norfolk on the East Coast of England.Philip, driving a Land Rover Freelander, drove out from a side road into a busy main road and collided with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old baby.Emma Fairweather, the passenger in the Kia, broke her wrist.          Philip, driving a Land Rover Freelander, drove out from a side road into a busy main road and collided with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old babyHer friend, the driver, suffered minor injuries, and the baby, thankfully was unhurt.Philip, miraculously given he is 97 years old and his Land Rover rolled over onto its side, was also unhurt.He has reportedly blamed bright sunshine for temporarily blinding him, so he was unable to see the Kia coming when he pulled out into its path.Other witnesses have suggested it was a cloudy day, and the more likely explanation is his old age impaired his ability to drive.Frankly, I don’t believe ANY 97-year-old should be allowed to drive a car – especially if they have a whole array of servants and bodyguards who can do it for them.But that’s not what bothered me most about this story.No, what ENRAGED me is what happened next.The very next day, a new Land Rover was ostentatiously delivered to Philip in full view of the media.And within just a few hours he was driving it around public roads without wearing a seatbelt - an illegal act.The pictures showed a defiant Philip snarling at the wheel.His message was clear: ‘You won’t stop me driving, I’m rich enough to get a new car whenever I like, and I don’t care about obeying the law of the land.’          Emma Fairweather, the passenger in the Kia, broke her wrist. Her nine-month-old baby was in the back seat And frankly, he made me sick to my stomach.What astonishing arrogance!And how staggeringly insensitive to the people whose car he smashed into only hours earlier!Just imagine the outrage that would have erupted if a famous footballer like David Beckham had behaved like this?He’d have rightly been crucified both in the press, and in the court of public opinion.He’d have also faced almost certain prosecution.Yet Philip, we’re told, has been given just a friendly warning by police.To make matters worse, he hasn’t even bothered to contact the people he hit. Instead, an aide for his wife, the Queen, left a voicemail message saying they were ‘thinking of you very much’.Really?It doesn’t seem to me that Philip has been thinking of anyone but himself, in the most selfish, aloof and inconsiderate possible manner.I’m a big fan of the royals I think they do a huge amount of good for Britain, and our image around the world, that fully justifies – and repays - the vast amount of tax-payer money we spend on them.I also think, notwithstanding his extreme aversion to media people like me, that Prince Philip is an extraordinary man who has devoted most of his life to serving his country superbly well in myriad ways.He certainly fully deserves his recent long-overdue retirement from public life.But he needs to understand this incident has shown him at his privileged worst, and reflects badly on all the royals.The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt.To be so openly, flagrantly contemptuous of public opinion, members of the public, and the law of the land is completely unacceptable – especially if you’re the husband of the Queen.Where is his contrition, or common courtesy?    The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt Philip, as I know to my cost, won’t care what I have to say about his conduct.And he won’t care what the rest of the media thinks either.Nor, it is sadly obvious, does he seem to care about the on-going condition and feelings of the people he careered into.It’s equally apparent he is refusing to listen to a word any of his protection officers are saying to him – because they would have surely begged him not to go back out driving on his own on public roads so soon after an accident, without even belting up.No, there’s only one person in the world who Philip ever listens to and that’s his wife.So I respectfully suggest Her Majesty now has a very firm word in the Duke of Hazard’s cantankerous, belligerent ear, tells him to stop being such a stubborn callous fool, and orders him to give up driving.For his sake, and ours.          So I respectfully suggest Her Majesty now has a very firm word in the Duke of Hazard’s cantankerous, belligerent ear, tells him to stop being such a stubborn callous fool, and orders him to give up driving.

Both French President Emmanuel Macron and Merkel (pictured together today) have pushed the idea of a joint European Army for the bloc that would be part of the wider NATO allianceGermany and France are often described as the engine of the European Union - to the occasional annoyance of other members, who feel sidelined by the cozy relationship between Paris and Berlin.The treaty pledges stronger economic and defence ties and restates the countries\u0027 commitment to the European Union.But it has been attacked by the far right, which accuses the pair of signing away their countries\u0027 sovereignty.The leader of France\u0027s National Rally, Marine Le Pen, accused Macron of \u0027an act that borders on treason\u0027.One of the leaders of German\u0027s far-right AfD party, Alexander Gauland, said Paris and Berlin were seeking to create a \u0027super EU\u0027 within the European Union.\u0027We as populists insist that one first takes care of one\u0027s own country. But we don\u0027t want Macron to renovate his country with German money.\u0027The French presidency defended the bid to build up the \u0027bedrock\u0027 of the EU as being \u0027in the service of reinforcing the European project\u0027. Today\u0027s ceremony comes on the anniversary of a similar treaty in 1963, signed by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer.          Germany and France are often described as the engine of the European Union - to the occasional annoyance of other members, who feel sidelined by the cozy relationship between Paris and BerlinThe new treaty aims to strengthen the so-called the \u0027Franco-German motor\u0027 that has been seen as the driving force behind European integration.\u0027We\u0027re seeing an existential crisis in terms of European integration, with Brexit and the expected strengthening of nationalists at the next European elections\u0027 in May, said Claire Demesmay, a political scientist at German research institute DGAP.\u0027In this context, confirming this belief in Franco-German cooperation has symbolic value,\u0027 she told German public radio.Macron took office in May 2017 promising major reforms of the EU to restore faith in its institutions and quell rising populism.But his ideas met with only lukewarm support from Merkel and other EU leaders, and Paris and Berlin have also differed on other issues including how to tax big internet firms.The French leader\u0027s hand has also been weakened by more than two months of domestic \u0027yellow vest\u0027 protests. The treaty commits France and Germany to closer military ties, including possible joint deployments - in the event of a terror attack, for example.The two countries could also cooperate more closely on procurement, such as the purchase or development of new tanks or fighter jets.And it includes a \u0027mutual defence clause\u0027 in the event of one of them being attacked, although they are already committed to this as members of NATO.Macron sparked a row with US President Donald Trump late last year by urging Europe to reduce its military dependence on the United States, even calling for a \u0027real European army\u0027.Macron\u0027s critics on both the far left and far right slammed the latest accord as an erosion of French sovereignty.A wave of false rumours have spread online that Macron was going to Germany to sign away parts of French territory to Merkel and that France will agree to share its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council with its neighbour. Some other European leaders have also bristled at the idea of an all-dominating \u0027Franco-German motor\u0027.          Merkel in her speech also said that, as France and Germany seek closer political, economic and defence integration, they should also work on a \u0027joint military industry\u0027Italy\u0027s far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has said ahead of the European parliament elections in May that he wants to challenge Merkel and Macron\u0027s pro-European message with a eurosceptic \u0027Italian-Polish axis\u0027.Amid the headwinds, German magazine Spiegel Online noted that while the treaty \u0027is full of good intentions, it lags far behind what is necessary\u0027.\u0027After all the crises and upheavals of recent years, Merkel and Macron have failed to rekindle the fire of European enthusiasm.\u0027Business weekly Handelsblatt also called the contents of the treaty \u0027timid and fainthearted.\u0027Both the French and German leaders have seen easier times, with Germany already looking to a post-Merkel future after she announced she would step down as chancellor in 2021.In France meanwhile, the \u0027yellow vests\u0027 have forced Macron to loosen the state\u0027s purse strings, throwing his deficit reduction drive off target.Both leaders will speak at the signing ceremony at Aachen\u0027s historic city hall before taking part in a \u0027citizen debate\u0027 with French and German students. "},{"url":null,"title":"Colorized images Stan Laurel Oliver Hardy released ahead new Steve Coogan film","story":"    These colorized images of famous comics, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, have been released to coincide with the new film starring Steve Coogan as Laurel and John C Reilly as Hardy. Photographer Nicola Branson said: \u0027Laurel and Hardy was a childhood memory for myself and my sister, and a few others of the silent movie era.

Gav believes he has narrowed Triumph’s wreck site down to a 300 square mile area of the Aegean Sea, between the mainland and an island called AntiparosThey have pledged to help Mr Don, a retired Royal Navy officer, with his quest to find the wreck site.In the Second World War some 79 Royal Navy submarines and over 2,800 men were lost at sea - a casualty rate far worse than Bomber Command.Only 10 of those sunken subs have been found and precisely chartered since. Historians have pinpointed 28 more down to a mile.Mr Don\u0027s aim is to take a boat to Greece and use side-scan sonar technology to find the lost submarine.Mr Don, who now runs his own company in the oil industry, is trying to secure official permissions in Greece to carry out the search and estimates it would cost about £50,000 to fund the equipment and take six months to search.He said: “I grew up with the story of my uncle’s disappearance. His portrait hung on the dining room wall and his medal sat on the windowsill, but my parents didn’t really talk about him.“I always wondered where he is and thought it was bizarre no one knew or tried to find the ship.“The search needs quite a lot of time and money spent on it.“Part of the problem is that all of the other files about Triumph were sunk on its depot ship HMS Medway in 1942.“Personnel records, orders the submarine received - everything that wasn’t sent straight back to the UK was lost.“I have gradually built up a picture for the families. It’s been quite emotional.”Among those backing Mr Don is Wally Wickham, 77, who was just a baby when his father Walter, a petty officer and stoker on Triumph, died.After his father’s death his mother couldn’t cope and Wally spent the rest of his childhood growing up in children’s homes.Colin Child’s father Albert was a commando assigned to the SBS (Special Boat Services) and was on the submarine as part of its covert mission.Mr Child, 78, from Swindon, Wilts, said: “I was only 18 months old when my father died so I have no memory of him.“My mother didn’t talk about him very much and I didn’t know an awful lot about him until about six or seven years ago, when I started researching.“It has been very interesting and I have a great admiration for the crew learning about what they went through.”HMS Triumph had spent a year in the Mediterranean Sea carrying out various duties successfully, including sinking 24 merchant ships and an Italian sub and disabling a heavy cruiser.It was due to return home to Britain when it was ordered to undertake one final patrol in Greece, sailing on December 26, 1941.Mr Don said: “Submarines were probably the most dangerous place to serve. What’s incredible is the guys knew that subs were pretty much a suicidal mission but they went out and calmly did their duty.“Submarines are small and easily forgotten, because it’s just 50 or 60 men dying in a tin can somewhere, it’s not like D-Day but I’m proud that Triumph is probably now the least forgotten submarine of the war.”Lord Boyce, Admiral of the Fleet, was at the reunion at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport, Hants.He said: “We, as submariners, all knew what good these men did during the Second World War - submariners suffered more losses than bombers, particularly in the Mediterranean.“Even the German high staff said the most dangerous British weapon in the Mediterranean was the submarine.“They played a very important role, but the nature of their work means they tend to be forgotten so I think it’s great to see an initiative like this, bringing these families together to celebrate what their relatives did.”  Left: Bombadier Alfred Robert Child, a Royal Marine assigned to the SBS and father of Colin Child who is backing the campaign.

Our writer steps inside this geological marvelPebbles from a nearby riverbed form a chunky cobbled floor in the entrance to the new Muzeum Susch in Switzerland, as if a tributary once flowed through the building. Maybe it still does. The sound of dripping water can be heard coming from the end of a corridor, where a shiny trickle snakes down a bare rock face. There are other strange things going on. Peer through one opening and you find a gnarled column of earth plunging down into the basement, as if it’s the remains of an archaeological dig. Another passage is encrusted with viscous white goo, forming stringy stalactites that lead to a curious cave downstairs.In this beguiling new gallery in the Engadin valley, it is hard to tell where nature ends and artifice begins. It is located on the site of a 12th-century monastery, in a rambling complex of buildings that formerly housed a vicarage, hospice and brewery, and the young architects Chasper Schmidlin and Lukas Voellmy have concocted a magical place where the historic fabric, contemporary art and the raw geology of the landscape collide.The project is the brainchild of Grażyna Kulczyk, former wife of the late billionaire industrialist Jan Kulczyk, and one of Poland’s richest women. A 68-year-old with a platinum-blond bob and a fondness for skin-tight leather, Kulczyk has been collecting art since she was a law student in the 1970s. She has amassed an impressive haul, predominantly focused on female artists, which she describes as a “matrilineage through global art history”.In 2004, Kulczyk established an arts and retail complex in a former brewery in her hometown of Poznań, but sold it in 2015 to concentrate on this Swiss outpost, after plans for a base in Warsaw fell through. The resulting combination of deep-pocketed patronage and Swiss precision is one of the most exquisitely crafted private museums realised in recent years.From the outside, you might be hard-pressed to differentiate the building from any other white-rendered house in Susch. But step inside and the place unfolds as a Tardis-like warren of rooms, leading you from vaulted basements to airy timber lofts and galleries excavated from the mountainside – a process that saw 9,000 tonnes of rock blasted out. It is alpine chalet, primitive grotto and Bond villain’s lair in one.The sleepy village of Susch might seem like an unlikely place to find such an institution. It’s a tiny hamlet with a population of around 200, whose other main feature is a clinic for people suffering from burnout syndrome. But, just a short drive from the gilded playgrounds of St Moritz and Davos, the site isn’t quite as odd as it seems. The museum joins a growing gallery scene that has mushroomed over the last few years to service the area’s wealthy cultured visitors, in search of more than the usual après ski. There are now more than 30 galleries in the Engadin, with Hauser \u0026amp Wirth joining the party last year.To make it stand out from the commercial galleries, Kulczyk says she has conceived the museum as more of a “laboratory”, where a series of permanent site-specific installations by the likes of Adrián Villar Rojas (the stratified column) and Sara Masüger (the gooey cave) will complement a programme of rotating exhibitions. Launching with a feminist bang, the opening show – titled A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women – explores female representation, sexual emancipation and the subversion of traditional gender roles, mixing work from Kulczyk’s collection with international loans. Given that Switzerland was the last European country to give women the vote (with one canton holding out until as late as 1991), the rooms of powerful female forms and gaping yonic voids are a welcome provocation.Without overwhelming the art, it is the building that is the star of the show. Schmidlin and Voellmy, both in their 30s, with one other small gallery in Basel to their name, have struck a brilliant balance between preservation and intervention, amplifying traces of the buildings’ former lives while creating new spaces that are very much their own.The project shows incredible attention to detail throughout, standing as a testament to local craftsmanship and the architects’ ability to deploy a limited palette of materials in unexpected new ways. They have used gravel dredged from the riverbed to make a coarse grey plaster, moulded over the existing masonry like thick icing on a lumpy cake. In other spaces, the rock from their excavations has been ground down and used to form floors of dark polished terrazzo, which spills through the excavated galleries as if it were an oil slick. The material alchemy continues with the use of local larch trees, felled and sliced into 12-metre long floorboards, laid so precisely in one room that it looks like one seamless mat of timber, poured from a vat.Set across multiple levels of sloping hillside, the exhibition spaces range from the crepuscular to the light-flooded. A narrow staircase leads down a former slot between two buildings to a vaulted basement, where Magdalena Abakanowicz’s moulded hessian figures stand like ghosts in the gloom. Upstairs, a former hay loft has been converted into a double-height auditorium and performance space, with huge picture windows that frame postcard-perfect views over the snowy valley.There are constant reminders of the past. Some ceilings are still charred from the beer brewing process, while the former stable block has a manure gutter running through the floor to a low-level window, and a hefty stone watering trough repurposed as a plinth for an archive display. Meanwhile, a triple-height space, once used as an “ice tower” to cool the brewery in summer, has been transformed into an enormous light-well, where Monika Sosnowska’s mangled steel stairs now hang like crumpled ribbons – perhaps a wry comment on where less imaginative architects might have placed a “feature” staircase.But the real drama is found in the bowels of the former brewery, where a storage cave has been enlarged to create a subterranean exhibition space worthy of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. A polished steel cylinder by Mirosław Bałka rotates slowly in the centre of the cave, adding to the sci-fi theatrics, while more water trickles down from the jagged rocky ceiling. It is a fittingly stagey prelude to what comes next: a black-walled concrete bunker, where 200 spot-lit portraits of Nazi generals line the room, their monocled faces and toothbrush moustaches glowing from the walls with camp horror. The controversial work of Polish artist Piotr Uklański (whose similar pieces have forced exhibitions to close in the past), it mocks the ridiculous kitsch of the Third Reich.Some of the art might be shocking, but the most lasting impact from visiting Muzeum Susch is a revelation of a different kind. In this era of design-and-build bodging, when architects are often sidelined and contractors cut corners, buildings can still be made this well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37e657c988155e957974c4a7854e39a86142135a/0_530_2544_1526/master/2544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76ba4a94ebd5fc5d2361f1fd1c6933a","title":"national portrait gallery face new direction revamp","story":"Redeveloped entrance will point towards Soho, despite wishes of a Victorian donorThe National Portrait Gallery is to get a new main entrance more than a century after a rich donor insisted it should not point north towards the filth of Soho and Covent Garden.The entrance is part of a £35.5m redevelopment that is intended to make the gallery more welcoming and less crowded, and to better display contemporary crowd-pleasers such as Sam Taylor-Johnson’s video of David Beckham sleeping.A crowdfunding appeal to help raise money for the project, the gallery’s biggest redevelopment since its current home opened in 1896, was announced by its director, Nicholas Cullinan, on Tuesday.One of the biggest changes will be the new main entrance, created by converting three windows in the northern facade of the building into doors.The project’s architect, Jamie Fobert, said the current narrow entrance was a result of an important Victorian donor insisting that it be placed as close to Trafalgar Square as possible so as not to face the then more disreputable areas of London. After 2023 it will point to Soho.Outside Fobert plans to create a public forecourt, rejuvenating what is a rather shabby, sad area of railings and bins. A statue of the Victorian actor Henry Irving will remain, although moved by five metres.“At the moment it feels like an incredibly unsafe space at night, a certain amount of antisocial behaviour happens behind Henry Irving,” said Fobert.All the relevant bodies have been consulted and are supportive, he said, apart from some niggling fears that street performers who ply their trade in Trafalgar Square may relocate.Another key part of the project is to create new gallery space in the building’s east wing, which is being used as offices.All the building’s galleries will be refurbished to bring a consistency that does not currently exist as rooms have been updated at different times. “The effect of this is to create quite a fragmented experience for our visitors, the decor and ambience changes quite a bit as you walk around,” said Cullinan.Contemporary and 20th-century portraits, which often get displaced or moved because of temporary exhibitions, will be more consistently displayed.Cullinan said: “The most common question that visitors ask is ‘Why does nobody here look like me?’”The gallery has raised £27.4m for the project and hopes the public will be moved to contribute to the £8m that remains to be found. People can sponsor a piece of mosaic in the new forecourt for £50 or, for £50,000, adopt one of the 18 original stone busts of people such as Joshua Reynolds on the exterior of the building.Work is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2683a299c2338c4b710c54d68b10e5288c854d6/0_0_1451_2242/master/1451.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bed30e54bfd9c381f2f8fd982635bfaa","title":"online sales slow as uk shoppers rein in christmas spending","story":"High street gloom spreads online with worst December sales growth in nearly 20 yearsOnline retailers experienced their worst Christmas sales growth in nearly 20 years in 2018 as shoppers reined in buying electrical goods.The poor December topped off a difficult second half for online retailers, echoing their high street counterparts, in what IMRG called a “lopsided year”. Growth around the Black Friday discount day in late November slowed and Andy Mulcahy, strategy and insight director at IMRG, said those sales had not been picked up in December.The numbers, which include data from more than 200 major retailers, indicate that even online-only players – which have benefited from the shift away from the high street – suffered in the last quarter of the year.Mulcahy said: “The first half of 2018 was actually very strong for online retailers – it resisted and arguably benefitted from the tough climate that impacted trade for store retail. It is only the second half of the year where the suppressed confidence and spend, evident in so many other sectors, has spread to online retail the macro-economic situation must be exerting pressure here, particularly with Brexit now entering its crunch period in the first quarter of 2019.”Patrick O’Brien, an analyst at GlobalData, said: “I think Amazon will have been posting very strong growth.”But he said it was not surprising online sales of electrical goods were no longer rapidly increasing. “It’s a market that is already saturated with more than half of the market online. It is no longer a rapid growth market and online sales are decelerating to be more in line with total sales growth.”Bhavesh Unadkat at Capgemini added that online retailers were facing increased competition from cheap high street players, such as Primark, Poundland, Aldi and Lidl, that don’t sell online.“Consumers were tightening the purse strings by taking advantage of promotions rather than purchasing more. This allowed discounters to take the share in the final month of the year,” Unadkat said.Mulcahy said retailers had become stuck in a cycle of discounting and faced challenges from uncertainty about Brexit and low consumer confidence.“If Brexit can be resolved so that a course, whatever that may be, is agreed and pursued, it may help to build shopper confidence again with online likely to be the main beneficiary from a retail perspective,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6153918d82c2426cd3094c6c4966a4c21cb66f/0_207_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9de2e21f73c9046dad190055085df83","title":"after the oil boom luanda faces stark inequality photo essay","story":"The next 15 megacities #8: Photographer Sean Smith captures the extremes of life in the Angolan capitalThe route from London to Luanda, the capital of Angola, used to be one of British Airways’ most profitable, ferrying people involved in the country’s lucrative oil and diamond trades during a remarkable expansion of the city from 2002, after nearly three decades of civil war.In recent years it has competed with Hong Kong and Tokyo for the title of world’s most expensive city for expatriates. Cranes dominated the downtown skyline and homes in the surrounding areas were demolished to make way for Chinese-backed housing projects. Wealthy firms reportedly paid millions to fly in pop stars such as Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj for private concerts.In June British Airways closed the route, the latest sign of a downturn that has rocked the city since the price of oil began to crash in 2014. As inflation spiralled, new governors of the Angolan central bank have tried to rein in the local currency, the kwanza. Now there’s a currency shortage and a disparity in value on the black market, which is driving crime and medicine shortages.Despite this, Luanda continues to expand south and east from the south Atlantic Ocean. The city is home to a population of about 7.8 million, which the UN estimates will double by 2030, giving Luanda megacity status.Luanda is expensive to visit and visas for journalists are hard to come by. Government bureaucracy is obstructive and relentless, and the chance to document ordinary life relatively rare. Angola was once looked to with hope: having shaken off the yoke of colonial Portuguese rule in 1975, could it use its clean slate to put socialist principles into practice? Decades on, inequality is stark: wealth has been hoarded by the elite and the rights of ordinary citizens are trampled on. Many are forcibly evicted to create new developments where they can’t afford to live.In last year’s election, José Eduardo dos Santos, the president for almost four decades, was replaced by João Lourenço, a former defence minister. There appears to be some appetite for reform in parts of the new government: most notably, several lucrative contracts given to Isabel dos Santos, the former president’s daughter and Africa’s richest woman, were annulled by the new president.The modestly titled Epic Sana is a Luanda landmark, one of the city’s top luxury hotels located in the heart of the downtown district. During the oil boom it was teeming with business people oil companies used to block-book dozens of rooms for their employees. The hotel boasts several restaurants with chefs from Portugal sushi appears to be the current fad.Thanks to the economic crisis, the hotel is quieter these days. Some airlines and diamond companies put their staff up there, but the high-rollers have gone.These shanty homes in Zango, in the south of the city, belong to former farmers whose land was taken in 2006 for the housing development in the background. They were given a week’s notice. They have a constitutional right to compensation and rehousing, and were advised to stay close to the new development or risk being forgotten. But communication from officials and developers is poor, and the former residents have no certainty about their fate. Legal battles over rehousing can sometimes take more than a decade. SOS Habitat, a group supported by Christian Aid, works with those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.The Mangais golf resort is also in the city’s south, next to the Cuanza river, and is where rich locals and foreign businessmen spend their weekends. It is a surreal place – lush and green. During my visit, a group of Korean businessmen were playing a round, caddied by young men from the area. There was also a group of wealthy locals playing the women in the group seemed to have dressed up for the occasion.Nearly all of the men I met living at the Aiera Branca shanty village, to the south of the city, were fisherman. The man in the main photo is looking for worms among the plastic trash to use as bait. The men fish the black waters of the lagoon, with their children playing next to them.The child in the final photograph has pneumonia. There is a severe shortage of basic medicine that, years ago, would have been available at clinics. Now they can only be found on the black market and most people can’t afford them. Malaria has also become a huge problem, with infection rates rising alarmingly.Under the country’s constitution, people have the right to running water and electricity. Clearly there’s a disparity between the official promise and the reality, and that gap is where many ordinary Luandans are forced to live.A new housing development in Kilamba, to the south of the city, is one of many neighbourhoods constructed by Chinese developers. Existing homes were razed, with former residents offered spaces in the new buildings. In one development we visited, the rent was four times the average monthly wage. For a while developments like these lay empty, dubbed ghost towns. Now, they are beginning to be occupied by skilled professionals working for the government. By local standards, those people are wealthy.The Povoado bar is in the old neighbourhood of Bita, not far from Kilamba. It is the type of place most people earning normal wages can head to on a Friday or Saturday night to unwind without breaking the bank. Kizomba music blares from its speakers – it is the most popular modern Angolan dance music. It became a craze in French-speaking countries and parts of South America.In the city centre there are upmarket nightclubs such as Docks, where the wealthy go. During the boom years, business was good here. But they are feeling the financial squeeze now too.Luanda has a crime problem. It is difficult to get any official statistics, but everyone talks about frequent armed robberies. There are a lot of weapons around, mostly AK-47s left over from the civil war. At the time, they were handed out to people to defend themselves.I went out with a police patrol on a Friday night. They would stop cars, searching for weapons or drugs, or to see if the driver had been drinking. I noticed the police always travelled in groups at night. One man they stopped was a bit affronted and asked why he had been stopped generally though, people seemed to be polite and wary of the police, but not intimidated by them.Ilha do Cabo is the real heart of the city, where everyone goes to relax: rich, poor, homeless. It is mostly a weekend spot, but during the week you might find students having picnics or celebrating a birthday. Further up from where these pictures were taken, there are expensive beachfront bars and restaurants that largely cater to expats. Everything they serve is imported from Europe – apart from the beer.Interview by Aidan Mac GuillFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55ebf0e85b7bbc08228adeb5c4e1c3d4fc024021/0_288_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=192ca901a65c9a9df8455916d5f9e902","title":"from snake soup to sorcery the street traders of hong kong in pictures","story":"Many of Hong Kong’s traditional street trades are on the verge of dying out.

Some, including this newspaper, have suggested that if a second referendum were to happen, a way forward could be for the UK to follow the model adopted by Ireland to try and break the stalemate over an emotive issue that had dogged its politics for decades: abortion.We wanted to find out from Irish citizens why they felt the assembly helped to bring about consensus. Here’s what some of them said.Dee, works in education, County Louth Abortion has long been considered politically toxic in Ireland, with our elected representatives loth to touch it in case it alienated their constituents and risked their political careers. The Citizens’ Assembly took the debate out of this realm of fearful self-interested calculation and into a forum where evidence and experience could take centre stage. Interest in the workings of the assembly meant that the media could report on this evidence, leading to a better-informed public and lessening the hysteria that circulates around debates based on dogma. It led to a growing realisation that the 8th amendment affected people in a wide variety of ways even during wanted pregnancies, and revealed the chilling effect it had on medical professionals’ ability to provide necessary healthcare. The members of the assembly were faced with expert testimony on medical and legal matters but also testimony from their fellow citizens whose lives were deeply impacted by the 8th.It meant that there was a long lead-in to the referendum during which debate was reasoned and detailed, before the inevitable agitation of the campaign itself. The fact that it was citizens who recommended the terms of the referendum and informed the proposed legislation introduced greater clarity, and meant voters did not just have to trust politicians since a representative body of their fellow citizens had carefully reflected on the matter and recommended these changes following significant education and deep reflection on the situation. I think the success of the Citizens’ Assembly is evidenced by the fact that the proportion in favour of repeal mirrored so closely the final vote.I was initially very sceptical. The previous discussions on abortion were rife with emotion, and the country was very ided. I was dreading the decisive nature of what I thought was a cop-out. However, I was completely wrong. Issues were discussed logically and with complete transparency and fairness. The result was a revelation in many ways. The extreme for and against arguments were shown to be just that: extreme arguments. The plain, simple facts were what mattered and brought logic to an apparently intractable issue.It is an unbeatable process. I think it would have helped the whole Brexit process had it been followed. However, Ireland had to go through years of hell to finally use it. A shame that our friends and neighbours did not follow it, but then a nation has to have its own learning curve.The Citizens’ Assembly meant the discussion about our abortion laws was led by the people rather than politicians. It’s interesting to see international interest in it, as at the time a lot of people felt it was set up as a way of kicking the can down the road. An awful lot of people against the 8th amendment were calling for the assembly to be scrapped and wanted an immediate referendum. The sentiment was understandable but I personally felt it would have been incredibly irresponsible and undemocratic to hold a referendum on revoking the 8th amendment without having proposed legislation as to what would go in its place. It is absolutely critical that people understand what it is they are voting for.Crucially, a citizens’ assembly is non-partisan and so it creates a people-led discussion and understanding of an issue. I think this also helps create a debate that isn’t dominated by black-and-white mantras from political parties but a more nuanced discussion of the issue in question. Furthermore, politics can feel far removed from the average person and so the discussion and findings can feel far more relatable.There was no trouble accessing the assembly findings as every time they met, the national TV channel, the newspapers and online-only news forums comprehensively reported the assembly’s activities. Unless you chose to stick your head in the clouds, you could not avoid hearing or reading about the assembly. This was not done in an overbearing way, as initially the assembly met once a month, so you were content to tune in to update yourself. I feel this was very important for people who never would have considered voting in favour of abortion. It motivated young people to vote for a subject very important to them, and opened up debate among people in general. The greatest thing the assembly did was get balanced and truthful information out among the people of Ireland.A citizens’ assembly has revealed itself to me to be a vital tool in a democracy – it takes the debating of a contentious issue right back down into the hands of people on the electoral roll. This is great as our politicians are so often tied into a certain viewpoint based on political agenda, party politics or personal gain. I feel a citizens’ assembly would be a very helpful tool in the Brexit dilemma.The assembly facilitated the presentation of a whole range of views and insights on the topic. The media coverage of presentations triggered a lot of discussion. Expert input at the forum informed public opinion and thus facilitated greater understanding of the issues at play in crisis pregnancies. For many, the revelation that abortion pills could be bought on the internet was a game changer. Clearly, women taking such pills without medical supervision are seriously imperilled. The realisation that abortion was already reasonably prevalent in our society led people to see that it is best for society to accept its reality and provide for safe provision under medical care.The Citizens’ Assembly, with due thanks to its chair, provided a forum where the real story was told. The broad spectrum of experience, case histories and moral viewpoints was set out for evaluation and consideration. Misrepresentation was not an option, for proponents or opponents. There was no “bluster bus”. If there is a second Brexit referendum, it should be preceded by a citizens’ assembly, chaired by an experienced judge and supported by an expert team of fact checkers.It felt very democratic. All sides were addressed. It very much helped me – not to decide as I already knew how I was voting, but to listen, understand and develop empathy for those who planned to vote the other way. The issue was a very complex and isive one, and the Citizens’ Assembly helped the issue be seen from all sides. This is not a simple issue of right or wrong. Interpersonal discussions on the issue often became emotional, leading to them becoming deadlocked. The Citizens’ Assembly kept information flowing whether we liked to hear it or not.

He wanted to scrap our nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war. So it should be no surprise that he insists Britain should unilaterally disarm in its negotiations with the EU. That is what his demand that Theresa May take no deal off the table means. If we rule out leaving with no withdrawal agreement, we would have to accept whatever terms the EU dictates. Whatever the price tag (£39bn is just for starters), whatever the loss of control over our borders and laws, however great the humiliation – we would have to accept it to avoid no deal.What is surprising is that the CBI apparently agrees with Corbyn’s unilateralism. It, too, wants to abandon the option of leaving with no withdrawal agreement on 29 March. Yet would a single successful business in this country enter into negotiations with a customer or merger partner without being prepared to walk away without a deal if it could not get a satisfactory one?Moreover, if a director publicly said during negotiations that the firm could not walk away without an agreement, they would be sacked for undermining the firm’s bargaining position.Yet that is what the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and Greg Clark have done – most recently in their briefing of 300 business leaders – thereby weakening May’s bargaining position. Of course, the CBI (to which so few businesses belong that it refuses to reveal how many direct members it has) is led by bureaucrats, most of whom have never run a business in their lives and whose track record on policy is lamentable. It warned that it would be a disaster not to join the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), a disaster to leave the ERM and a disaster not to join the euro.A real businessman I spoke to recently was despairing of the CBI approach. He gave a vivid example of how essential it was to be ready – and seen by your negotiating partner to be ready – to walk away with no deal. Having discovered an offshore oilfield, he had to negotiate a contract with the only nearby pipeline company to bring the oil ashore. The company thought he had no alternative so demanded an exorbitant fee. He therefore not only declared that he was prepared to build his own pipeline but hired headhunters to recruit people to build it. Word reached the pipeline company and a reasonable deal was negotiated. The businessman said: “The £20k we spent on headhunters was the best investment I ever made – it showed I was prepared to walk away.”So, let’s not begrudge a few million spent on preparing to leave with no withdrawal agreement. Those preparations may prove unnecessary – but only because they persuade the EU to agree a last-minute withdrawal agreement shorn of the intolerable backstop and commitment to pay £39bn for nothing in return.Of course, it would be best to agree a Canada-style free trade deal (which Donald Tusk offered in March and again in October) so that we can continue to trade with the EU with zero tariffs. But we must be prepared to leave on WTO terms if the EU will not revert to a free trade deal immediately.Leaving on WTO terms has three big positives. First, we keep £39bn – we would be cashing in not crashing out. Second, we would end the corrosive economic and political uncertainty that would otherwise grind on for more than two years. Third, we would force Ireland, the UK and the EU to resolve the Irish border issue by administrative means, without checks at the border – as all have said they will do if we leave without a withdrawal agreement. This would clear the way for a Canada-style deal covering the whole of the UK.Moreover, it is increasingly obvious that the supposed downsides of leaving with no withdrawal agreement have been exaggerated or eliminated.Most of the scares about shortages of medicines, food etc assumed there would be delays at Dover or Calais. But HMRC says it will carry out roughly the same number of checks as at present because checks relate to the risk of smuggling drugs and cigarettes, and illegal immigrants – none of which will increase post Brexit. Moreover, it will “prioritise flow over compliance” and wave vehicles through even if their customs declarations are incomplete.Now the Calais port chairman has claimed that Calais will have no more checks than at present. He says he is confident that traffic will flow freely. The port is installing three extra lorry lanes, an inspection post for animals away from the port, and a scanner for trains moving at 30kmh.And it is indignant that the British government is – unnecessarily in its view – hiring ferries to take trade to other ports.The EU itself has removed other fears. It is legislating that planes will fly, lorries will get licences, Airbus can export its wings, and that live animals and animal products will be “swiftly” allowed entry. This is all subject to the UK reciprocating. It could be described as a “managed no deal”.Many of those urging us to reject the option of leaving with no withdrawal agreement know it would, as Aneurin Bevan warned of unilateral nuclear disarmament, mean sending British ministers “naked into the conference chamber”. But they want us to be forced to accept such humiliating terms that Britain might choose to return with its tail between its legs to beg to be allowed to stay in the EU. They misjudge the resolve of the British people.• Lord Lilley is a former Conservative MP who was trade and industry secretary from 1990 to 1992"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56a8a8314da840c6df1e946c787aebb672389723/362_769_4643_2786/master/4643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afaaf0d4aae0b81a363ee809abcb88d1","title":"i resent the job for life notion why everyone wants a side hustle","story":"Apparently, the age of the side hustle is upon us, but just what is it? And why should we care? Author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, Emma Gannon, explainsAlex Haddow, a comedian and picture editor, agrees: “I feel that by doing lots of things that pique my interest all the time, I get the most out of everything,” she says. “And because that keeps my interest up, I put more into them and get better results.”At the same time, the internet has given us access to a myriad of free tools and a huge global audience of potential customers and clients, whether using e-commerce hubs such as ebay, or building a following via social media – making many business ideas more viable than before. Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work. After all, says Sarah Kingston, writer, consultant and owner of a marketing agency: “I get to be creative, challenged and excited about what I do. Why have one job title when I can have three?”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Imagine that someone in power outlined a plan to work with the public, parents, teachers, heads and governors to establish common values for the education system.The architects of the plan would provide extra cash to implement any changes required by this shared endeavour, aimed at securing continuous improvement while reducing inequality, supporting staff and addressing workload issues. Unrealistic?Except this is not a dream. Earlier this month a 10-year plan was published for the National Health Service based on exactly these principles. It received a cautious welcome, though with inevitable and genuine concern about adequate resourcing.What is clear from the glaring contrast between the visions for these two key public sectors is that education is rapidly becoming a Cinderella service. Far from being energised by a long-term strategic vision, it is drifting towards bankruptcy, chronic staff shortages and serious concern about the ability to maintain standards.It would be interesting another time to delve into how we arrived at this point. Why does the health service hold a sacred place in the hearts of the public and politicians, while education does not? It is a critical problem that the invisible double act of Damian Hinds and Angela Rayner (secretary of state and his shadow) appear to be doing little to address. Hinds has a slim excuse in that swathes of his department have been switched to no-deal Brexit planning.What little resource is left at the Department for Education is presumably dealing with the fallout from his predecessors’ reforms. But as far as funding cuts are concerned, the music stopped on his watch. It was only after being pressed by the education select committee last week that Hinds acknowledged similar long-term funding for schools might be a good idea.And I am not sure what Labour’s excuse would be. The party’s leadership on one hand claims the country urgently needs a general election, while on the other, offers few concrete proposals about how it would use power transformatively.Its National Education Service, still in barely skeleton form four years after it was announced, would provide an obvious starting point to compare to the government’s long-term planning for the NHS.But a recent analysis of prime minister’s questions shows that last year Jeremy Corbyn didn’t include a single question about education, confirming suspicions it isn’t a subject that interests him much.Meanwhile, Labour appears, from its website at least, to be launching yet another education consultation in addition to the one it carried out last year. The permanent canvassing of opinion in the name of party democracy has become a fig leaf to avoid making difficult decisions.But if the National Education Service is to match the NHS in the public’s hearts and imaginations, work needs to start now. Hard questions need answering. How to resolve the chaotic part-academy, part-maintained school hybrid and lack of adequate school sponsors caused by Michael Gove’s frantic shake-up? How to mitigate the impact of a competitive high-stakes accountability on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable – the correlation between exclusion and knife crime alone should be a red warning light. Perhaps most pressingly, how to develop high-status vocational education in the light of any post-Brexit needs.Excellent, equitable health and education provision should be in any civilised country’s DNA, the twin pillars of a socially cohesive society at ease with itself. The events of the last few years may cause many of us to doubt whether the UK can now comfortably see itself in that light.But we can aspire to heal the isions that austerity and Brexit have fostered. Any investment in the NHS is welcome, but condemning education to a second-tier priority is shortsighted, cowardly and counterproductive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd830158bdfe64b09169c8f903f211c73710e7a4/0_249_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b37622faa9b33a4da7d5b232c75258da","title":"what to do when studying abroad goes wrong","story":"It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but what happens when studying in a different country isn’t all it’s cracked up to be?The year abroad is a compulsory element of most modern languages degrees in the UK. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel, make new friends, and make old ones jealous. Except my own time in Spain and Paraguay turned out to be more difficult than my final exams the following year. Of course, students who get the change to study abroad should be grateful for the fantastic opportunity, and I don’t suggest anyone should feel sorry for them. But here’s my advice if the year abroad happens not to be the time of your life.First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. I’ve lost count of the number of people I know who spent the first few months feeling like a failure for not immediately acclimatising to their new surroundings. When you’re no longer a tourist people speak to you faster, don’t disguise regional accents, and often interact with you in large social groups, all of which might leave you feeling like you don’t speak the language as well as you thought you did. It’s also surprising how exhausting thinking in another language all day can be.Secondly, keep an eye on your social media consumption. While the internet is a blessing for keeping up with friends and family, it can be intensely lonely to scroll through the feeds of others abroad, or your friends still together back home. “A massive piece of advice I’d give is to not place too much importance on how you think other people are experiencing the year abroad,” says Ellie Hill, who went to Italy and Paraguay. “Especially when social media is involved.”Studies show the worst thing you can do on social media for your mental health is use it a lot but not post yourself. As an experiment, during a low point on my year abroad I posted a snap of the local countryside to Instagram. I was astonished by the amount of comments from friends about how amazing my new life was, and how jealous they were. This didn’t make me feel any better, but realising how different the social media image of my life was to the reality reduced the envy I felt of my friends’ posts. It’s easy to forget that people only display the good parts.Finally, think seriously about whether you want to stay where you are. Most students find the year abroad difficult in one way or another, and the majority get through it and come out the other side better for the experience. But there can come a point when staying in a situation that doesn’t suit you starts to seriously impact your mental health, and in that case it’s worth checking out your options.“If you’re unhappy on your year abroad and it’s because of the place, you are free to change your plans,” says Eleanor Fawcett, who worked with a group of other Cambridge students to create a guide to finding support during the year abroad. “I left Paris much earlier than planned and moved to Russia. The faculty supported me financially and allowed me to change my plans.”Many universities have guidelines for what happens in this situation, but they don’t tend to be made clear to students. It’s worth emailing your course or year abroad coordinator to ask about your options for finishing a placement early or changing to a different one. As Beth Craig-Geen, who studied in Jordan, says: “Never be afraid to change your plans or make decisions to protect your mental health. Changing things isn’t a failure – it’s a success, because it shows you’re looking after yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce9fab464a90581592825ac487d5fcc1028e72b0/0_153_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30276569b17c9a3ac2ad3d983dc97df2","title":"fracking polluted kirby misperton yorkshire","story":"Lorries, demonstrators and police drive up air pollution in Kirby Misperton, study findsA shale gas company’s lorries, police vehicles and protesters’ wood fires have combined to drive up air pollution levels near a gas well in the north of England, despite fracking failing to get started at the site.Operations at the Kirby Misperton well in North Yorkshire have been delayed after the operator Third Energy ran into financial problems, but the project’s local pollution impact has been revealed by government-backed research.Alastair Lewis, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York, said his air quality monitoring project found a group of pollutants had increased in the vicinity of the site to levels normally seen in a city rather than a rural area.The cause was lorries supplying the well, opposition by campaigners and the resulting police operation.“The largest, most visible detectable impacts above the surface are on nitrogen oxides (NOx), from the use of compressors, generators and truck movements,” Lewis said.He said protest tactics such as slow walking in front of lorries supplying the site would have driven up NOx levels, and police vehicles had been a “significant” source of the pollutants.North Yorkshire police spent more than £600m on policing protests at the site over the autumn and winter of 2017-18.Lewis said monitoring had also detected particulate pollution that he expected had come from the burning of wood by protest camps.He said the overall air quality impact of the site had been akin to a single supermarket.“It kind of shifted a semi-rural location into a chemical environment that looked more similar to a city suburban environment for NOx,” Lewis said, but he added that the levels did not breach regulatory limits.

This was the first occasion on which Lagerfeld, who was well enough to travel to New York where he appeared on stage after a show in December, has missed a catwalk bow. Even by the blockbuster standards of a Chanel show, this was a dramatic morning in Paris. Not content with creating a summer garden in January for the interior of the show, Lagerfeld and his team had dialled up the contrast by organising a picturesque snowfall to descend with perfect timing outside, carpeting the steps of the Grand Palais in white, heightening the impact of the summery oasis built inside. Like a Marvel blockbuster, Chanel combines creativity with technical brilliance to make the impossible become possible. There was a party dress on this catwalk embroidered in real flowers preserved in resin to last forever. (The price tag of a dress such as this simply does not exist, although a six-figure bill would follow.) The blue sky of the trompe l’oeil cyclorama that transformed the Grand Palais into an Italianate villa was painted, but the orange trees dotted around the swimming pool were the real thing rented from nurseries in the countryside outside Paris, they will return to their original state after the show, like Cinderella’s carriage turning back into a pumpkin.The Villa Chanel, as it was called on invitations, was an opulent setting based on La Vigie, a Monte Carlo house at which Lagerfeld summered in the 1980s. Not that these were clothes much suited for lazing on sunloungers – the show opened with a series of pale tweed suits with long pencil skirts. The height of the models emphasised by piled-up beehives, the silhouette was as elegant and imposing as the cypress trees lining the pool.After a detour into Jay Gatsby’s West Egg mansion via feathered boleros and daisy-strewn gowns, the show wound its way into a 1950s mood. The boleros were replaced by cropped leather jackets, the feathers by Pink Lady satins.Lace dresses in the classic Corolla shape of 1950s couture, with a minimal corseted bustier and a full, slightly tulip-shaped skirt were stitched from lace so airy and light that the models seemed to float along the catwalk. The bridal outfit, which traditionally closes every haute couture show, was a sequinned swimsuit with a sweeping veil attached to an embroidered swimcap. Lagerfeld, who began his career as an assistant to Pierre Balmain in 1955, joined Chanel in 1983. In his first season, he was reported to be “working 16 hours a day and delighted to do it”.In a record-breaking 36 years at the house, he has succeeded in making Coco Chanel an even more famous and more central character in the story of fashion than she was during her lifetime. Chanel has two upcoming catwalk shows: one during the ready-to-wear collections in early March and another on 3 May. All eyes will be on who takes the end bow.

On the contrary: the humble jumper proved to be the backbone of the shows, and how you wear yours speaks volumes about your style. The big decision is whether you wear it tight and tucked or long and loose. The former means you’re in the Vetements and Acne camp and strikes a caredon’t-care-meets-90s-throwback note. The latter says you have a laissez-faire approach and like art galleries – see Loewe’s knits, which came beautifully beaded and also featured intarsia. The third way to update your jumper game is to wear one in lieu of a shirt with a suit, as seen at Hermès. Très chic.If you’re a fully paid-up member of the navy brigade, this one’s not for you. If, however, you’re not afraid to embrace your inner wild child, there are the only two words you need to know from the shows: leopard print. Taking a leaf out of the Kurt Cobain stylebook, Marni, Raf Simons and No 21 put leopard-print coats on the catwalk. Versace went one step further and matched a model’s head to his hide. If the full look is a step too far, introduce the print through a pair of shoes (as seen at Celine) or a statement shirt. The latter will tick another trend box: Prada, Dior, Iceberg and Per Götesson all made a case for bold button-ups.The extra-long scarf is to next winter what the snood is to this, so get ahead of the game. While this item is as accessible and perennial as they come, the styling footnote must be adhered to in order to get the look. As seen at Sunnei, JW Anderson (both at his own brand and Loewe) and Rochas, it should be thrown asymmetrically over one shoulder in a haphazard way. (Think less Daniel Ratcliffe as Harry Potter, more Richard E Grant as Withnail.)Hiking, toe-cap, gum, duck and Ugg boots are all fashion-week-approved, which is good news for two reasons. Firstly, if you’ve got a pair of heavyweight boots in the back of a cupboard somewhere, you’re quids in. Secondly, if you do invest in a pair, they’ll double up as walkingfishingworkingwarm boots, and so again you’re quids in. For style notes, look to Ermenigeldo Zegna, where the boots were heavy-duty but still slick Berluti, where they were angular with metal caps Jacquemus, where they were lace-up and galosh-like and Heron Preston, which collaborated with Ugg to create the cosiest of slip-ons. H\u0026ampM’s collaboration with Eytys, which has a couple of excellently priced options that launch this week.Give your biker, aviator and bomber jackets a little rest: the trophy piece to emerge from the shows is a black tailored butter-soft leather blazer. Tom Ford, No21, Marni, Paul Smith, Prada, Versace and Off-White all got the memo, and theirs came single-breasted and smooth, with peak lapels and a 90s sensibility. For moodboard inspiration, look to Al Pacino’s Carlito Brigante in Carlito’s Way from 1993, Lenny Kravitz promoting his Circus album in 1996, and Brad Pitt, off-duty, at practically any point in that decade. A caveat: unless you have one already, your best bet is eBay until post-show production swings into action.Bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better – except that it does when it comes to bags this year. It’s time to reject micro and bumbags that can’t even carry the bare essentials, and become a turtle once more. Prada, A Cold Wall and Emporio Armani’s catwalks featured models making the case for more is more, while Louis Vuitton took up the most room with enormous woollen backpacks. Sat front row at his show was Frank Ocean, who is already ahead of the trend. He clutched an extra-large tote at his side at several of the shows.Suits are officially the new streetwear (which used to be the new suit). Thanks to Kim Jones at Dior, Hedi Slimane at Celine, Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Kriss Van Assche at Berluti, beautiful tailoring is back on the agenda, and it can be worn myriad ways. It needn’t be straight-laced: Charles Jeffrey used tartan for his Loverboy range Clare Waight Keller crafted two-tone wool tweeds and gem-stone-hued styles and Dries Van Noten went tie-dye.

This also has 10 nominations, including of course a best actress nomination for Olivia Colman, who this year has become (justly) catapulted to international treasure status. (An upgrade from national to international treasure status might also be due for Richard E Grant, who has a best supporting actor nomination for his venal Brit boozehound in Can You Ever Forgive Me?) These are the prestige products, the blue-chip movies that the Academy hivemind has decided are the headline successes.As for the snubs, complaining about these has evolved to such an extent in recent years that they have become the pundits’ alternative refusenik fantasy league. But the lack of women directors in the best picture and best director lists is woeful, at least partly because they exclude one of the very best films: Debra Granik’s superb Leave No Trace. There is also the exclusion of Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, her excellent variation on the Taxi Driver theme starring Joaquin Phoenix. Barry Jenkins’s fine If Beale Street Could Talk has been largely overlooked, although I am confident that Regina King will win best supporting actress for her delicate, intelligently judged performance in that movie. Nicole Kidman deserved a shot at an Oscar for her very interesting performance in Destroyer, and Steve McQueen’s terrific thriller Widows is turning into this awards season’s Cinderella, bafflingly excluded from ball after ball. The biggest and most deplorable snub was however that Ari Aster’s brilliant scary movie Hereditary received nothing: with a lead performance from the wonderful Toni Collette which could go toe-to-toe with any of the current contenders.Bubbling under the big two are the more middleweightcommercial contenders: eight nominations for Adam McKay’s flashy satire Vice, with its entertaining latexed turn from Christian Bale as Bush-era vice-president Dick Cheney. Eight nominations also for Bradley Cooper’s terrific new sugar-rush version of A Star Is Born, which I continue to think is one of the very best films of the year, despite some medium-sized reservations raised elsewhere more of a sidelash than a backlash. But I should now concede a minor fault in this film which I should have spotted from the beginning. It is of course — I admit it — highly implausible that Lady Gaga’s character should be so against taking pictures of celebs on mobile phones in the real world, an ambitious singer-songwriter like her would be selfie-ing, Instagramming, SoundClouding etc non-stop.The 91st Academy awards take place on 24 February at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles.

The liberal whiteblack balance narrative has not found universal favour, Don Shirley’s surviving relatives have complained about inaccuracies contrived, evidently, in the services of this fifty-fifty approach and nominee Ali was reported to have remarked: “I did the best I could with the material I had” — which has to be the most self-deprecating personal publicity campaign in the history of the Academy Awards.Hilariously, the Freddie Mercury feelgood biopic Bohemian Rhapsody continues on its triumphal progress with five nods, including one for its undeniably impressive turn from Rami Malek – and very much none for its disgraced credited director Bryan Singer, who unrepentantly posted a “thank you” message on Instagram after its Golden Globes success in which he, again, did not personally participate. There is an excellent chance of Bohemian Rhapsody converting some of these nominations into wins and indeed of Singer embarrassing the industry again with another pointed thankbrag on social media.And what of the wunderkind Damien Chazelle? His First Man, a very stirring, if conservative account of Neil Armstrong and the moon landing, starring Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, has picked up four nominations, but is not predicted to trouble the scorer much, or at all, on the night. There’s no doubt about it: First Man somehow hasn’t got the momentum. Can this really be because of a dirty-tricks social media campaign to signal-boost Republican complaints about Chazelle failing to show the American flag being planted on the moon? Stranger things have happened.The best actor race is anyone’s guess. Almost any of the contenders could win: and it could even be Willem Dafoe’s year for his straightforwardly earnest portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh in Julian Schnabel’s At Eternity’s Gate. Christian Bale could pinch it for his Dick Cheney, perhaps because the Hollywood establishment is nostalgicallymasochistically yearning for a rightwing Republican bad guy of the pre-Trump old school. Bradley Cooper is great in A Star Is Born. Only snobs deny it.As for lead actress, this has to be Glenn Close’s year. Her performance as the enigmatically reserved wife of the conceited Saul Bellow-style Nobel laureate novelist is a high-IQ treat. But every one of the other nominees (including Colman, Roma’s Yalitza Aparicio, Gaga in A Star Is Born and most interestingly the outstanding Melissa McCarthy in Can You Ever Forgive Me?) is entirely plausible.Elsewhere, the director’s list is interesting. Spike Lee actually makes his debut as a director for BlacKkKlansman (his 1990 nomination for Do the Right Thing was as a screenwriter). Lee is an extremely popular nominee and he could well win this category, despite the heavy-hitter competition from Pawel Pawlikowski, Cuarón, McKay and Lanthimos.The nearest thing to a shoo-in of this Oscar season, apart from Regina King, has to be Free Solo in the documentary list, a gasp-inducing study of Alex Honnold who climbs terrifyingly high rock faces without a rope. It is, however, disappointing that Tim Wardle’s Three Identical Strangers didn’t make it onto this list, or indeed Peter Jackson’s marvellous first world war film They Shall Not Grow Old. Also, many will have been hoping that Joe Pearlman and David Soutar’s Bros: After the Screaming Stops might have got a nomination. If that had won, the Goss brothers could have got up on the Oscar stage and sentimentally demonstrated their boyhood “dart-throwing” game.The other clear shoo-in is Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse for animation — a film which is witty, freaky and mind-bending and probably the best superhero film of all time.An intriguing, and wide-open Oscar race.

Roma’s success demonstrates the Oscars’ acceptance of streaming giant Netflix, which it had had hitherto treated with suspicion. Netflix has launched an expensive awards campaign which appears to be have paid off.Scabrous period comedy The Favourite, about political power games at the 18th-century court of Queen Anne, also received 10 nominations, including best actress for Olivia Colman. With 12 Bafta nominations, and a single Golden Globe win for Colman (for the best actress, musical or comedy), The Favourite emerged as a much liked contender as awards season has progressed, and a powerful vehicle for its cast, which includes Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, who were both nominated for best supporting actress.A Star is Born, Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut about a waning country icon and the unknown singer (played by Lady Gaga) he mentors, picked up eight nominations. The film, which premiered at the Venice film festival last August, began awards season as frontrunner, before losing momentum. It secured best actor and actress nominations for Cooper and Gaga, as well as best picture and best song, but was surprisingly passed over for best director.Also on eight nominations is Vice, the comedy about Dick Cheney, vice president to George W Bush and architect of the war on terror. Christian Bale is nominated for best actor as Cheney, Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor as Bush, and Amy Adams for best supporting actress as Lynne Cheney. Bale was a popular winner of the best actor, musical or comedy, at the Golden Globes, where he thanked Satan as an inspiration for his performance.The 91st Academy awards take place on 24 February at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles.

Directed by Ryan Coogler, the film has won a string of awards, including movie of the year from the MTV Movie awards, and was expected to be the main beneficiary of the proposed “best popular film” category proposed by the Academy. However, the plan was cancelled after industry figures complained it patronised commercially successful films.Firebrand film-maker Spike Lee received his first nomination for best director for his police drama BlacKkKlansman, which stars John David Washington as a detective who helps infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. Lee was given an honorary Oscar in 2015, and BlacKkKlansman received six nominations in total, including best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Adam Driver.However, no women have been nominated in the best director category, with Lynne Ramsay, Debra Granik and Chloe Zhao overlooked for You Were Never Really Here, Leave No Trace and The Rider respectively, all of which have performed well on critics’ lists and independent-film awards. This means that only one woman – Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird in 2018 – has been nominated for the award since Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win it in 2010 for The Hurt Locker.Green Book, the early Oscar frontrunner about the burgeoning friendship between African American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) scored a disappointing five nominations, including best picture and best supporting actor for Ali. Its awards campaign has become dogged by controversy, after the film’s director Peter Farrelly apologised for sexual harassment and co-writer Nick Vallelonga apologised for an anti-Muslim tweet he sent in 2015. However, Green Book still remains a strong contender, especially after winning the key Producers’ Guild award.Bohemian Rhapsody, the hit biopic of Freddie Mercury and Queen, emerged unexpectedly strongly from the Golden Globes, where it won best drama and best actor, drama, for Rami Malek. It has continued its successful streak at the Oscars, with five nominations, including best picture and Malek up for best actor. Its credited director Bryan Singer, who left the production in controversial circumstances before the end of filming, has not been nominated.First Man, which stars Ryan Gosling as astronaut Neil Armstrong, was considered a safe bet for Oscar success when it was first premiered at Venice, with La La Land director Damien Chazelle behind the camera and support from The Crown’s Claire Foy as Armstrong’s wife Janet. It came up short at the Golden Globes with two nominations (one of which was for Foy) and one win, for its score. It now receives four nominations for the Oscars, none of which are in the headline categories.Black Sheep, a short film commissioned by the , received a nomination for best short documentary. Free to view on the  website, it describes the lengths that a black 11-year-old, Cornelius Walker, went to to fit in with a racist gang after his family moved away from London.For only the second time in their 91-year history, the Academy Awards will not have a host, after the resignation last December of Kevin Hart, following a backlash to re-emerged homophobic comments. Speculation had been rife that Hart would return to the role after he declared himself uninterested earlier this month, the Academy opted not to replace him and instead opt for a rolling cast of A-list presenters.Key awards ceremonies still to come before the Oscars include the Screen Actors Guild awards on 27 January and the Baftas on 10 February.This year’s ceremony will take place on 24 February in the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.If Beale Street Could Talk (Barry Jenkins) A Star Is Born (Bradley Cooper, Will Fetters and Eric Roth)Can You Ever Forgive Me?

What’s behind the sudden demise of entertainment’s biggest jobs?The loss of the Oscars’ latest host is, on the one hand, just another mishap to add to the list. From 2016’s #OscarsSoWhite to 2017’s wrong delivery of the best picture award, the ceremony now seems like a particularly slow bloopers reel. Yet the loss of Kevin Hart – who quit after old homophobic tweets resurfaced – is also a sign of something else. The fact that no one has replaced him, and that it’s difficult to think of many people who could, or would, reveals a much deeper malaise: a scary loss of nerve across showbiz’s top-tier events.Within weeks, the Super Bowl half-time show will air. In the past, the American football final has been an epic showcase for the likes of Madonna, Prince and Beyoncé, a 20-minute, legacy-defining megamix. This year, though, with Rihanna and Cardi B having turned it down in solidarity with the activist NFL player Colin Kaepernick, we will be left with the hardly epochal sounds of Maroon 5.A certain blandness seems to threaten all proceedings. Earlier this month the Golden Globes made do with the anodyne pairing of Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh as hosts, while the White House correspondents’ dinner – historically a raucous roast for America’s political class – has now asked a historian to host April’s televised event after the comedian Michelle Wolf was deemed to have taken last year’s proceedings too far.And now, for the first time in 30 years, the Oscars look set to have no official host. It’s rather worrying, not least because the last time this happened, in 1989, an infamous debacle ensued – a strange opening number involving Snow White, Rob Lowe and a rendition of I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.This confusion is one place where the Oscars can claim a type of relevance, although not the type it wants. As its TV audience has dwindled, the Academy has tried to shake things up by hiring a variety of “edgy” hosts. Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Seth Macfarlane, the bizarre pairing of James Franco and Anne Hathaway: you can’t say they haven’t tried. But the reception has been lukewarm.At first, Hart seemed the ideal host, especially as he was one of the few who had actively campaigned for it. Yet his uncovered tweets from 10 years ago – in which he called someone “fat-faced fag” – created a furore. It’s a distinctly 2019 scenario.Not that it’s unclear why Hart had to go. But there remains the fundamental problem that any compere is expected to be edgy, but not too edgy. There’s a line, but no one quite knows where it lies. Perhaps the clearest example is Ricky Gervais’s stint at the Golden Globes, which drew both cackles and gasps when he did three in a row from 2010-12 (and again, less controversially, in 2016).Gags about Angelina Jolie’s brood of kids or Robert Downey Jr’s stints in rehab delighted some and disgusted others. Oddly, that degree of brazenness now seems a relic of another time. “As much as I dislike Ricky Gervais, there was something kind of fun about his run,” says Abramovitch (who found Samberg and Oh “completely forgettable”). “I think that era is over – people are too sensitive now. But the danger of it was fun.”The loose expectation of an awards host is to act as a court jester among showbusiness royalty, poking fun at their foibles. The problem is that these events thrive on a sense of their own prestige, so it doesn’t do to jest too much. And this is the age of “wokeness”, where people – particularly that crucial younger audience – are more conscious of gags revolving around gender, sexuality and race.“I think it’s a generational thing,” says Abramovitch, who is 46. “With my generation, it was still OK to poke some things, but the millennial generation are a lot more sensitive. It’s hard for them to understand context or satire.” Not that he thinks it is all political correctness gone mad. “This reckoning that’s happening, it’s all good.”When causing offence is almost inevitable, it takes a strong stomach to want to give it a go. I spoke, on condition of anonymity, to an events organiser who helps put together an important awards ceremony in London. “I’ve found it trickier to find a host this year,” they said. “You want a big name – but they don’t need to do it.” The reasons for hosting an event have changed, the organiser suggests: comedians have other platforms to showcase their talents. Often they don’t need the money. And yes, there is the danger of saying the wrong thing. “You have to be so careful, don’t you? Because the backlash can be extreme.”In Britain, even the dependable Bafta hosts Graham Norton and Stephen Fry have landed in hot water for jokes deemed too rude. Perhaps it just shows that you can never please everyone, and possibly also that camp – such a good way of saying naughty things politely – cannot cover for every sin. Nevertheless, the UK’s culture wars still seem less savage than in America, where things have ramped up since a certain reality TV star was elected president in 2016.“Trump is trying to destroy popular culture,” Kornhaber says. The “monoculture”, that sense of all of us enjoying mainstream events together, has already been frayed by the rise of the internet. But this is something Trump has only accentuated, says Kornhaber: “He has actually gone of out of his way to play up the cultural ides.”This attitude applies to everything from the Super Bowl to the Oscars to the White House correspondents’ dinner: Trump’s persona is anti-establishment, and there’s nothing he loves more than blasting a Hollywood system that long mocked and ignored him. His battles with the NFL, for instance, which is in dispute with the footballer Kaepernick, who in turn is regularly attacked by Trump, is a perfect storm of sports, race, showbiz and politics. Similarly, Trump has managed to toxify the issue whenever “any comedian makes a joke about him in a high-profile forum”, points out Kornhaber. “It becomes this fake debate about decorum and how to respect the president, because the president is firing back.”The Super Bowl has always had a problem when its performers get too racy – consider the vitriol around Janet Jackson’s 2004 “wardrobe malfunction”. Where awards ceremonies struggle with humour, the half-time show struggles with the typical rock’n’roll tropes of sex and rebellion. Yet it’s striking when a superstar like Rihanna decides she would rather pass on a potential TV audience of 150 million. There is a whole other fanbase she would rather speak to and that reminds us just how fragmented the cultural conversation has become.We saw a symptom of this in 2016, when Coldplay’s bland set suddenly featured a guest spot from Beyoncé, in what seemed to be an all-black Angela Davis tribute. It was two dissonant worldviews colliding, with only an Uptown Funk finale as a kind of glue. Cardi B could have done something similar with Maroon 5’s set this year. As it is, her fellow rapper Travis Scott is now scheduled to appear alongside the band, and is being hotly criticised for it.Which leads us to the White House correspondents’ dinner, a more niche event already widely begrudged for its tuxedoed cosying-up between Washington’s political elite and the fourth estate. Yet its dilemma could be the most telling. Last year Wolf took the traditional “roast” brief of the host seriously, giving Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, a thorough going-over, as the subject sat through it stony-faced. (Trump boycotts the dinner.) Wolf got a pasting, which has left many bemused. “They threw her under a bus,” says Abramovitch. “And now, when we need this more than ever, they’re wimping out and taking the safe route.”In the Trump era, though, many feel exhausted and trapped: hit back harder and you are just entrenching yourself don’t hit back at all and it’s a type of appeasement. What should be simple entertainment is now anything but. Perhaps the greatest story showbiz likes to tell is that we’re all one big happy family. In today’s vituperative climate, that’s a story no one wants to tell or hear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f9b213a389dccf5046083bf7908788defe5044d/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfa9824b11463957a3084bdab8ec4333","title":"the full list of nominations oscars 2019","story":"All the nominations for the 91st Academy Awards, which take place on 24 February at the Dolby theatre in HollywoodThe 91st Academy awards take place on 24 February at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles.

Continue cooking, stirring regularly, and then add 400g of cod cheeks.Roughly chop the leaves from 3 or 4 sprigs of parsley and stir in together with a light seasoning of salt and black pepper. Continue cooking for 3 or 4 minutes until the cheeks are cooked and the sauce is thick and brick red. Serve immediately. Enough for 2.Cod cheeks need very little cooking. Trim any silvery skin from them and cut them into spoon-sized pieces if they are particularly large. Use large tomatoes, but not beefsteak as they have a tendency to be watery. The dish is on the table in 10 minutes and is at its best served immediately.If cod cheeks remain elusive, you can use prawns, either shelled, or, if you are happy to get your fingers deliciously messy, in their shells. The cooking time will be the same, the cost considerably more.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/600dcbf98d68e862c3c6b52512de9b4afcf9a0ff/0_188_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5503bdba05143055fa1ed1e93ec8b522","title":"barcelona kevin prince boateng transfer planning","story":"Barcelona’s latest signing is football royalty, just not the way they expected. Late on Monday night, in the club store just across the concourse from the Camp Nou, closed to the public, he stood smiling and holding up his new shirt: “Prince, 19”. From Hertha to Tottenham, from Dortmund to Portsmouth and, five clubs and nine years later, from Sassuolo to Barcelona, Kevin-Prince Boateng’s 10th club is the biggest of them all. It was also the biggest surprise their new centre-forward comes from leftfield, unforeseen by anyone.Boateng described this as a huge “opportunity”. It is one he did not expect, echoes of the day that his agent told him he was going to Milan and Boateng thought he was joking. Some in Spain reacted similarly when the news broke with the deal already done. Boateng joins on loan, with an €8m optional purchase clause in the summer. The headlines in the Catalan papers came with exclamation marks. Boateng, the “hidden option”, “the surprise”, ran the front pages.Barcelona had been searching for a back-up striker, someone to take some of the pressure, and the minutes, off Luis Suárez. The criteria was clear and it limited their options: they wanted a player with experience and the personality to contribute from the start, but prepared to be substitute. Someone cheap too, although the cumulative effects of hurried deals costs. And someone who could leave as easily, and fuss-free as he arrived. A short-term solution to a specific problem, which could have been foreseen in the summer. Perhaps it should have been. What they didn’t foresee then was Antoine Griezmann opting to stay at Atlético.Last year’s Champions League defeat in Rome weighs on their minds, their great regret at the end of a season in which the won a domestic double which felt almost eclipsed by European failure. Suárez later admitted that he wished he had rotated more before that night and Barcelona have made no secret of the fact that they are desperate to win the Champions League. They felt they needed numbers, but also personality. When Munir El Haddadi departed, it underlined that they felt he was not the support striker they sought and so they turned to the market.Álvaro Morata had been offered but the cost was high and they remained unsure about his mid- to long-term fit. Cristhian Stuani seemed a perfect solution but his buy-out clause is €15m. The idea of bringing Carlos Vela back from the United States was discussed. Sights were being lowered, it seemed. In the end, it was Boateng who arrived from Sassuolo. His last club in Spain was Las Palmas. Just the names of those two clubs raise questions and naturally there are some doubts about his level, even if there is a willingness to wait, an awareness that this is about resolving a specific, smaller issue.There have been other changes in the structure of the sporting directorate. Robert Fernández has departed. Before him, there was Andoni Zubizarreta. Raul Sanllehi left just before Soler. The sporting manager is Pep Segura, Eric Abidal is the technical secretary, and Ramon Planes his assistant. Planes is considered the most capable, but does not carry great authority. There’s the president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his direct advisors too. Ernesto Valverde is the coach, not the manager, and his own future is far from secure. Ariedo Braida is reported to have been the key man in bringing in Boateng. He has long felt unheard at Barcelona, lost amidst may voices.Robert Fernández signed Artur, one of the few players seen as a “Barcelona” style player, and at a time when fewer footballers are making it from the youth system. The signing of Paulinho surprised and didn’t exactly delight purists, seemingly a total rupture with the club’s identity, but he was successful – and then immediately returned to China. Arturo Vidal surprised too, although his signing was justified as being a player in the Paulinho mould. He is not really, just as Coutinho has not proven to be quite the “Iniesta” he was proclaimed to be.After a difficult start, Dembélé is impressing greatly. Malcom was taken off Roma at the last minute, Barcelona leaping in on Monchi’s deal. The manager, though, did not really want him and a departure in this window is a possibility. And other pursuits are ongoing, from Adrien Rabiot to Frenkie De Jong. But it would be fair to suggest that some fans are lacking faith that they will be completed. Rodri, perhaps the most natural replacement for Sergio Busquets, joined Atlético. And Griezmann of course stayed there, when Barcelona were convinced they were getting him.The Frenchman was a market opportunity: he might not have been a natural fit in the Barcelona first XI, but he was a player of the very highest level available for just €100m (£88.1m). Barcelona chased and thought they had closed a deal. They brief that it was done. But Griezmann announced that he was not going to Barcelona after all on a TV documentary, produced by the Barcelona defender Gerard Piqué. The president didn’t know and Barcelona didn’t have their striker. They do now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56ce8546f90af71e1901eaa4b583c2dd85625a49/572_238_4397_2638/master/4397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9341958d20965bcfc816ee3a0dd0e630","title":"benjamin mendy manchester city burton albion carabao cup","story":"• Defender has not featured since November injury• ‘This is an unusual situation to be in when it is a semi-final’Pep Guardiola has confirmed Benjamin Mendy has the opportunity to begin his comeback from his latest injury in Manchester City’s Carabao Cup second leg semi-final at Burton.The Premier League club are 9-0 up from the first leg and appear to be as good as in next month’s final already, but Guardiola intends to use the fixture to give match time to Mendy, Kevin De Bruyne and a handful of youth players.“Some players need rhythm and are going to play. The guys who’ve had a lot of games will rest,” the Manchester City manager said “Some players coming back or back from injuries long-term are going to play. Kevin will play because he needs minutes on the pitch, Benjamin might be used from the bench. We can take the opportunity to introduce some young players, but not too many.“Two or three can play and two or three will be on the bench. I don’t want anyone thinking about the result in the first game, I want us to attack just as fluently and try to create more chances. This is an unusual situation to be in when it is a semi-final, but I would still like us to try and improve in every game.”Mendy has hardly played for City since his £52m transfer from Monaco two years ago (20 games in total). A cruciate injury sidelined him for most of the first season and he has not played this season since incurring cartilage damage to his other knee in November. City have not exactly struggled without him, winning the league at a canter last season and still engaged in four different competitions this time, though Guardiola believes he might have added a different dimension.“The results suggest we have not missed him too much but I miss him a lot,” Guardiola said. “I have a feeling he can give us something extra, and hopefully in the last part of the season we will be able to use him more. He can be unstoppable when he pushes from outside, he crosses very well and he’s such a clever player. He will need time to adjust after playing so few games, but we can always use a player of his quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb658d64d4e2e054cd33208857cfb11754915a42/0_192_2080_1247/master/2080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8857c6bf39da3f9e97d968f4c824d67","title":"scottish premiership is there a title race","story":"Three points separate the leading four clubs but the managers of Kilmarnock and Aberdeen have dismissed claims their sides can challenge Celtic at the summitThe strange thing about optimism attached to an unusually tight Scottish top-flight season is that this sense has generally emanated from those not involved in it. As the Premiership resumes on Wednesday, three points separate the top four teams. St Johnstone, who are sixth, are only eight from the summit.Those north of the border seeking bragging rights finally have ammunition. Chelsea, the fourth-placed team in the Premier League, are 13 points behind leaders Liverpool. In the Bundesliga, RB Leipzig lie fourth but 14 points worse off than Borussia Dortmund. A Juventus stroll towards the Serie A title is such that they lead by nine. Paris St-Germain have already dismantled Ligue 1 their advantage is 13 points over Lille with two matches in hand.Competition, of course, doesn’t relate directly to quality but Scottish fans have borne the brunt of jokes relating to a one- or two-horse races for long enough that they may enjoy these times. With only a couple of near misses therein, no Scottish team outside of Celtic and Rangers have won the title since 1985.Indeed, from revenue of £101.6m for the financial year of 2018 Celtic had labour costs of £59.3m. Hibs’ comparative figures were £9.6m and £5.3m.“I don’t think there is a title race,” said the Aberdeen manager, Derek McInnes. “I’m not sure anyone can say that, even if we would all want that. After 21 games it shows there is a real credibility at the moment but it falls short of a real title race.“If we get to March and April and there’s still congestion at the top then you could say with certainty that there is a title race on then. It’s easy to have a good couple of months in this league.” In truth, the modern day problem has been that such runs haven’t been easy at all.Aberdeen have 39 points versus Celtic’s 42. McInnes may cite realism as the cause for his comments but they appear needlessly fatalistic if this club’s staff don’t believe in smashing the status quo, why should supporters?Steve Clarke, Kilmarnock’s manager, entered similar territory as Rangers prepare to visit Rugby Park on Wednesday. Clarke revealed that the reported £35,000 per week Rangers are contributing towards the Bournemouth wage of Jermain Defoe equals his squad budget for the same period. Kilmarnock amassed more Premiership points than any other club in 2018 but Clarke, following heavy defeat by Celtic last month, accused people of “talking out of their backsides” when predicting a title tilt. The Ayrshire team are a point from the top. In Clarke’s defence, his budget is a fraction of that enjoyed even by McInnes and Kilmarnock were regulars at the wrong end of the table before his arrival.An exhilarating start by Heart of Midlothian had seen them race clear at the top before the kind of injury woe that a saboteur couldn’t have more appropriately masterminded. That the Edinburgh team are a mere six points behind Celtic following a slump owes plenty to subsequent Hearts recovery and a ision where leading teams have, to a greater degree than recently, nicked points from each other. When Hearts were at the peak of their powers the manager, Craig Levein, broke with convention by stating it was not his place “to tell supporters they cannot dream”.That Rangers and Hearts are better than last season is beyond dispute. Kilmarnock’s finest performer of the 2017-18 season, Youssouf Mulumbu, now warms the bench at Celtic. Aberdeen’s key man over the same period, Kenny McLean, moved to Norwich. Hibs have lost star midfielders to Sunderland and Aston Villa. Rangers were so dysfunctional last season that it was almost a given they would improve under Steven Gerrard.If the Scottish season plays out on the basis of resource alone, Celtic will streak clear and Rangers will establish themselves as a second force. Victory – fully deserved – for Gerrard’s side in the Old Firm game of 29 December has fuelled already fever-pitch excitement around Ibrox that Celtic can be halted. Gerrard’s transfer activity illustrates that belief extends to the boardroom. Rangers will play four league games away in the next month, during which they will seek to eliminate the travel sickness which blighted the early months of Gerrard’s tenure.That Rangers and Celtic wobbled between August and new year can be explained in part by participation in the group phase of the Europa League. Nonetheless, Celtic’s January return to the loan market for short-term fixes highlights their inability to place anything like the daylight between themselves and the rest as was possible when Rangers and other leading clubs weren’t competitive. Speculation linking Brendan Rodgers with Leicester City refuses to go away, amid the understanding that the former Liverpool manager inevitably has ambitions beyond Scotland.Should Rodgers decide this summer represents an opportune time to exit, orce would arrive at a time when Celtic have become more accustomed to domestic frights. Whether they exist because of a general improvement in standards, or regression from the top, is a fascinating point for debate. For now, Scots should cherish the unknown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46f05865b71a8c5b84d69e76665b6c22daf89b43/0_228_3418_2050/master/3418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d6118a51ff95f490643a3636c9e7f4e","title":"hopefuls pay out thousands rupees chase gurkha glory nepal","story":"Training academies – and unscrupulous agents – are cashing in on young men preparing for this month’s feared ‘doko race’ to secure a lucrative British army jobLong before the sun rises above the towering Himalayan peaks that overlook Pokhara in central Nepal, scores of young men gather in the dark on the edge of the town to train for the race of a lifetime.At the starter’s signal, they charge off, first heaving a 25kg sack of sand into a “doko” wicker basket on their backs, and then starting a gruelling 5km race up the steep mountainside. Finish in less than 46 minutes and they have a chance to join the Gurkhas, the legendary brigade of the British army.The Gurkhas’ reputation as a fighting force is almost mythical: brave young men from the hills of Nepal who fight by the motto, “Better to die than to be a coward”.This month hundreds of Nepalese young men aged 18-21 are battling it out at the British Gurkha Camp in Pokhara for just 400 coveted places, in a series of demanding physical and mental tests, which include the feared “doko race”.To make it this far, they have already seen off more than 6,000 young hopefuls who signed up for the regional selection phase in late summer 2018.The prize is not just a job in the British army, but a lucrative salary and pension, and the right to settle in the UK. For young men from one of the poorest countries in Asia, it is like winning the lottery.The British army insists the recruitment process is, “free, fair and transparent”, but with so much riding on selection, Gurkha recruitment has become big business for private training academies across Nepal.It has also become the target of bribery and extortion from unscrupulous dalals, or agents. They approach families of some potential recruits claiming to be able to use contacts at the British camp to secure them a place with the Gurkhas in exchange for a payment of tens of thousands of pounds.Their pitch is a lie – they have no links to the British army and no way to influence decisions in the British camp – but with so much at stake, it is one that desperate parents are susceptible to, especially in a country where corruption is widespread.“There is a real craze for the British army … so it’s common – you can ask anyone applying,” says Om Thapa, who runs a training academy for potential recruits.Ashok Thapa, 19, one of this year’s candidates, says his mother was approached by the son of a retired Gurkha demanding 2 million rupees (£13,500) to secure a place for him in the brigade.Years ago, the British army used to send ex-Gurkhas out into the hills to find potential recruits. Poverty was no bar to selection. Today, recruits are more likely to come from middle or upper-class urban families. The vast majority of the finalists have been to private school and speak fluent English.“The selection process now is completely different. Most of the candidates have achieved top grades. They are more professional and educated now, but in the past they were stronger,” says Rajesh Rai, an owner of Gurkha Fitness training academy.While potential recruits do not have to pay anything to the British army, they are shelling out thousands of pounds to join training academies, which promise to prepare them for recruitment.The number of academies nationwide has increased fivefold in the past 10 years to more than a hundred. Many candidates sign up months before the British army’s first phase of recruitment, and if they make the cut, they stay on at the academies until final selection, meaning the schools are guaranteed a year-round income with no shortage of repeat clients.The standard admission fee is 35,000 rupees for each phase of recruitment, but a candidate who spends a whole year at an academy can easily pay £1,800 in admission and hostel fees. Nepal’s per capita income is less than £800 a year.Rabi Sharma, 20, says he and all his friends have had to borrow money to pay the fees. “I didn’t join an academy in the past because I couldn’t afford it, but this is my last chance so I want to be prepared,” says Sharma, who will be too old to apply next year.Himal Limbu, vice-secretary of the Kathmandu branch of the Nepal Physical Training Association, the body that represents most of the training academies, says: “It’s up to a candidate to decide whether to prepare independently or go to the training centre. That’s a matter of inidual choice. We have been charging a nominal fee. For most of the training centres, the fee is hardly enough to pay for renting space and staff.”The British Gurkhas say they have no connection to any training academies and do not engage with them. “We actively advertise that it is not necessary to attend a training academy in order to successfully pass recruitment selection,” said a spokesperson for the British Gurkhas.The Gurkhas say they discourage people from spending money to get selected. “All the information on our selection assessments … are available on the army website. However, we cannot force people not to go to training academies and ultimately it is their choice,” said the spokesperson.Noah Coburn, a political anthropologist who has researched Gurkha recruitment, believes the British army should take more responsibility. “Numerous young men drop out of school or leave career paths to train for the British army. Once they fail, few actually rejoin school. Many are in pretty serious debt too … the British army ignores these repercussions,” says Coburn.Gurkha Fitness is one of a new crop of academies run by ex-British army soldiers. Co-owner Rajesh Rai says the academy attracted 700 candidates during the first phase of selection, guaranteeing a bumper pay day for his company.Its compound resembles an army camp, with dormitories packed with bunk beds, a canteen and a gym. Eye test charts are pinned to the walls alongside stacks of doko baskets.Kumar Newar, 19, has been at living at the academy for two years. Last time round he failed final selection because of a perforated ear drum. “I felt so bad, I cried … my family has spent a lot of money, about 300,000 rupees (£2,090) in two years.”After an operation to repair his ear, and another year of relentless training, Newar is confident he will win selection this time. “I want to join the Gurkhas for the fame and fortune,” he says.Becoming a Gurkha brings prestige and status, but for most the real motivation is the money.Each morning and evening at Pokhara’s sports ground, groups of potential recruits jog around the rough cinder track or pump out sit-ups to their favourite songs, blaring from their phones.“I want to continue the glorious legacy of the Gurkhas,” says Rabi Sharma, between laps of the track, repeating the standard response his academy has drilled into him, before adding, “and get a good salary and pension, and move to the UK. The salary and pension are the most important.”For potential recruits like Prakash Rana, 20, the cost is a risk worth taking. “If 35,000 rupees can bring 3.5m rupees in the future, then why not?”Some names have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9772274127cc75fed9c823d5dd55c84001daa3a9/977_0_2379_1428/master/2379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82c5eef8156a38f51a6b276617b0fe09","title":"record private jet flights davos leaders climate talk","story":"Experts predict up to 1,500 inidual private flights in and out of airfields serving Swiss ski resort for World Economic ForumDavid Attenborough might have urged world leaders at Davos to take urgent action on climate change, but it appears no one was listening. As he spoke, experts predicted up to 1,500 inidual private jets will fly to and from airfields serving the Swiss ski resort this week.“There appears to be a trend towards larger aircraft, with expensive heavy jets the aircraft of choice, with Gulfstream GVs and Global Expresses both being used more than 100 times each last year,” said Andy Christie, private jets director at the ACS.This is partly due to the long distances travelled, he said, “but also possibly due to business rivals not wanting to be seen to be outdone by one another”. Last year, more than 1,300 aircraft flights were recorded at the conference, the highest number since ACS began recording private jet activity in 2013.Countries with the highest number of arrivals and departures out of the local airports over the past five years included Germany, France, UK, US, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, according to ACS.The World Economic Forum’s global risk report, released ahead of this week’s meeting, identified environmental challenges, including the failure to mitigate climate change, as top of the list of dangers facing the world economy.On Monday, broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough warned that “the Garden of Eden is no more”, and urged political and business leaders to make a renewed push to tackle climate change.“We have changed the world so much that scientists claim we are in a new geological age, the anthropocene, the age of humans,” he said.“What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,” added Attenborough, who received a Crystal award from the WEF for his work.Speaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. “Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d01877cca51f8e72f09930a76b15f6cc9bca9d93/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003521899ae23ea16844b5f0a6ca2f17","title":"colleague nerdy know all rewrites my work what should i do","story":"Have you got a work-related problem?

Until she tried to get it made ...‘I didn’t think 2019 would start with me in my house in a onesie, hungover and watching Sister Act, angry,” says London Hughes, a 29-year old comedian and TV presenter from Brighton. But this anger did inspire a tweet that went viral: “Sister Act is on, and I’m still a tiny bit pissed off that in 2018 a whole Whoopi Goldberg agreed to do a travel show with me but no TV channels wanted it,” she posted on New Year’s Day.The comedian-travel show format is now well trodden, commonly involving a comic taking a trip with either their family (Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father, Romesh Ranganathan’s Asian Provocateur, Russell Howard \u0026amp Mum) or friends (Joel \u0026amp Nish vs the World, Dara Ó Briain’s Three Men in a Boat). Notice anything about these comics? All of them are men. In fact Sue Perkins seems to be the only woman in British comedy with a passport.Last year, Hughes was in discussion with a television production company to make a travel show – a far cry from a decade earlier when she wrote her first comedy set after being fired from TGI Fridays. Since then she has won the prestigious Funny Women comedy award, created a YouTube series, appeared on ITV2’s Don’t Hate the Playaz and Channel 4’s Celebs Go Dating, and has worked as a presenter on channels such as CBBC.Hughes idly mentioned to the production company that working with her comic hero, Whoopi Goldberg, would be great. “She’s my Beyoncé. She’s the only black female household name in comedy.” A month later Goldberg agreed to take part. “We could have done anything,” says Hughes. “We could have gone to Ibiza or sat in a caravan making sausages. It’s me and Whoopi Goldberg, who wouldn’t want to watch that?”So, what happened? “We took this idea to every channel,” says Hughes. “The feedback from some was that Whoopi Goldberg isn’t relevant enough. Not relevant? She’s a legend!”In response to Hughes’s tweet, comedians including Jenny Eclair, Gina Yashere and Katy Brand shared their frustration at having tried and failed to get similar shows commissioned. As the standup Tiff Stevenson put it, who was trying to put a show together with Meera Syal: “Travel is very different for women, let alone the fact we’ve all come up with differentcool ways of packaging it.”Jody Smith was formerly a commissioning editor at Channel 4 and is now creative director of Studio71, a TV production and talent management company. “The issue is there are fewer high-profile female comedians that broadcasters think will draw an audience to a show,” he says. “The only way to solve this is for channels to back more female comedians early on.”But Hughes believes that commissioners are too heavily influenced by the lack of ersity in the industry to understand why a female travel show might appeal. “The people making the comedy went to university with the people starring in the comedy,” she says. “If you didn’t have any black friends you’d think all we did was kill each other or make grime records,” she adds, laughing. “And I don’t tick that urban box. I’m from a lower- to middle-class family. I just happen to be a British black girl.“I don’t want to sound ungrateful,” she says. “I’ve had a great career and I’m actually making loads of other shows with the very channels that rejected the show with me and Whoopi. It’s not an attack, but a comment on the state of comedy right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35742f870566bb320d7cd178606b435b86761ad/0_851_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2a85149d492bce6424df039d393eb4c","title":"rio ferdinand drink 10 pints vodka interview","story":"Since retiring, the former England footballer has campaigned against Brexit and knife crime, and made a moving documentary about the death of his wife. Now he has embarked on a health business – but is it credible?Rio Ferdinand has experienced terrible loss in recent years. In 2015, his wife and the mother of his three children, Rebecca Ellison, died of cancer aged 34. Then in 2017 his mother, Janice St Fort, died from cancer too, aged 58. Now, he says, he is doing anything he can to ensure he and his children are not prematurely bereaved again.So perhaps it is not surprising to find the former footballer promoting a DNA kit that claims to pinpoint the personalised exercise and nutrition needed for a longer life. Ferdinand is 40 now, and looks even stronger than he did when he was one of the best defenders in the world, an imposing, beautifully balanced ball-playing centre back who won 81 England caps and six Premier League titles with Manchester United. He is certainly bigger – 16kg (2st 7lb) heavier, a brick wall of a man, with arms like surfboards.He may have been a supremely fit athlete, but now he says that throughout his playing career he was so skinny, he often felt weak. “You could see the fibres in my body when I was walking about when I played ’cos I was so lean.” The first thing he wanted to do after he quit football was bulk up – not least because he fancied becoming a professional boxer. He was refused a licence last year and gave up on that ambition.There isn’t much that Ferdinand has not tried his hand at since he retired. He made a desperately moving documentary about life after the death of Rebecca, Being Mum and Dad wrote an equally moving book about it with the journalist Decca Aitkenhead started a clothing line became a football pundit campaigned against leaving the EU and knife crime visited schools and prisons.As well as the campaigning side, Ferdinand has always had a touch of the Del Boy about him. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between Rio the crusader and Rio the wheeler-dealer. And today is such an occasion. He is flanked by a member of his sports management team and a publicist representing DNAFit, a nutrigenetics company that has created a simple saliva swab test it claims will transform lives. Nutrigenetics is an emerging – and as yet largely unproven – science that studies the interaction between genes and nutrition, with the hope of preventing disease.We are in a small, claustrophobic office near London Bridge. Ferdinand seems to fill the room by himself. He is long and languid, tanned, with an immaculately strimmed beard. Suddenly, the room is even more crowded, as we are joined by a verbose businessman who speaks faster than anybody I’ve ever met.“This is Avi,” says the publicist. “He’s here to explain all the technical stuff.” It suddenly feels as if I’ve been interview-bombed I have a funny feeling that Avi is going to try to make this all about him.Avrom Lasarow is a 43-year-old entrepreneur. His fulsome Wikipedia entry states that he left South Africa for the UK “where he began his career which ultimately led to a string of multinational companies”. Last April, DNAFit was bought by a Hong Kong-based genetics company, Prenetics, for $10m (£7.8m), and it appointed Lasarow CEO of Prenetics International. But enough of Avi. For now.Ferdinand tells me of the enormous benefits he has reaped since being DNA tested. When he was trying to bulk up, he soon reached a ceiling, he says, and it was only after getting the DNAFit results that he realised he was doing everything wrong. “I wanted to gain weight, gain muscle mass and retain it. But I quickly hit a ceiling. I was knocking my head thinking: what’s going on?”So what did he discover? “I was eating huge carbs and not enough protein and now my diet is much more balanced. Now I’m 101kg (15st 13lb), but comfortable. When I was playing I was 85kg (13st 5lb).” He also started to do more power than endurance work in the gym. I’m no expert, but surely you don’t need a DNA test to tell you a protein boost and lifting weights is an effective means of muscling up?Many scientists believe we simply don’t know enough about nutrigenetics for companies such as DNAFit to deliver on its promises. Prof Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and a world leader in personalised nutrition, says: “Although this is an area of research that has potential, it is unclear whether the science is already there and thus far there is no evidence that it works.” But Ferdinand is convinced if he’d had this information when he was playing, he would have had an even more distinguished career. “Trust me, I would have been able to play longer, I would have got 100 caps.”How else has the DNA test helped him?“ Alcohol,” he says. “If you’re doing it in moderation … ” He looks at Lasarow. “What is it, a drink a day?”“A glass of wine a day is good for you,” Lasarow says. “For instance, in Rio’s case he has a certain genome type, so alcohol in moderation increases good cholesterol.”Ferdinand says that while he and his fiance, the former Towie star Kate Wright, like to set a good example to his kids by eating healthily, he has in no way become a food fascist. “I go to a kebab shop on a Friday and I like a pint of Guinness, a whisky or whatever.”How much Guinness can he get through on a good night? He grins. “I used to get through a load when I was younger.” How many pints? “I could probably do eight, nine, 10.” He pauses. “Then I’d move on to the vodkas.” He giggles. “I could go through loads. I could go all day drinking, then wake up and go again when I was younger.”Blimey, you were drinking all that as a professional footballer? He nods. “I always say to people who ask if I have any regrets about playing, I wouldn’t have drunk alcohol.” Did he drink more than most footballers? “No.” He quickly changes his mind. “When I was younger I did. I was a lunatic. When I was at West Ham … elements of my career are a blur. People talk about performances and results at certain times in them games and I just sit and nod my head. I haven’t got a clue what they’re talking about. I don’t remember.”Would he drink on a Friday night? “No, that would be after a game. Saturday or Sunday. It was a different culture. Crazy. The culture I was in at West Ham was a drinking culture. Football and drinks and nightclubs, that’s the way it was. And that’s the way I lived at that time.”When he went to Manchester United, he says, he pretty much stopped drinking during the season. But he would make up for it in the off season. “In the summers I’d drink for two weeks. Bang. Just keep drinking.”He could so easily have destroyed his health and career. Does he look back and think he was lucky? “Yes. I was lucky. I had a natural ability that could get me through that period of my life. But I got to a point where I had to make a decision to be more professional.”Ferdinand’s boozing confessions are certainly a good example of a life lived less healthily, but Lasarow is keen to get back to DNAFit.“Have you ever done preventive testing?” he asks me. I tell him I’m not proud of this, but I’m more of the less-you-know-the-better school. Ferdinand says he used to be the same. What changed him? Simple, he says – the loss of his wife and mother to cancer. “I’ve got a young family who have seen more than enough trauma for anyone’s lifetime, and I want to be best placed to help prevent anything like that happening if I can. I want all the information I can get from the DNA kit for myself so hopefully my kids won’t have to see any more trauma earlier than they should.”DNAFit and Ferdinand began their campaign in Peckham, a deprived district of south-east London where the former footballer grew up on a council estate. “We went into a couple of schools, and all the children said: I’d love my parents to do this.” (You have to be 18 or over to do the test.) I ask Ferdinand if it is affordable, but Lasarow answers on his behalf. “How much do you spend a month at the gym? You might go to the gym and pay your fees for six months but not get the right results because you’re not doing the right things. Of course, there’s a price because it’s a science there’s a commercial aspect. There’s a small price to pay.” How much? “£99.”Ferdinand went to Blackheath Bluecoat, the secondary school attended by Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racist attack at the age of 18. Did he know Lawrence? Yes, he says. He was four years younger than Lawrence, but because he was a big, confident boy he played football with him and his best friend Duwayne Brooks, who was also attacked on that night in Eltham. “It’s mad what happened. When it happened it was like your life just comes to a standstill. I’d always seen knives or people get shot or whatever, but a young boy at school getting stabbed to death … it’s like, fucking hell. When the news came the first question I had was: where was it, where was it? Then we heard it was in Eltham. The first thing all of us were saying was: what the fuck is he doing there, in that area, at that time – it’s a racist area, don’t go there at that time.”When given the chance, Ferdinand talks touchingly and honestly about his past. But even in these moments, Lasarow is keen to intervene. “Simon, sorry to deflect away from that,” he says. “You were saying you’d promise your partner you’d go for a checkup – if you don’t and, God forbid, you fell ill, the burden on her is increased because the associated costs of being ill would have to be taken take care of … ” I’m not sure how to respond, so I don’t.Did Lawrence’s murder give Ferdinand a sense of how precarious life could be? “It made me aware that if you get into a problem it could be a big problem. But I was aware of that already. I was used to seeing violence.”Maybe it was inevitable that Ferdinand would go on to campaign about knife crime, and was vocal about racism in football. (After John Terry allegedly racially abused his football player brother, Anton Ferdinand, on the pitch, Rio stopped talking to Terry, even though they were defensive partners in the England team. Terry was banned for four matches and fined by the FA.) But he says his values, his willingness to speak out, came more from his parents than his experiences. “My mum and dad are really community-driven people.” He still sometimes talks about his mother in the present tense. “That’s probably the reason me and Kate are the way we are with the kids because my mum and dad were doers. They didn’t have to tell me a lot about being part of the fabric of the community and being vocal about things. They did it, and I’ve seen it, and that’s why I am the way I am.”Lasarow jumps in. “The great thing about genetics,” he says, “and what we’re doing is it can impact anybody or anyone, anywhere, Brexit or no Brexit.” I look at him, gobsmacked.“Wow, Avi,” I say, “that is the most random intervention I’ve ever heard.”Even Ferdinand’s agents can’t help laughing at his attempt to steer the conversation back to DNA. Look, I say, we’ve talked loads about DNA, but an interview with Rio also involves talking to Rio about Rio.I ask Ferdinand if he would fancy going into politics. “No.” Why not? “It’s a murky world. I’ve got no faith or trust in politicians so to be one – I’d find it difficult.” Has there ever been a politician he has trusted? “I like Gordon Brown. I’ve met him a few times. There was a sincerity about him I really liked.”“Simon, we’ve got a couple of minutes left,” says his publicist.Ferdinand was part of an England squad known as the golden generation – supremely gifted iniduals who underachieved as a team. How did he feel when he saw a more prosaic England team reach the semi-final of the World Cup last year? “There’s no sour grapes, if that’s what you’re alluding to.” No, I say, I’m just interested that they achieved more with less ability. “It doesn’t matter how good you are. You look at our team, we had probably the best bunch of midfielders in the world at the time – Scholes, Gerrard, Lampard, Beckham, Hargreaves, Carrick etc – but we didn’t have a manager who could find the formation that could fit them in and get the best out of each and every one of them. We played a very rigid 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1, and that was the most intricate it got after Glenn Hoddle. Then we got beat by teams with not as good players, specially in tournaments. So you’ve got to be coached right, and the players have got to believe in what they’re being coached, which this group of players do.”“We helped the Egyptian team to get to the World Cup for the first time in 28 years,” Lasarow says proudly. “I’m not saying genetics is everything, it certainly isn’t … ” Egypt lost all three games they played at the 2018 World Cup.In the past, Ferdinand has said that as a player he prided himself on his iciness. Does he think he has changed since retiring? “I’m still quite an intense person but I’m a lot more open. I had the blinkers on. I didn’t see a lot of things emotionally to do with relationships, with friends or family.” I tell him how refreshing it was to see him weeping openly about Rebecca in the documentary and talking about panic attacks – a good example to all the boys and men who suppress their feelings. “Yes, that’s a big thing that came out of it. Everyone’s had a mental health problem in some shape or form, it’s just identifying it and then hitting it head on and meeting it, but again, it’s a cultural shift.”I ask Ferdinand what he thinks of himself as now, primarily – a football pundit, entrepreneur or campaigner? “I’ve never been anyone who’s wanted to be pigeon-holed. So, for instance, when I did ballet, all my mates from the estate took the piss. But I wasn’t fazed by stuff like that. I’ve been comfortable in my own skin since I was young so I never really cared about what anyone had to say. That’s why, as a footballer, I was comfortable creating a digital magazine, getting a restaurant, going into different fields.”You were also one of the few footballers prepared to say what you think. “Well, you’re taught not to, that’s the problem.”Was he pleased that the England international Raheem Sterling recently talked about the racism he has experienced. “Yes, it’s been hard work for him but he’s hitting the right notes, not only on the pitch … ”But Lasarow has had enough of the football talk. “My mission today is to make sure you leave with a DNA test,” he tells me. He turns to Ferdinand. “I think you want to wrap up now, don’t you?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b34dc34165c231284abeacec142013efbc38b2c/0_3382_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9011cede453f0ce4b2605372740e63b4","title":"young or old tell us about the major life events that shaped you","story":"We would like to hear from you as part of a project introducing readers of different generations to one anotherAs part of a new project that aims to explore major life events from different perspectives and across generational ides, the ’s Weekend magazine is looking to hear from readers.If one of the following questions apply to you, we’d like to hear from you.

Its founders explain how they’re standing up to authoritarianismLurking below the hulking concrete cantilevers of Tbilisi’s Dinamo Arena, an Olympic-sized doughnut near the banks of the Mtkvari river, is one of the greatest nightclubs in the world. Find your way through a pitch-black maze of underground stairs and corridors, and you’ll arrive at a 21st-century techno mecca, and a potent symbol of political rupture in post-Soviet Georgia.After starting out as a warehouse party, Bassiani – meaning “one with the bass” – moved into the stadium in 2014 thanks to a chance acquaintance with the director of the national football team. Sharing certain similarities with Berlin techno destination Berghain, the club has two rooms with distinct personalities: there’s Bassiani itself, the vast concrete cavern with its striking spotlights and incredible, pin-sharp sound. Then upstairs is Horoom (the name comes from a traditional dance), a more intimate space and one that is defiantly queer in a country where Orthodox Christian values prevail.In addition to its unique setting and permissive atmosphere, Bassiani has nurtured a cadre of resident DJs – including HVL, Kancheli and NDRX – who have since broken into the European scene. A certain kind of neck-deep, full-pelt techno is prevalent, but there’s no house style on any given night you might hear dirty ghetto house, 80s goth and roughneck breaks. Recent international bookings include Clone Records boss Serge, rising techno talent Anastasia Kristensen and scruffy house herbert Mall Grab. Diversity is a guiding principle, from the music to the iniduals in the crowd. To weed out troublemakers, ticket buyers must submit their Facebook profile for vetting. “I don’t really like the concept of ‘face control’ – it really categorises people – but the reason we’re doing it is the safety of the audience,” explains Gelbakhiani. “We really support LGBTQ people and there are many of them dancing in the club, so we don’t want to see somebody being aggressive. Safety comes first.”Away from the dancefloor, there’s plenty more to explore: the warren of dark rooms that offer a rare space for sexual encounters in a country where many young people live with their parents, and a smoking area where tired clubbers can take a nap or, since last year, smoke a spliff. The decriminalisation of cannabis has been a confusing development in the standoff between Georgia’s young, progressive generation and their conservative elders. In May last year, armed police raided Bassiani and made eight drug-related arrests in response, thousands of clubbers protested outside parliament, sparking a dramatic weekend of counter-demonstrations and riot police intervention.HVL – Elegance Within the ChaosZviad Gelbakhiani: “The very first Bassiani label release from one of the most prominent artists in today’s scene. This track has been played many times as a closing track during the morning – emotional, lucid sound from the club’s very own resident HVL.”“On an ordinary day in our very small office – which used to be in the club – our label A\u0026ampR sent this track for checking out. There was a silence after listening to it. I still remember the moment, and how determined we were to check it out on club’s PA. All of us went straight to the main floor, sat down and listened it to many, many times.”“There’s much to say about Northern Electronics’ Varg and his connection to Bassiani. Once we headed up to Georgia’s beautiful mountain, Kazbegi, after the party – but the road was closed and we were stuck. This track had been recorded at this very strange hotel we stayed at for one night. You can feel the momentum while to listening it. There was absolute emptiness outside of the window, with a mixture of obscure silence and soulless snow.”“This is one of my favourite releases on the Bassiani label that’s not by a resident DJ. The melody and drums make it one of our greatest releases from 2018, and it’s been played many times outside of Tbilisi in different clubs.”“Héctor Oaks’ As We Were Saying was inspired by the raids on the club. There were tough times last May, but this release is kind of a symbol of unity, solidarity and of our victory over the repressive, insulting political classes. Héctor is known for his long sets in Horoom and Bassiani, and this track could be the soundtrack of those marathon closing sets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8ff2c3bd185d6d1ae8ba452b9cfb1ce9ffdcd9/0_73_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5df30665265b5be374de81712409fe6f","title":"mps on parental leave to be allowed proxy vote","story":"Announcement follows outcry after MP delayed birth of her son to vote on Brexit dealProxy voting will be introduced to the House of Commons on a one-year pilot, Andrea Leadsom has announced.It follows an outcry over the lack of support for the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who delayed the birth of her son by two days to vote against Theresa May’s EU withdrawal agreement.Despite initial indications that somebody would be allowed to vote in Siddiq’s place a week ago, the MP was subsequently told by the Conservatives she would have to go to Westminster in person if she wanted her voted to be recorded.Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs that a motion approving the scheme would be on the order paper for approval by the house on Monday 28 January.She said: “I am delighted to be able to confirm to the house today that a substantive motion on proxy leave in the case of maternity, paternity and adoption has been tabled today for the house’s agreement on Monday 28 January.“This is a step forward, removing the choice between parliamentary and parental responsibilities, and helping to make parliament a more modern workplace,” she said.Siddiq, who was advised by doctors to have a caesarean section after complications in the birth of her first daughter, Azalea, voted in a wheelchair last week against May’s agreement.Siddiq blamed the Conservatives, saying: “It is sad to learn that senior politicians are actively delaying proxy voting in order to gain a partisan advantage.”She was pushed through the ision lobbies in a wheelchair by Labour colleague Clive Lewis. The government lost by a record 230 votes.Her son, Raphael Mujib St John Percy, was born on Thursday, two days after the vote.Responding to the announcement, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn tweeted a photo of herself holding her son while watching Leadsom at the dispatch box.Leadsom made the announcement in a response to an urgent question tabled by Jo Swinson, who was excluded in a similar pairing row last summer. Swinson welcomed the announcement but said the situation Siddiq was put in last week was “shameful”. The one-year pilot will be based on the procedure committee report into proxy voting.The scheme will be available in cases of childbirth or care of an infant or newly-adopted child and will be administered by the Speaker, with the proxy vote cast by another member or a whip.The change takes the form of a temporary standing order.The pilot allows for the procedure committee to review the success of the scheme before the end of the pilot, after which it is hoped it can be rolled out on a permanent basis.The full practical details of how the scheme will operate will be discussed by the house authorities and will be signed off by the Speaker as well as the leaders of the three largest political parties in the house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed9c26e2dc786b957de7472c66e16d4742d25518/478_353_3935_2361/master/3935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcd2a49fbaa975ec7af53d768c85f966","title":"no deal brexit would mean hard irish border eu confirms","story":"Spokesman says it is ‘pretty obvious’ border controls would be needed under no dealFollow the latest political developments - live updatesThe EU has confirmed it will enforce a hard border on the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, despite the risk it would pose to peace.In comments that will be highly uncomfortable for Dublin, Jean-Claude Juncker’s chief spokesman told reporters it was “pretty obvious” that border infrastructure would be necessary if the UK were to leave without a deal.Both the Irish and British governments have been wary about speculating on the repercussions of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, was caught on tape last week indicating that his fellow ministers should not talk about the resumption of checks publicly for fear of a backlash.In a private conversation, he had told the Irish transport minister, Shane Ross, that “once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland”.But the EU’s chief spokesman said on Tuesday that the likely enforcement of border checks could not be avoided.He said: “If you were to push me to speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario in Ireland, I think it is pretty obvious you will have a hard border, and our commitments to the Good Friday agreement and everything we have been doing for years with our tools, instruments and programmes will have to take inevitably into account this fact. So of course we are for peace. Of course we stand behind the Good Friday agreement but that is what a no-deal scenario would entail.”The European commission spokesman also echoed the complaints of many in the House of Commons about Theresa May’s statement on Monday by claiming that “at this stage we have nothing new to say from Brussels because there is nothing new from London”.“We continue to follow very closely the ongoing parliamentary debate in the UK. We urge the UK to clarify its intentions as soon as possible,” the spokesman said.During her appearance in the Commons, May insisted that she had listened to the MPs who had voted down her deal but was subsequently accused of failing to offer any new ideas to win round parliament. May’s deal was rejected last week by 230 votes, the heaviest defeat ever for a sitting government.Juncker’s spokesman said Brussels welcomed May’s announcement, in her statement, that the UK would waive the £65 fee for those seeking settled status in the country as the “only new element” in her update to parliament.However, he added: “This … doesn’t provide the sort of clarity of intentions that we are expecting as soon as possible on the broader picture of the orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.”Of May’s plans to return to seek further concessions on the Irish backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border, the spokesman said the deal agreed was “not open to negotiation”.The Democratic Unionist party’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson MP, tweeted in response: “More belligerent bluffing from the EU in a desperate attempt to up the ante. It didn’t work before and it won’t work now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4da3851af80756d5b2d86363d0029b5b0235f2be/0_275_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de73a13f51608a62dc386baee6438c31","title":"tell us have you applied for dual citizenship due to brexit","story":"We would like to find out more about readers who have started the process or are considering applying for new or dual nationalityAs part of our reporting on Brexit we would like to talk to British people who, in the light of the result of the referendum or status of negotiations since, have applied or are applying for citizenship of other EU countries in order to become dual nationals in order to keep their EU citizenship.These could be Britons living in the UK who have applied to specific EU countries on the grounds of birth, marriage, parents’ or grandparents’ heritage, or any other claimed citizenship qualification Britons living in the EU who are applying to their country of residence for citizenship of that country or people who are seeking an EU passport by any other means, perhaps by investing in another EU country.Share your story in the form below.

Because sometimes in order to lead, you have to get out of the way,” she wrote.“The political quagmire in which the UK finds itself cries out for new activists and new ideas.“With democracy so broken, it has never been more important to do politics differently. My urgent aim is to champion many new campaigners, activists and leaders with different backgrounds.”Pointing to the debate within feminist and political movements that they have not been inclusive enough, Walker said: “I am also frustrated by the limits of my own work to ensure that women of colour, working class women and disabled women see themselves reflected in this party and know they can lead this movement.”Walker was elected leader last March and has left before her five-year term official ended.She stood to become the London mayor in 2016. In the 2017 general election, she stood to become MP for Shipley, but lost to Conservative MP and men’s rights activist Philip Davies.A statement from the party’s co-founders, the television presenter Sandi Toksvig and Catherine Mayer, said: “We are hugely sorry to see Sophie go, but as we look back over her tenure as leader of the Women’s Equality party, we also thank our lucky stars that she was there from the beginning and stayed for as long as she did to see this new party fully launched and established.“We set up the party because we were impatient for equality and we wanted to open politics to the talents it routinely excludes. We knew these untapped talents were out there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

In 2016, the party achieved what its leaders had always dreamed of: a referendum victory for leaving the EU.

Ministers are outlining the risks of a no deal on health, the economy, transport and farming.The Labour first minister Mark Drakeford said: In a series of statements ministers will outline the risks we face – for public services, the economy and across society. The impacts are potentially far ranging and will be felt by everyone. These are not theoretical or hypothetical concerns but the reality of where we now find ourselves. Today’s series of statements is part of our determination to ensure that assembly members are kept updated on this work.The truth is that no one really knows what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It follows that neither Wales nor the UK as a whole can be truly prepared for all the possible eventualities.Vaughan Gething, cabinet secretary for health and social services, was first up. He said:I continue to be concerned about the future supply of radioisotopes to Wales in the event of a no deal scenario. Radioisotopes are essential for diagnostic and therapeutic use by our NHS. There are no sources in the UK and supplies are routinely imported from other EU countries through the main cross-channel ports. Disruption from customs checks at our ports is likely to render radioisotopes useless for healthcare treatment.A no deal Brexit will have a profound impact on all professions and all health and social care staff. The effects of changes to migration policy, particular a policy which favours high skills and wages, will be most keenly felt in those parts of the health and social care sector which depend on lower-paid workers, such as workers providing domiciliary or residential care, who have essential roles supporting some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Let us be clear, disruption in our social care sector would inevitably lead to delayed discharges and increased pressures on our hospitals.The Welsh government has been clear that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious and unavoidable harm to our health and care services. That harm would extend to all sectors, including at least 1,400 EU nationals known to working in our NHS.Here is the Labour MP Virendra Sharma on the news that the Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski is asking the Polish government to intervene in the Brexit process (see 3.40pm and 3.43pm), in a statement released by the anti-Brexit group, Best for Britain.It appears that Kawczynski has today appointed himself as roving Ambassador to Poland. I am sure Warsaw has been waiting for his letter with bated breath. I don’t envy Daniel’s burden of self-awareness. Taking back control by asking a foreign government to veto a request made by the sovereign British Parliament is an interesting move.And here is Euronews’ Darren McCaffrey on the same story.This is from Kevin Doyle, from the Independent in Ireland.Guy Verhofstadt has opened the door to Brexit negotiations extending into the next session of the next European parliament.The Liberal MEP, who is the European parliament’s pointman on Brexit, said it would be more difficult to prolong article 50 beyond the 2 July, the first day of the new European parliament. However, he did not rule out an extension beyond the summer, as he has done on previous occasions. “Certainly I think this is only possible in the case the UK can indicate for how long and what for,” he said, while adding that with no clear plan “to break the deadlock seems to me very difficult to do”.Commenting in detail on specific amendments in the House of Commons, Verhofstadt said MEPs needed to monitor closely developments at Westminster. But he ruled out any changes to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, saying:There are limits on what we can accept. For us the backstop is non-negotiable.The EU could consider changes to the non-binding political declaration that maps out the future, he said.We are open for a deeper and more closer relationship than the relationship that is in the political declaration.Verhofstadt was speaking to MEPs on the European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee, who are responsible for scrutinising the withdrawal agreement. The committee chair Danuta Hübner said that work would begin next week, despite uncertainty over whether Westminster will ratify the deal.If the UK remained a member state at the time of European elections in May, the UK had “the duty to organise European elections in line with the treaty and the electoral act,” said Hübner. “Any failure on this will mean a breach of the treaties and can be brought to the courts, of course.”But other MEPs objected to suggestions that the UK could gain an extension, an indication of the pressure facing EU leaders who would ultimately agree any extension of talks.Veteran French MEP Alain Lamassoure said the EU needed to put its foot down on extension. He said:Let me tell you this. If we accept this idea of extending the deadline without any serious political grounds for it and extend it beyond June 30, it will be the European Union that will pay the price, because we are never going to get out of that muddle.Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has dismissed Theresa May’s Brexit ‘plan B’ as just ‘plan A’ with “a new helping of pious hopes”, the Western Mail’s David Williamson reports.According to Jakub Krupa, the Polish government will reject the Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski’s call for it to veto any extension of article 50. (See 3.40pm.)The Brexiter Tory Daniel Kawczynski, who was born in Poland, says he has asked the Polish government to veto an extension of article 50. Poland could decide the matter because, for article 50 to be extended, the UK would have to make that request, and the EU27 would have to agree the move unanimously.Nick Gutteridge, the Sun’s Brussels reports, thinks Kawczynski’s idea is a non-starter.According to the Sun’s Steve Hawkes, the Conservative MP Phillip Lee is going to table an amendment calling for a second referendum. Lee is planning this with his fellow Tory Brexit-sceptic, Sarah Wollaston. They are both doctors, and they have described this as an “informed consent” amendment - based on the idea that Brexit is such an extreme measure that it should only go ahead with the “informed consent” of the electorate (ie, that people should vote on the Brexit deal on the table, not just the principle, as they did in 2016).The Hawkes tweet refers to reports that the People’s Vote campaign (PV) have been trying to get Lee to delay, on the grounds that they don’t want MPs to vote on a second referendum until the Labour party is committed to supporting the idea.Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on the DromeySpelman amendment. (See 2.45pm.)The Conservative MP Andrew Murrison has confirmed that he has retabled his amendment demanding an end date to the backstop.According to the Spectator (see 2.08pm), Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, told cabinet that this was exactly the sort of intervention the government needed. That is because, if MPs were to pass the Murrison amendment by a decent majority, Theresa May would be able to go back to Brussels citing this as proof that, with an expiry date added, her deal would be able to get through the Commons.But there is no guarantee that the Murrison amendment will be put to a vote. He tabled a similar amendment ahead of the big Brexit debate on Tuesday last week, but it was not called by the speaker, John Bercow.The Labour MP Jack Dromey and the Conservative MP Caroline Spelman have announced that they have tabled a joint amendment to the Brexit motion for Tuesday next week ruling out a no-deal Brexit.It is the shortest and simplest of all the amendments that have been tabled so far.That this House, in accordance with the provisions of section 13(6)(a) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, has considered the written statement titled “statement under section 13(4) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018” and made on 21 January 2019.And this is what the DromeySpelman amendment says:At end add “and rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship”.Already six amendments to the government motion are on the order paper (pdf). Now we are up to seven. We don’t know yet how many will be called on Tuesday, but some of them will get ignored, and the amendments with most chance of success will be those with wide support across the Commons.The advantage this one has is that it would be easy for Conservative MPs to support. It does not involve any of the procedural innovation that features in amendments like Dominic Grieve’s. (See 10.58am.) And Spelman, who does not have form as an anti-Brexit Tory rebel, is probably a less isive figure amongst her party colleagues than Grieve.But the disadvantage with the amendment is that it is relatively innocuous. It would not be binding and, if passed, it would not necessarily stop the government taking the UK out of the EU without a deal.Dromey and Spelman both represents West Midlands constituencies where thousands of their constituents either work at the local Jaguar Land Rover factories or for their suppliers. In a joint statement, Dromey and Spelman said:We must rule out the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. As 29th March fast approaches, it becomes increasingly clear that crashing out of the EU without a deal will cause chaos and put the jobs of thousands of our constituents at risk.We are confident that there is widespread agreement across all parties in the House that a no-deal Brexit should be avoided. This amendment seeks to send that clear message: no to no deal.Whilst we remain committed to honouring the result of the referendum, for the sake of the people we represent, we cannot sanction crashing out of the EU without a deal.The Spectator’s James Forsyth has written a good blog about what happened at today’s cabinet. The Brexit discussion was calmer than some people expected, he says. Here’s an extract.Perhaps, the two most interesting contributions came from Jeremy Hunt and David Gauke. Gauke questioned the government’s new approach. He said he was worried that even if the government did get something on the backstop, there still wouldn’t be enough Tory MPs backing the deal for it to pass. While Hunt argued that the best thing for the government to do was to get parliamentary support for a plan on time-limiting the backstop. Having done that, the Foreign Secretary argued, the UK should go back to the EU and say, this is what can pass parliament.On the basis of this account, Jeremy Hunt seems to be hoping for a new version of the Andrew Murrison amendment to be tabled for the debate next Tuesday. There is nothing like that on the order paper yet, but MPs have until Monday night to table amendments.Here is the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq tweeting about the proxy voting announcement that she helped to trigger.In the Commons Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is responding to an urgent question on proxy voting in the chamber for MPs on maternity leave. In recent days, prompted by the Tulip Siddiq case, John Bercow, the speaker, has repeatedly complained about the government’s failure to go ahead and introduce proxy voting, despite MPs backing the idea in principle around a year ago.Leadsom says she profoundly believes that new parents should be able to spend time with their new babies. She says she can now announce that MPs will vote to introduce a proxy voting scheme on Monday next week (28 January).The motion (which is almost certain to be passed, perhaps even without opposition), will implement a one-year proxy voting pilot, based on proposals in a procedure committee report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a469373b462d401a952d949852a07c28e8862756/0_282_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cd5cae133e2bfd248fed3258e5ae5b3","title":"flexible working how to stay focused whether at home or the coffee shop","story":"It’s easy to get distracted when you are not working in the office. Experts share their top tips to improve efficiency and productivityRachael Dines admits she never planned on working for herself, but after being made redundant while pregnant, she began working as a marketing consultant from home. “My husband bought me a laptop and I would literally sit on the sofa and try to run the business,” she says. “That didn’t lead to great productivity. Everything was overlapping with my home life, you’re easily distracted. There are just so many things that can interrupt your day.”Part of the reason for that, Graham Allcott, director at productivity training provider Think Productive, says, may be a misconception around flexible working that’s still evident in some businesses. “I think most companies are still very stuck in this idea that it’s five days a week, 9am-5pm in an office, and you need to be in,” Allcott says.Clare Evans, productivity coach and author of Time Management for Dummies, believes flexible working can really boost morale among the team if the trust is there. “When people work from home, they have much more control over their working hours. Whether they start earlier, finish later, work around family, and other priorities they might have.” For her, it’s important for home workers to have a dedicated space to work from, to have the right technology and to set parameters for the day – including working hours and daily objectives. “Avoid multitasking – focus on one thing at a time,” she says, adding that hanging out washing and other household chores can be left to an appropriate break. She’s also found the Pomodoro technique – breaking work intervals into 25 minutes, followed by a five-minute break, can help maintain focus. “It’s important to take breaks wherever you’re working. Finish one task before getting on with the next one.”Allcott recommends starting the day with some sort of a commute to optimise productivity, even if it’s just walking around the block to buy milk, or taking the dog out. “Get some fresh air and have a transition – you’re getting ready for work, you’re walking to work, now you’re at work,” he says. Most people are at their most attentive in the morning, so this is the best time to address difficult projects, rather than just answering emails that have come in overnight. “The trick is to ignore some of that latest and loudest stuff, and focus on the deeper, more important stuff,” he adds. He’s also found it helps being accountable to someone else, even if it’s just an email you promised to send at a certain time, or a task you had committed to finish on a particular day.After six years of freelancing, Dines launched the marketing and design agency Shake It Up Creative with co-director Meg Fenn in 2015. Though she’s had to make a conscious effort to stay focused while working remotely, she says it has definitely helped make her days more productive. She now leaves the couch for non-work related laptop time, in favour of setting up a proper work space in a separate room, always dresses for work (this might include jeans, but never jogging bottoms or pyjamas) and has become really strict with herself about scheduling her work day. “I definitely work harder now than I did when I was in an office,” she adds.SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

His presence was always such a reassuring one that it wouldn’t be a surprise, even now, to switch on TMS and hear his sensible tones expressing some surprise at an outrageous choice of shot or an outre hairstyle. Something of the world at least would be back in its rightful place.An unfashionably old-style Englishman, slightly out of place in the late 20th century, let alone the 21st, he nevertheless treated everyone, from hotel receptionist to taxi driver, with a hundred small courtesies (always, in The Spin’s book, a pretty good signal of someone’s humanity).Way back in the 1990s I was asked by my friend the late journalist Charlie de Lisle, who had co-written a book – An Australian Summer – with CMJ, to interview him for publicity purposes. I set off on one of those sweet summer days where a breath of the morning air is enough to have you cartwheeling barefoot down the garden path, to his beautiful house in deepest Sussex where I was given coffee by his wife Judy before being invited into CMJ’s book-lined study. Probably tongue-tied and definitely overawed, I jotted down everything I could see on the shelves whenever I thought CMJ wasn’t looking.The piece never saw the light of day, I can’t now remember what was on the shelves and the dictaphone tape was lost long ago, but I hold tightly to the memory of a kind, impeccably polite man who gave thoughtful answers to what would have been rambling questions as his friendly black labrador pottered to and fro.He was the same person on TMS and a good starting-point for Cook, who has raised a few eyebrows with his pre-microphone pronouncements.“I am not going to criticise James Anderson if he has a bad day,” he said in the Sunday Times. “Broady too. There is no way around it. We have been through so much together, especially Jimmy. I have too much respect for him and I am too friendly with him.”Perhaps Cook has been scarred by the experiences of his own former captain Andrew Strauss. Strauss had thought about giving commentary a go, before he accidentally called Kevin Pietersen “a complete cunt” when he thought he was off-air during a stint at Lord’s for Sky. He soon gave up any thoughts of a media career and went on to join the England and Wales Cricket Board.CMJ shared Cook’s reluctance to engage in personal criticism but managed to find a way round it with measured tones and sometimes a little exasperation. It didn’t destroy his relationship with players, who respected his innate fairness and deep love of the game.Though not even CMJ could avoid all controversy – his biggest brush with it came in Barbados, where England’s tour proper starts on Wednesday with the first Test at Bridgetown. It was 1990 and England were, incredibly, leading the series 1-0 going into the fourth Test and West Indies were in the unfamiliar position of rubbing their heels on the ropes.CMJ was in the commentary box when late in the afternoon Rob Bailey was given out caught down the legside by the umpire Lloyd Barker after Viv Richards had embarked on an extravagant celebration. CMJ pondered on air that a very good umpire had cracked under pressure.The local reaction was firecracker hot – with accusations of whinging, colonialism and racism. CMJ was banned from the Voice of Barbados, who held a day-long phone in on the matter, the local newspaper reported on “biased Brits” and Barker issued a writ for defamation. When play restarted after the rest day, crowds protested outside the ground, with placards suggesting that prison might be a suitable punishment.CMJ was horrified and apologised to Barker but the whole scene left an unpleasant taste on what was a tumultuous tour (which West Indies went on to win 2-1). The writ was settled two years later and bygones slowly became bygones.Barbados was also the scene of another, more amusing CMJ moment. Vic Marks remembers him being lent a rather upmarket set of golf clubs. “As he was driving through Bridgetown in a mini moke he had the bag lodged in the back. CMJ could be an erratic driver which may have contributed to the sad fact that one by one the clubs bounced out of the bag on to the road without him noticing. He was crestfallen when discovering their disappearance, and when broadcasting on the local station the following day at the Test match he made a plaintive appeal that any stray golf clubs that had been found on the streets of Bridgetown might be returned to him at the Kensington Oval. But none were forthcoming.”And it was in West Indies, though Jamaica not Barbados, that the best CMJ story of all took place. CMJ was on the golf course when he tried to phone the office with an urgent message – using the TV remote control from his room. That, at least, is a step Cook is unlikely to replicate.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Saracens had a pre-season friendly. She was still recovering from an operation, so didn’t play, but spent the day running out the water bottles. They won handily, and afterwards everyone went to the pub. It was the first time the whole squad had been back together since they won the Premiership final three months earlier. “Everyone’s spirits were really good,” Packer says. She had two drinks. “I didn’t really think about it, I didn’t feel drunk or anything like that, I was just in a good mood. We all were.” And then she drove home.It’s a long way from Saracens’ home ground to Packer’s house in Twickenham and she was most of the way there when it happened. Coming down the Kew Road she saw a car come rushing up to a junction ahead. She was sure it was going to pull out, so she swerved into the other lane to avoid it. Her van clipped the back of an oncoming car, the airbags exploded, and her van smacked into the kerb. Through the shock, she felt certain she wasn’t hurt, so she unbuckled herself, opened the door and ran around behind to check on the people in the car she had hit. Mercifully, they were fine too.The police came quickly. They asked Packer whether she had been drinking, she said yes, earlier in the evening. They took her to the station in Kingston. “And at this point,” she says, “every possibility was going through my head.” She started to think about the damage she had done, about the embarrassment she had caused her partner, who works in the police force, and about all the other people she had let down, her bosses at the plumbing company, who owned the van, her coaches and teammates at Saracens and England, her mother, and her grandparents.“I thought it was all over. I’d lose my job and lose my rugby, lose the thing I love doing, the thing I strive to be better at every day of my life. There’s no feeling in the world like putting on that white shirt with that red rose. It doesn’t matter whether you’re playing in any other country or here at Twickenham, there’s just no better feeling.” And now, she was sure, she would never have it again. “The thought of never playing for England again, not because of any injury, or because there’s better players, but because of a terrible decision that I made, it was the worst feeling in the world.”Packer, now 29, is still anguished about it, months later. It seems to me that while she ought to hate her mistake, she should count her blessings too. Be glad no one was hurt or worse. But instead she seems to be tormented by what the mistake cost, and the thought of what she almost lost. “My whole livelihood, my happiness, everything.” She is clearly nervous about doing this interview, and answers in those long monologues people use when they are recalling traumatic events.Packer started playing when she was five. She grew up in Yeovil, the youngest child of a single mum. “The mother of one of my friends from school took us to the rugby club and my mum thought we were just going to be watching so she dressed me up in a red top that had these crinkle frills around the neck and arms.” She hated it, but “it was one of those tops your mum loves to put you in”. When she came home later that afternoon it was caked in so much mud that her mum threw it straight in the bin. “I never had to wear that red top again,” she says. “Result.”From then on, it was football every Saturday and rugby every Sunday. “I’ve got a little bit of ‘no fear’ in me and that’s always shone out.” She played mixed rugby all the way through to the second year of secondary school, “when I stepped out of hockey so I could go play rugby with the boys,” she says. “One of my old coaches from back then always texts me before a big game, and she puts a hashtag on the end of her messages: #onlyagirl. Because that’s what they used to say when I played against the boys: ‘She’s only a girl: you can tackle her.’” They couldn’t.In a way Packer’s England career started when she made a similar mistake to the one she was sure had finished it for her. In 2007, just after she had got her licence, she was charged with drink-driving. “I was a very different person back then,” she says. “A lot can happen in 11 years of a person’s life. And for me that was a very different situation I got myself into. But it was a massive wake-up call. It made me realise that being an international rugby player was what I really wanted.” Twelve years later, the back-rower has 59 caps and a World Cup winner’s medal.Now, she felt, “it’s all over, I’m going to never play for England again, I’m going to have 59 caps for England and it’s done.” She was so ashamed that she did not tell anyone what had happened. “My mum knew, my partner, a close friend.” She dreaded telling the rest of her family and friends, all the people “that are really proud of me”. Especially her grandparents. “My nan who I’m really close to, I speak to her every few days, whereas in this time I’d been speaking to her much less. She knew there was something up, but she didn’t know what and I wasn’t telling her.”Eventually the England squad met up for what they call a values day. “I couldn’t be planning for this future when I had this hanging over me and I’m not being honest about it,” Packer says. “But I just didn’t really know how to tell people.” She finally spoke to the forwards coach, Richard Blaze. “A few words came out of his mouth. Idiot was definitely one of them. Then he said: ‘Have you spoken to anyone?’ And I said: ‘I don’t really know how to,’ but he told me I had to.Other players have been dropped for similar offences. In 2012 Danny Care was cut from the England squad when he was caught drink-driving. But the RFU decided that Packer needed their support. “I think for the RFU the thing was it’s something that was dealt with away from rugby, it was dealt with in the courts, and that’s how they saw it, the punishment for me was I could lose my job, lose my livelihood, I wouldn’t be able to get around to training. I think for them to support me, to say we’re not going to punish you in your rugby, is massive. But it’s not been an easy ride, don’t think they’ve not given me the talking to that I’ve needed.”She was eventually banned from driving for 17 months and fined £461. When the news finally came out England were in the middle of their autumn series. “It was soul destroying.” Packer has been an amateur most of her life, she didn’t play the game for money, but love. Which might be why this affected her so much. But soon after she resigned from the plumbing job, and took up a full-time contract with England. It is a new start. Now all she is thinking about is England’s first match of the Six Nations, against Ireland in Dublin, a week on Friday.“I made a couple of resolutions,” she says. “I’m currently on dry January, which is something I thought I’d do. And I’ve given up chocolate too. And I’m trying to be more positive, not to dwell on the negatives, just keep looking forward. I’m a bit more of a senior player now. If you’d asked me five years ago I’d have said: ‘Yeah I’m going to play rugby forever,’ but now I’m in my latter stages of playing for England. So I want to make sure I grab it all and never let go of it until it’s the right time. And I don’t know how long I’ve got left, but I want to make the most of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec39f75b5b0799f8862d2a6c39d898d43b287c8e/0_209_3367_2020/master/3367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=654eb7630a1c780428091d7cb092e292","title":"nfl officiating nfc championship game rules analysts","story":"Former officials were picking over controversial decisions on Championship Sunday, a sign that things had gone badly awry for the leagueHere is one statistic you won’t find in the official game book from Sunday’s AFC Championship Game: it took 59 minutes in real time to complete the last eight minutes and 39 seconds of the fourth quarter. All the more time for ad breaks selling pickup trucks and building drama with men who have become central to NFL broadcasts, the “rules analysts.”The Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots combined to score 31 points in that , but the game was also stopped four times so critical plays could be reviewed by the replay official. The longest stretch came when play grinded to a halt for seven minutes while officials reviewed New England receiver Justin Edelman’s apparent muffed handling of a punt, which the Chiefs, trailing 17-14 at the time, recovered at the New England 28-yard line.Needing to dissect the play in microscopic detail, but also maybe to fill air time, CBS showed no fewer than 12 replays of that play in those seven minutes, trying to determine if the ball had glanced off Edelman’s gloved thumb, or his shoulder, or maybe even his forearm.Just then Clete Blakeman, the referee, popped onto the TV screen and announced that the ruling on the field was a muff, with Kansas City regaining possession. To the delight of the Arrowhead Stadium crowd, Gehrig Dieter had scooped up the ball after it hit, or did not hit, and ran with it into the end zone, but a muff can’t be advanced, so there would be no touchdown.Summoning Gene Steratore, the former NFL official who is in his first season as CBS’s NFL rules analyst, the play-by-play man Jim Nantz said, “There’s got to be enough visual evidence to overturn it!”“Most definitely, Jim, the point is well-taken,” Steratore said, sounding like he was on a witness stand. “The ruling on the field is that he did touch it. So something must be clear and obvious” to overturn the call. Five commercials followed. Blakeman finally announced that the ball had not touched Edelman. After all that, it was New England’s ball.Because instant replay, reintroduced in 1999, had become such a vital part of officiating a game – a football field covers 57,600 square feet, and seven officials can’t be expected to cover every inch – Fox hired a former official, Mike Pereira, as the first NFL rules analyst in 2010. Pereira’s first tough call involved a game in which he said on the air that an apparent last-minute touchdown catch by Detroit’s Calvin Johnson would be overturned by replay officials, which it was. The referee in that game was none other than Steratore.Each of the three networks that carries NFL games now has a rules analyst. Pereira even has a helper in Dean Blandino, another former official. The rules analyst’s job is to explain succinctly why the refs made the call they did, sometimes softly suggesting that the refs messed up.For the heightened scrutiny they are under, the refs do a pretty good job. Coaches have challenged 10 calls in 10 playoff games this year, and six calls have been upheld after video review. The calls on only six other plays in 10 games have been reversed by the replay official. According to the NFL, replay reversals dropped to 172 in the 2018 regular season from 196 in the 2017 regular season, with challenges falling to 349 to 429 in that , suggesting that coaches might have more confidence that the officials are making the right tough calls.But coaches – like Saints coach Sean Payton, to use a recent example – still think officials miss tough judgment calls. The most consequential play in Sunday’s NFC Championship game, won by the Rams, is memorialized in the game book simply like this: 3-10-LA 13 (1:49) (Shotgun) D.Brees pass incomplete short right to T.Lewis.What was not noted was that Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis was barreled into by Nickell Robey-Coleman of the Rams as Lewis turned to make the catch. It was clearly a defensive pass-interference penalty that would have resulted in a first down with less than two minutes left that could have essentially led to a victory for New Orleans.“That should have been a penalty!” analyst Troy Aikman hollered on Fox. “Sean Payton is justifiably upset!”Pereira was on referee-analysis duty for Fox on Sunday. No penalty was called on a pass that was ruled incomplete, and coaches are not allowed to challenge a judgment call, nor can they be reviewed by a replay official. The Washington Post reported Monday that the NFL is considering adding pass-interference calls subject to replay review.Pereira said he agreed with Aikman, then added, “I know it’s easy in slow-motion. They’re close to bang-bang, but that’s way early enough – even high contact on the receiver. You could have had a foul either way,” either pass interference or illegal contact.Wil Lutz gave the Saints a 23-20 lead with a field goal, but the Rams would have been forced to spend their last time out had New Orleans been awarded a first down, making a game-tying drive substantially more difficult. The Rams tied the game and won in overtime.The Saints-Rams game was not bogged down by either a coach’s challenge or a replay reversal. Pereira had much less to talk about Sunday than Steratore. The fact that these “rules analysts” have become a cottage industry, though, suggests that the NFL has a problem.Referees are people, and even seven of the sharpest people in the business can’t see everything that unfolds on a 1.32-acre football field. Perhaps just scoring plays should be reviewed by a replay official, and the refs can be left to figure everything else out.Or maybe there should be no refs, and everything would be judged on cameras. But that would leave Gene Steratore and Mike Pereira out of a job, and no extra time to sell more beer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/796846dd5a1a3d703bfaec3d700aaf9351f20984/0_159_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ace6535735e3120d463424822df8314b","title":"stefanos tsitsipas rafael nadal frances tiafoe bautista agut australian open","story":"The nailed-on star of this 2019 Australian Open is the 20-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas and his chances of creating more history improved marginally when Rafael Nadal failed to dispel concerns about his fitness before their semi-final despite wiping the court with Frances Tiafoe 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 on day nine of the Australian Open.When someone pointed out to the Spaniard after his impressive win over the exciting young American that he had tape on his abdomen – not far from the area of his body that gave up on him when he quit during the fifth set of his quarter-final against Marin Cilic last year – Nadal was unamused.“I am in the semi-finals,” he said. “It is not the day to talk about this. Thank you very much for your worry. Things happen during the tournament, that’s all.”Perhaps. But Nadal has a wretched record of pulling out of tournaments or retiring over the past year. Doubts are at least reasonable, and he was candid enough to admit: “Of course there have been some troubles in a row, not easy situations. Last thing was in Abu Dhabi, I didn’t have the chance to play in Brisbane. It was, of course, a tough moment. At the same time, it has been positive that I felt myself playing well, practising well.”If Nadal is not in prime shape, Tsitsipas is good enough to find him out. If the tape is a mere precaution, Nadal is still capable of destroying an ingenu such as Tsitsipas, and it could be one-sided.There is a considerable fanbase growing around the charismatic Greek player with the single-handed backhand and the multi-layered brain. He is different, a relaxed and attractive thinker who says there is more to life than tennis, yet gives the impression he would drive himself to the extremities of collapse to win a big match. Nadal might force him to go to that place.“He really announced himself on the grandest stage after beating Roger Federer,” Annabel Croft said on Eurosport after watching him beat Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2).That’s a fair summary. Championships are not won in a blaze of bright light, but in the persistent heat of a long campaign. Nadal has done that so many times and Tsitsipas is not remotely familiar with the pressure of winning seven best-of-five matches in a row against the best players in the world, yet he got the better of his Spanish opponent almost through sheer force of will.He definitely has something about him. It is not just his sumptuous ground strokes, big serve and willingness to risk all by charging the net. He makes mistakes, but he makes them honestly – and he talks with candour about his learning journey.Asked if he surprised himself by the level of his tennis, he said: “A little bit, yeah. You think your opponent is going to do some extraordinary things – and Roberto was playing great today. He showed some good tennis the entire week. But, at the end, it’s completely different to what I can picture before going on the court – how you can imagine how your opponent is going to play. What I realised recently is, your opponent feels the exact same thing you feel.”One person who reckons Tsitsipas might be feeling different at the end of his semi-final against Nadal is Patrick Mouratoglou, who is half-Greek and has entertained him at his Riviera academy since spotting his potential three years ago.“Stefanos’s progress since he joined us in the south of France has been exceptional,” Mouratoglou, who also coaches Serena Williams, told tennishead.net. “At the start of this year, most of the top players probably knew very little about Stefanos. They do now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4afb1b9124a8daaab8ef84cbe50b6cda2a262b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4136b1d82743b2caf4bd722e082a8203","title":"everything you ever wanted to know about veganism","story":"Thinking of going vegan, but not sure whether it will suit your lifestyle? Basil Kronfli, who has been vegan for two years, gives us the lowdown on the pros, cons and quirks of an animal-free diet …Do you actually like the taste of vegan food?Absolutely. I love foods such as peanut butter, dark chocolate, hummus, falafel, roast potatoes, berries and mangos – which are all vegan. It’s actually much easier to eat vegan than I thought it would be when I made the switch two years ago.Are there any grey areas with some vegan foods?Honey is as tricky as it is sticky, and really ides the vegan community. On the one hand, it’s an animal product and vegans don’t eat animal products. On the other, beekeepers are actually helping bee populations – which have been dwindling in recent years – so supporting them by eating honey could be seen as a good deed for the bees. What makes things even more complicated is the fact that when beekeepers harvest the honey, they replace it with a sugar syrup that lacks the essential micronutrients of honey and isn’t as healthy for bees. Basically, it’s complicated.Do you feel like you miss out on sweet treats such as chocolate and ice-cream?It’s such a misconception that being vegan means you can’t have indulgent foods. Bourbon biscuits, golden syrup, boiled sweets, sorbets and dark chocolate are all vegan (to name but a few), and more and more sweet vegan treats are entering the market.For instance, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s now has vegan versions of three of its most popular ice-creams: Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Chunky Monkey and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies. It’s also just released a new vegan flavour: Coconutterly Caramel’d.What’s the most challenging thing about being vegan?I love baking, and not being able to use eggs can be pretty tricky. Baking vegan treats is getting easier, but when you’ve baked with eggs your whole life, getting used to replacements can be challenging, especially as there’s no one-size-fits-all solution.Where do you get your protein?Plenty of wholefoods pack a healthy dose of protein. Soy, pulses and nuts are just a few examples you can easily get in your daily diet. Going for Japanese food? Get a bowl of edamame and you’ll hit your daily requirement in no time. Increasingly, vegan protein supplements are really easy to access, too – brown rice protein is one of the most popular vegan proteins and is a great alternative for those avoiding soy.Are there any health downsides?There are a couple of vitamins and minerals you will probably want to supplement if you make the switch. The most talked about is vitamin B12. The reason this is lacking from most vegan diets comes down to the quality of soil in vegetables we eat today compared with pre-commercial farming soil. Other optional supplements can come from food. Mushrooms, for example, pack plenty of vitamin D. Flax seeds have the essential fatty acids vegans won’t be getting from fish, broccoli has biotin, while tomatoes have lycopene.What’s eating out as a vegan like?There’s plenty of choice in the UK. Loads of popular chain restaurants now have vegan menus or, at the very least, a couple of vegan options. When you go farther afield, especially on the continent, the meat and cheese can get a bit relentless, but there’s an excellent app that can help with that. It’s called HappyCow and it matches you with suitable eateries nearby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f833f6ac56e9bf3f62efb7b0205e52fd150e6da/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e998fd0bb645a9c588ee4c38fec66994","title":"danny dyer right royal family from tinpot wideboy to tv treasure","story":"Ten years ago the thought of Dyer fronting a show about the monarchy would have been laughable. Now it might just be the TV highlight of the springImagine if Danny Dyer had made Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family a decade ago. Everyone would have hated it. The thought of 2009-era Dyer – in the midst of a spate of brain-breaking documentaries like Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men, Football Hooligans International and Danny Dyer: I Believe in UFOs – would have been comprehensively depressing.The thought of the squeaky little cartoon wideboy – star of Malice In Wonderland, don’t forget – dressing up like an extra from Wolf Hall, if Wolf Hall had been about people you avoid sitting near on the bus, and larking about would have been too much to take. And yet Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family is out this week, and it’s probably going to be one of the highlights of the spring.Of course it will. Because Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family is essentially a two-part spin-off of his peerless 2016 Who Do You Think You Are? episode. As you’re already aware, that episode turned the entire format of Who Do You Think You Are? on its head. What was once a remarkably dry series about beloved actors whispering the word “Oh” at a book then forcing out a couple of dusty tears suddenly became a full-on joyride. It was like watching a fish out of water comedy Danny Dyer v the entire British aristocracy.The hope is that Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family will mine the same gold. It will see Dyer dress up in medieval clothes, learn about his history as a blood relative of King Edward III and – if the trailer is any indication – shout “You want some?” at a turnip. There’s a chance, of course, that the whole thing will end up being an undercooked mess, but that probably won’t matter. Dyer is too much of a national treasure to let something like that get in his way.It’s incredible how untouchable Dyer has become. At the start of the decade he’d become a howling parody of himself, playing characters called things like Bing and Whitey in a succession of miserable straight-to-DVD Brit-flicks and featuring in ghostwritten lad’s mag columns about the benefits of mutilating your ex-girlfriend’s face. He was a wet fart, a bad joke.But look at him now. He’s a beloved EastEnders actor, essentially just playing a more palatable version of himself to a loyal audience of millions. He ran away with the late-night version of Good Morning Britain that aired during the World Cup, verbalising his frustration with Brexit in a way that professional pundits could not and correctly identifying David Cameron as the root of all our troubles. He delivered the Alternative Christmas Message on Christmas Day. His daughter won Love Island, for crying out loud. He’s part of an actual dynasty.My big fear is that he’s going to lean into this newfound love too hard, just like he did back when he wanted to be a tinpot football hooligan. The danger is that TV executives will start using him as their bit of rough, the jester they wheel out so everyone can laugh at his funny accent. That would reduce him to a token cockney caricature, and rob him of his authenticity. And his authenticity is exactly why people are drawn to him.It’s a fine line, and one he needs to watch closely. In the meantime, though, there’s a show about him wearing a crown and shouting at vegetables on TV this week. Don’t pretend you aren’t going to watch it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b41f3c96a5e84385a420bfcf76301ae29bc135f/0_91_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0840121c901815f0fa33da302db9b8e9","title":"dna study debunks rudolf hess imposter theory","story":"Comparison of samples from inmate Spandau #7 and Hess relative finds a match A longstanding conspiracy theory that the Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess was replaced by a doppelganger in prison has been debunked.For years, there were rumours that the prisoner known as Spandau #7 at the Berlin jail was an impostor substituted in to take the place of the deputy Führer of the Third Reich.But now scientists say analysis of blood samples from Spandau #7 and a living relative of Hess has put an end to the theory. The inmate was Hess after all.“No match would have supported the impostor theory, but finally we got a match,” said Prof Jan Cemper-Kiesslich, of the University of Salzburg, a co-author of the research.Hess was captured after a solo flight and parachute landing in Scotland in 1941, where he apparently hoped to negotiate a peace deal. He was held at various locations including the Tower of London before being tried at Nuremberg and given a life sentence.He arrived at Spandau in 1947 and remained there until his apparent suicide in 1987, by which point he was the jail’s sole prisoner. But an enduring rumour before Hess even reached Spandau was that the inmate was a doppelganger. The study’s authors say his doctor at Spandau prison was among those who believed the theory, pointing to doubts about his journey to Scotland, his refusal to see relatives until 1969 and his “claimed amnesia”.The theory was also believed in the highest echelons of political life, including by the former US president Franklin Roosevelt. Hess’s family, however, disputed the idea.Writing in the journal Forensic Science International Genetics, Cemper-Kiedslich and colleagues report that their conclusion is based on analysis of a blood sample taken from Spandau #7 in 1982. The sample was hermetically sealed on a microscope slide kept for years for teaching purposes by another of the study’s authors, Rick Wahl, a former US army pathologist.It was a fortunate situation: Hess’s body was disinterred and cremated in 2011 to avoid his grave becoming a site of pilgrimage for neo-Nazis.The team tracked down a distant male relative of Hess, whose identity they are careful to protect. According to the New Scientist, which first reported on the study, the man agreed to give a DNA sample and the team compared it with that of Spandau #7.With Y-chromosomes passed down from father to son, that offered the possibility of a different analysis. “Persons with an unbroken paternal line display the same set of DNA markers on the Y chromosome,” said Cemper-Kiesslich.The authors say the people who carried out the analysis were unaware of the story of the samples until after the results were in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a8d2d30386022bab48aac9fbea4ac2c83618eb/351_28_3901_2341/master/3901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28855aca9e7549b88c33a31a0057f963","title":"france summons italian envoy over hostile africa remarks","story":"Italian deputy PM blames migrant crisis on France’s ‘colonisation’ of AfricaFrance’s foreign ministry has summoned the Italian ambassador in an escalating row over migrant arrivals in Europe that pits the centrist government of Emmanuel Macron against Italy’s far-right-populist coalition.Teresa Castaldo was summoned over “hostile” remarks made by the Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio.Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), told a rally in the central Abruzzo region on Sunday: “If today people are leaving Africa is it because some European countries, with France taking the lead, have never stopped colonising tens of African states?”He called on the EU to sanction France for “impoverishing Africa” and for migrants to be taken to the southern French port of Marseille instead of Italy. An estimated 170 people were feared to have drowned in the Mediterranean in two incidents at the weekend as they tried to make their way to Europe from Libya.Sources told the Ansa news agency the remarks were “hostile and without cause given the partnership between France and Italy in the European Union”.This is the latest fight Italy has picked against France since M5S came to power in coalition with the far-right League last June.Di Maio has never quite forgiven the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for speaking about “populist leprosy” in a reported criticism of the Italian government shortly after it was formed. Earlier this month, he urged France’s gilets jaunes, who have held several violent anti-government protests since early December, to “not give up”.Italy also summoned the French ambassador after Macron criticised Italy for “cynicism and irresponsibility” when the country’s leaders turned away a migrant rescue ship with more than 600 people onboard weeks after coming to power.Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, added fuel to the fire on Tuesday morning, saying France was not looking to bring calm to violence-ravaged Libya because its energy interests there rivalled those of Italy.“There are countries that steal wealth from Africa and France is definitely one of them,” Salvini said on Italian TV. “France has no interest in making Libya a better place. Paris is interested in taking control of the oil there. And their interests are opposed to the Italian ones. I’m proud to govern a generous country. We don’t take lessons on humanity from France, let alone from Macron.“In recent years, France turned back thousands of migrants, including women and children. They took them back to Italy in the middle of the night, like animals. Again, I don’t take lesson from Macron.”A French diplomatic source told Reuters it was not the first time that Salvini had made such comments and that it was probably because he felt he had been upstaged by Di Maio. The source added that the accusation was baseless and reiterated that French efforts in Libya were aimed at stabilising the country, preventing the spread of terrorism and curbing the migration flows.Both Salvini and Di Maio are campaigning hard for European parliamentary elections in May and are eager to show they have broken with the consensual politics of centre-left and centre-right parties. The two men have repeatedly targeted neighbouring France and accused the French president of doing nothing to help handle the hundreds of thousands of mainly African migrants who have reached Italy from Libya in recent years.Additional reporting by Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23620e0dfcd1da019b8c01f107a9367cff1e25ba/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bc41d193cd482bef576da0cb6b0f8e7","title":"mnangagwa promises investigation of brutal zimbabwe crackdown","story":"Security forces apparently targeted opposition and union officials during fuel protestsZimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has called for “national dialogue” and promised an investigation into widespread violence by security forces in recent days, after cutting short an overseas trip.The brutal crackdown followed protests last week against the doubling of the fuel price, which led to rioting and sporadic looting.The military and police appear to have targeted officials and supporters of mainstream opposition parties, as well as union officials and high-profile civil society activists, rather than alleged thieves.At least 12 people were killed and 78 treated for gunshot wounds, according to the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, which recorded more than 240 incidents of assault and torture. About 700 people have been arrested and remain in custody, including five opposition MPs.On Tuesday, the government-appointed Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission issued a highly critical report, saying at least eight people had been killed and soldiers and police had instigated “systematic torture”.The commission said armed soldiers and police had visited many homes at night to give “indiscriminate beatings” to men and boys as young as 11.“Torture was perpetrated through beating the men with baton sticks on their backs while they lay on the ground,” it said, adding that attack dogs were used and victims were often too scared to seek medical attention.The violence was the most extensive since the 37-year authoritarian rule of Robert Mugabe ended in November 2017 with a military takeover, and has dashed any hopes for political reform.Mnangagwa returned to Harare on Monday night, curtailing a visit to Europe and central Asia to drum up investment.Human rights organisations said raids were continuing in the early hours of Tuesday, though internet and social media sites appeared to be partially returning to normal after being shut down by authorities for several days.There was also more traffic in the centre of major cities, but a significant number of soldiers remained on the streets.Mnangagwa, who won a contested election in July, said insubordination among security forces was intolerable and “if required, heads will roll”.“Violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe,” the president said in a statement released on social media. “Chaos and insubordination will not be tolerated. Misconduct will be investigated.”He also criticised the protests last week.“Everyone has the right to protest, but this was not a peaceful protest. Wanton violence and cynical destruction, looting police stations, stealing guns and uniforms, incitement and threats of violence. This is not the Zimbabwean way,” said Mnangagwa, a ruling Zanu-PF party stalwart who has been advised on his communications by a team of international consultants.Opposition officials were unimpressed by the president’s offer of dialogue, which they called a “gimmick to buy time”.“Mnangagwa’s overtures are always on Twitter. He knows where we are, yet he has chosen not to talk to us directly,” said Jacob Mafume, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.Nelson Chamisa, the leader of the MDC, said his attempts at dialogue had been “spurned and mocked” and people must be free to talk without fear.Mnangagwa also defended the raising of the fuel price, saying it was “not a decision we took lightly. But it was the right thing to do.”Fuel in Zimbabwe is heavily subsidised and officials have said the money saved by the increase will be redirected to buying essential commodities.The protests were stoked by chronic daily shortages of banknotes, fuel, food and medicine.Mnangagwa had visited Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan before cutting short his trip, which had included attending the Davos summit of world leaders this week.After Mugabe’s rule ended, there had been widespread optimism that the repression of previous decades was over. The crisis has attracted fierce criticism from western states and will undermine Zimbabwe’s efforts to rejoin the international community.The US, the UK, the EU and the UN human rights office criticised the government’s reaction to the unrest.The army and police denied any wrongdoing, saying some of those who raided homes and beat people were impostors wearing stolen uniforms.Analysts are ided over whether the crisis provides further evidence of splits within Zanu-PF and the government’s highest officials.The vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, a hardline former army general, was in charge while Mnangagwa was away. He was blamed for deploying soldiers who shot six civilians in Harare two days after the election last year.Some observers believe Chiwenga is impatient with the more moderate line taken by Mnangagwa, who they say is keen to win international legitimacy.Others believe the president and his deputy have adopted a carefully coordinated “good cop, bad cop” strategy, which allows for repression domestically without tarnishing Mnangagwa’s reputation overseas."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3766738.1548169473!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck campaigner orla church was witty intelligent forceful","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Charlie and Maureen, parents of Orla Church,   leaving the church at Donnycarney, Dublin, surrounded by family members, nieces and nephews. Photograph Nick Bradshaw for The Orla Church, one of the 221 women caught up in the CervicalCheck controversy, was remembered at her funeral on Tuesday as a feisty daughter, sister and aunt who revelled in family debates, Sunday lunches and had a pronounced fondness for red wine.Ms Church (54), who died on January 19th, was the 21st woman to die arising out of the CervicalCheck smear tests scandal. Her High Court legal action against the Health Service Executive and the United States laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, was contested but settled, after mediation and without admission of liability, days before her death.A member of the 221+ CervicalCheck Patient Support Group, Ms Church was a low-key campaigner. She worked with the HSE on devising guidance for doctors and with the Irish Cancer Society but was less in the public eye that other high-profile campaigners such as Vicky Phelan and Emma Mhic Mhathúna.Her plain wooden coffin, dressed with a spray of white lilies and greenery, was led into the church by her seven nieces, Ciara, Alexandra, Ellen, Rachel, Sofia, Gabrielle and Ruby, to the strains of Joy of My Heart, played by the ensemble Encore Occasions.The only reason people grieved, said Father Vasyl Kornitsky, “is because we love”.The symbols of her life included a portrait photograph of herself wearing a striking bright red top and white skirt, a photo of all her nieces and nephews to whom she was devoted, and a ceramic hedgehog, an acknowledgement of her great love of animals.She would take in wounded pigeons and sea gulls, said David, stray cats and hedgehogs to such an extent that her garden resembled a zoo. When a hedgehog disappeared once, she printed “missing” posters and put them up in the neighbourhood – to good effect.A neighbour rang, said David, and “Hedgie” was returned to the garden “where he lived happily ever after”.Ms Church loved art galleries, Chez Max restaurant, and her friends. With colleagues from the Central Bank where she worked, she sang in a choir named Bank Notes.She loved to travel, said David, and for a time in her late teens she lived in France. While there, she developed a fondness for French cooking, especially the use of cream and garlic, and for French wine.“But she was very open minded,” said David, “and loved wine from other countries too.”She “had an opinion on everything.”“She really enjoyed debating, or an argument as she would call it. She won most of them . . . Her legendary Sunday dinners were not to be missed.”His sister had lived for five years in London up to 1994 and it was a testament to the friendships she made then that, 25 years later, so many of those friends had travelled to her funeral.He spoke of his sister’s reaction to her situation.“Orla campaigned behind the scenes for the improvement of health services for women. Even when she knew it was too late to change her own fate, she worked alongside health professionals creating guidelines for doctors . . . I know Orla would take due comfort in knowing that the work she was involved in will make a difference in the lives of women in the future.”In his homily, Fr Kornitsky spoke of God’s love.“God knows every single sorrow of our lives,” he said, “every beat of our hearts.”Jesus had taken Orla “into His beautiful arms in the beautiful mansion that He had prepared for her,” he said.Her coffin was escorted from the church by her nephews, Stephen, Darragh, Matthew, Charlie and Callum, followed by her parents, chief mourners Charlie and Maureen Church.Music included Over the Rainbow, The Lord is My Light and My Help, Ave Maria, Songbird, Pie Jesu, To Where You Are, Down to the River to Play, and The Parting Glass.After her funeral Mass, Ms Church was laid to rest at Balgriffin Cemetery."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765708.1548098450!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sligo on brexit now it feels more like a game of russian roulette","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSabine Walsh and Noel Mulkeen at the Build Block business centre in Sligo. Photograph: Brian FarrellHaving opened a new Ford car dealership in Castlebaldwin, Co Sligo, in August, brothers David and Ray Porter are acutely aware of how the Brexit-inspired slump in the value of sterling is affecting the Irish motor trade.When they were setting up the business, the brothers approached a number of dealers in Northern Ireland and told them they would be in the market for a supply of cars if they got a good price.“They said: ‘Why would we price them well for you when we have busloads of people coming up every weekend to look at cars?’ ” says David, an accountant by profession. The trip across the Border to window-shop for cars, once sterling started to slide, had become a regular outing for many in the Republic, he believes.“It was a day out where you’d go to the North, do some shopping, get some alcohol, buy a car,” he says.The trend is reflected in statistics for last year, which saw a record 100,755 used imports being registered in the Republic (up 7.8 per cent on 2017). That compared with total new car sales in 2018 of 125,486 (down 4.4 per cent on the previous year).In Co Sligo there were more imports registered last year than new sales – 1,355 compared with 1,085.As far as the Porters are concerned, the biggest impact of Brexit so far is that people are hesitating to opt for a new car, mainly because the trade-in value of their old car is being affected by the huge volume of imports. “I can’t, for example, value a trade-in at €10,000 if someone beside me can import and sell something similar from the UK for €8,000,” says David.Another reason why the motor industry is so vulnerable to Brexit , he points out, is that there are so few countries in the EU where motorists drive on the left. “We clearly cannot replace imports from the UK with imports from France.”He doesn’t believe the Government can do much more than it has been doing in the build-up to Brexit. “I think the Irish Government is in a difficult position, to be honest. I think absolutely there should be a backstop agreement by now. It is the middle of January and this is happening at the end of March, so a backstop agreement should exist.”The accountant’s gut feeling is that there will not be a “crash-out”in March as the stakes are too high for everyone.“In 2016 I was not that concerned as I thought the issue so big there would have to be a resolution. But now, as it comes closer to March, it feels more like a game of Russian roulette.”In the Building Block co-working hub in Sligo town, many in the tech sector seem unsure what Brexit will mean. Conflict resolution is Sabine Walsh’s speciality and she reckons it’s a skill that is sorely lacking in politics across the water. She work for London-based company Mediator Academy, which provides online courses in conflict resolution to clients around the world.“The uncertainty is the worst aspect,” says the qualified solicitor.“I don’t criticise the Irish Government. I don’t think there is much they can do because they don’t know what they are planning for. But the adversarial nature of the politics we see in Britain is what gets me.”Her personal background makes her worry about the future. “I am half German, and my entire childhood was about how the whole point of the EU was that the Holocaust would never happen again.”She believes a hard border would be “catastrophic” and would “play into hands of populists and nationalists”.As someone married to a sheep farmer, she also knows how concerned that sector is. “We have no idea what the implications are. I don’t think people realise the level of trade between Ireland and the UK on a day-to-day basis.”While a new regulatory framework will affect her work in London, she is even more worried about the implications for “peace and prosperity”.“People had started to take peace, security and prosperity for granted and have forgotten that 80 years ago the English and the Germans were killing each other,” she says.“And we take a lot for granted in terms of travel. I am sure a lot of people who voted for Brexit will still want to have their beach holidays in Spain.”She believes the Government must continue to push for a backstop. “I do not think people outside the island of Ireland really realise how fragile the peace in the North is and how easily that could erupt again. There is still no functioning assembly in Stormont because the DUP are too busy propping up the UK government.“I grew up in an era where every time you crossed the Border into Northern Ireland, people were shoving machines guns in our face. It is really not that long ago, and it is not going to take much to ide the community up there again.”Denise Mulvaney, a native of Grange, Co Sligo, had been working in the tech sector in London for 10 years but handed in her notice on the day the result of the Brexit referendum was announced. Although the exact timing was a coincidence, she had been feeling uneasy in London in the lead-up to the referendum.“There was a weird atmosphere,” she says. “I love London but it was a very stressful atmosphere because of the uncertainty.”The day she made the decision to return to Ireland, she was making her usual dash to pick up her child from childcare when there was an announcement that her train was cancelled because of a fatality on the track. Looking back, she believes that as the build-up to Brexit moved up a gear, suicides on the tube line started becoming much more frequent. “There was a few a month on my line alone.”She also noted an anti-immigrant attitude, even in her own office. “People would tell me I was not a ‘real’ immigrant because I was Irish, but they would say negative things about colleagues,” she says. “I felt the media was getting people to pick on each other. I felt we were all being played like puppets.”Mulvaney, a UX (user experience) consultant who describes herself as a problem solver for the tech industry, came home in August 2016 and set up her own company, Astara Creative. Since then lots of Irish expats have sought her advice about making the same move.She understands the interest but is not convinced that Brexit will be quite the horror story many are predicting. “I keep thinking of the millennium bug and all the media hype around that and the dire warnings, but our microwaves and our alarms clocks were still working at a minute past midnight.”She is not overly confident about the Government’s approach. “I struggle with the Government anyway on issues such as how they treat our civil servants and our nurses. And I do not feel Ireland has a loud enough voice in Europe I don’t feel they are representing the passion of the Irish people on this.”Noel Mulkeen, whose company, Uni.cam, produces videos for the education sector in the UK, Ireland and Germany, says some prospective British clients seemed “shell-shocked” following the vote in the House of Commons last week. “Much of their funding is EU-reliant and the uncertainty means their ability to budget and plan is seriously curtailed.”This obviously has implications for his company. As someone who benefited from the EU in both his personal and professional life, he has other concerns. “I studied in Sweden, met my wife there and my children are back and forth. We are Europeans. Britain pulling out of that culture is a backward step. But I believe that the people who voted for Brexit and for Trump did so because they felt hard done by. People felt neglected.”He thinks the Government has been right to press for the backstop. “From what I have seen they are doing a good job. My concern would be that they may have not done enough preparatory work for a crash-out. But I still think that is unlikely to happen and that there will be an extension rather than a crash out and it will drag on for six or 12 months.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

leaving to “passive overconsumption” of meals and snacks.Dame Sally told a debate in London: “When people are using screens or watching the television that their calorie intake goes up … because if you don’t concentrate on the food, the social interaction is fairly mindless and the feeling of satiation is not recognised as easily.”“We would like people to sit down and eat together and actually if you look at child development they need to interact with their families - with adults - and mealtimes are a very important part of that.“Proper meal times with healthy food are going to help our children develop effectively and probably help our waistlines,” she said.  Others at the event, hosted by think tank Reform, suggested Britain should attempt to emulate France, in its eating habits.Hugo Fry, managing director of pharmaceutical giant Sanofi said: “One of the reasons that drives the UK up the obesity charts is the way we eat - the environment we do it in.“We are massive TV eaters, grab-and-go eaters,” he said. “At the other end of the chart the French … sit down as a family at every single meal - breakfast lunch and dinner,” he said.Overweight parents are more likely to have overweight childrenTam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said a significant number of families do not even own a table.He said: “Prof Dame Sally Davies is absolutely right. The real problem is that we have too many families who cannot cook. So the easiest thing is to buy takeaways or ready meals and sit around the television and eat.“Families should make an effort to have the TV off around meal time and have a conversation while eating. It slows the speed of eating and means you wolf down fewer calories.”Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said:  “There is some evidence to suggest that watching screens can distract children from feeling full. What’s more, we know that children are often exposed to adverts for unhealthy food and drink whilst watching their favourite TV shows, which in turn can lead to higher calorie intake.Our screen time guidance recommends that parents and their children build screen time around positive family activities – such as sharing meals together. But with one in three children leaving primary school overweight or obese, it is clear that action is needed at a national level to tackle the childhood obesity problem. That’s why we want to see Government publish their consultation on restricting junk food marketing before the 9pm watershed on TV, with similar restrictions online, without delay, he said. The chief medical officer said she had embraced the label of “chief nanny” after years of being described as such.“It\u0027s good to be the chief nanny if it has an impact,” Dame Sally told the event, reiterating calls for extra taxes on sugary and salty snacks.“I am wearing my label with pride,” she said. However, she questioned whether a male chief medical officer would have attracted the same nickname, saying the issue “raised questions” about sexism.Advice or admonition | Dame Sally\u0026#039s previous warnings“We won\u0027t go there,” she continued. “Just make the changes and chief nanny will be happy.”And she urged politicians to listen to her calls to extend the sugar levy, extending taxes so they were placed on chocolates, sweets, and cakes as well as on milky drinks.“We need political will. If you look at outcomes think how many lives were saved by seat belts,” she said.“Think how many lives were saved by the smoking ban in public places. Think how many lives  could be saved by extending the sugar levy.

He has taught us so many lessons in life, not least to be kind.He worked incredibly hard and his favourite thing to do was to create magic for us in the kitchen at home.We will miss his calm, wonderful spirit, his cheeky sense of humour and his loving nature.Andrew Fairlie\u0026#39s restaurant at Gleneagles Hotel is the only one in Scotland with two Michelin starsHis father Jim revealed the news on Twitter, saying: It is with enormous sadness and grief that Kay and I announce the death of our beloved son Andrew.His wife Kate and his family have kept vigil with him for some weeks. He slipped away quietly this morning but his many achievements \u0026amp memory will live on.Nicola Sturgeon said it was a privilege to know the chef, adding: I\u0027m so sorry to hear that Andrew Fairlie has died. My deepest condolences to his family.Andrew is gone far too soon, but his achievements will always be remembered and his legacy will inspire the next generation of world class chefs.Fairlie won the first Roux Scholarship in 1984 and was named chef of the year at the 2018 Food and Travel Magazine Reader Awards.Mr Fairlie said after giving up the restaurant that knowing that he would “never have that buzz and atmosphere of the kitchen again” was very emotional. It was taken over by the head chef Stephen McLaughlin.Mr McLaughlin, current head chef of the restaurant, and general manager Dale Dewsbury said: We are heartbroken that Andrew has gone and our thoughts go out to Andrew\u0027s wife, Kate, and his family.Our sadness is matched only by our tremendous pride in all his achievements and our thankfulness that we had the opportunity to share in his life and career.We have lost our colleague, mentor and friend who was always on hand with great judgment, humour and inspiration.We will miss him terribly but will take strength and huge pride in continuing to burn the flame of outstanding cuisine, service and culture that he established.A memorial service is to be held later this year at Gleneagles Hotel.Please review our commenting policyChamps-Elysées bank heist took three and a half hours after robbers place \u0026#39closed\u0026#39 sign on front doorSoldier hid £260k of MoD money in his airing cupboard and forgot about it for four months, court martial hearsBrexit latest news: Eurosceptics urged to \u0026#39swallow their pride\u0026#39 and back Theresa May\u0026#39s deal in order to save BrexitDrunk man on Russian flight attempts to hijack plane Cardiff City\u0026#39s Emiliano Sala was on plane which disappeared over Channel, French authorities sayUS Supreme court lets Trump\u0026#39s transgender troop ban take effect Duke of Cambridge turns interviewer as he quizzes Sir David Attenborough at DavosDominic Grieve tables plan which would allow MPs to demand Article 50 extension just three days before Brexit deadlineWhat next for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal -

Late last year, Apple removed almost every mention of AirPower from its website, leading to fears it was being quietly erased from history.But the name still appeared in some unexpected places: the user guides for the latest iPhones make reference to it, some Apple job postings appear to suggest it is still being worked on, and one version of Apple\u0027s website made reference to it in reference to the company\u0027s new battery cases.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialNow numerous reports suggest AirPower has now entered production and could be released later this year.

But repeated rumours have suggested that Apple was in fact working to get AirPower out much earlier, but that technical issues had got in the way of making it available to the public.Those reports chime with similar claims earlier this month that AirPower was on its way and was making its way through Apple\u0027s supply chain. The beginning of production comes after Apple solved the technical issues – thought to be problems with overheating and other challenges – according to numerous reports.When Apple revealed AirPower in September 2017, promising it would be available soon, it showed a rounded charging mat that would allow people to charge phones and Apple Watches alongside AirPods in a special new case. But there has been no sign of the new product – with major events like the release of the iPhone XS and XR passing without a mention.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future.

How grave are the potential problems they face? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentLittle is black and white when it comes to BrexitBrexit is a potential headache for every sector, not least Northern Irish agriculture, which does a large amount of cross-border business with the Republic.One issue on the minds of those working in the farming\u0026nbspsector is: what will happen to UK agricultural produce sent for processing outside the country after Brexit?Will it still be possible for, say, farmers in Northern Ireland to export milk to the Republic of Ireland, for it to be processed there into milk powder, and then exported again to China with a “produce EU” quality stamp as it is at present?Or will a no-deal Brexit, in which the UK (including\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland) leaves the single market and customs union, upset that arrangement and potentially damage this\u0026nbspparticular industry?On balance, have we benefited from being in the EU?Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory says this is likely to be an issue of domestic labelling regulations, both in the EU and China.It hinges on what the regulations are on “produce EU” certification and whether UK milk dried in Ireland would qualify.Assuming no tariffs then UK milk from Northern Ireland will continue to be exported to the Republic. However, depending on the rules agreed, UK exporters will face some trade facilitation costs, for example... to prove that indeed the milk is from the UKEU food labelling regulations\u0026nbspas laid out on the European Commission’s website state that indication of the country or place of provenance shall be mandatory “where failure to indicate this might mislead the consumer as to the true country of origin or place of provenance of the food”.EU regulations also state that a non-EU\u0026nbspcountry of origin, which would be the UK after a no-deal Brexit, “must be\u0026nbspauthorised for introduction\u0026nbspof milk and milk products into the EU”.There’s a related issue known as “rules of origin” in trade.What would happen if a second referendum delivered another Leave vote?This is a requirement under various trade agreements that a certain minimum share of manufactured exports must be made up of local parts to qualify for zero tariffs.Yet Winters says agricultural produce rules of origin will not be the same as those that cover manufactured goods.His advice\u0026nbspfor all suppliers and exporters is to check with local customs and the relevant regulatory authorities rather than making any assumptions.Dr Carmen Hubbard, research leader for The UK in a Changing Europe group, says that another problem potentially facing Northern Irish milk exporters could be new border bureaucracy, even if we ultimately negotiate a free trade deal with the EU.“Assuming no tariffs then UK milk from Northern Ireland will continue to be exported to the Republic. However, depending on the rules agreed, UK exporters will face some trade facilitation costs, for example\u0026nbsppaperwork at the border, administrative and compliance costs which will be required to prove that indeed the milk is from the UK,” she says.The future of the agri-food sector certainly matters to many livelihoods on both sides of the Irish border.Employment in the Republic is estimated by InterTradeIreland to be around 230,000, with a figure of 26,000 given for Northern Ireland.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Almost\u0026nbsptwo-thirds of\u0026nbspgreenhouse gas emissions\u0026nbspare released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods to serve society’s needs, the report says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe now use 92.8 billion tonnes of minerals, fossil fuels, metals and biomass every year -\u0026nbspthree times as much as in 1970 -\u0026nbspwith a further doubling predicted by 2050. Yet most governments’ climate change strategies look primarily at measures such as renewable energy and barely consider creating a circular economy.The report calls on governments to take action to move from a linear “take-make-waste” economy to a circular one that maximises the use of existing assets, while reducing dependence on new raw materials and minimising waste. The Netherlands has set an example by introducing\u0026nbspa target of becoming 50 per cent\u0026nbspcircular by 2030 and 100 per cent\u0026nbspby 2050.\u0026nbspCircle Economy argues that innovation to extend the life of existing resources will not only curb emissions but also reduce social inequality and foster low-carbon growth. One example of how this could work in practice is construction in China where the majority of houses and roads people will use in the next 50 years have yet to be built. Trump’s EPA nominee says climate change ‘not the greatest crisis’Supreme Court refuses Exxon’s effort to keep years of documents secretClimate talks extended as US and other polluters hold up agreementThe researchers calculate that China’s built environment emits 3.7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases every year and is set to more than double in size by 2050, from 239 to 562 billion tonnes of material. Less than 2 per cent of China’s construction inputs are reused or recycled material, although this is improving. Increasing this proportion further can make a significant impact on emissions and help the world keep with the 1.5C maximum rise in temperature agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement.“A 1.5 degree world can only be a circular world,” Circle Economy’s chief executive, Harald Friedl, said.Applied systematically, circular business models would “tip the balance in the battle against global warming”, he said.“This will not only reduce emissions but also boost growth by making economies more efficient.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Almost\u0026nbsptwo-thirds of\u0026nbspgreenhouse gas emissions\u0026nbspare released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods to serve society’s needs, the report says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe now use 92.8 billion tonnes of minerals, fossil fuels, metals and biomass every year -\u0026nbspthree times as much as in 1970 -\u0026nbspwith a further doubling predicted by 2050. Yet most governments’ climate change strategies look primarily at measures such as renewable energy and barely consider creating a circular economy.The report calls on governments to take action to move from a linear “take-make-waste” economy to a circular one that maximises the use of existing assets, while reducing dependence on new raw materials and minimising waste. The Netherlands has set an example by introducing\u0026nbspa target of becoming 50 per cent\u0026nbspcircular by 2030 and 100 per cent\u0026nbspby 2050.\u0026nbspCircle Economy argues that innovation to extend the life of existing resources will not only curb emissions but also reduce social inequality and foster low-carbon growth. One example of how this could work in practice is construction in China where the majority of houses and roads people will use in the next 50 years have yet to be built. Trump’s EPA nominee says climate change ‘not the greatest crisis’Supreme Court refuses Exxon’s effort to keep years of documents secretClimate talks extended as US and other polluters hold up agreementThe researchers calculate that China’s built environment emits 3.7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases every year and is set to more than double in size by 2050, from 239 to 562 billion tonnes of material. Less than 2 per cent of China’s construction inputs are reused or recycled material, although this is improving. Increasing this proportion further can make a significant impact on emissions and help the world keep with the 1.5C maximum rise in temperature agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement.“A 1.5 degree world can only be a circular world,” Circle Economy’s chief executive, Harald Friedl, said.Applied systematically, circular business models would “tip the balance in the battle against global warming”, he said.“This will not only reduce emissions but also boost growth by making economies more efficient.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords.

But it went without any more updates until September 2018, and then disappeared from Apple\u0027s website when the new phones were added to it.Apple\u0027s to release three new iPhones –\u0026nbspwith three cameras eachApple hasn\u0027t mentioned the iPhone SE since, and it is not clear where its future now lies. The company never announced the death of the phone, but hasn\u0027t give any indication that it is still alive either.Rumours have continued to swirl about a possible iPhone SE 2, almost as long as the original has been available. In May of last year, there were suggestions that the summer could see the launch of an update – but various Apple events, including the release of the new iPhone XS and XR, came and went without a mention of the SE.The iPhone XR seems to fulfill some of the same purpose as the SE, packing in all of the newest technology into a cheaper handset. But it is actually larger than most of Apple\u0027s phones, sitting somewhere between the iPhone XS and XS Max.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nominations will be announced on Tuesday, 22 January the ceremony itself is set for roughly a month later, on Sunday, 24 February at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre. Here are our predictions for how the nominations will pan out in the main six categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor.The Oscars have the unique ability to nominate up to 10 films for Best Picture, over the traditional five entries – a format change first put in place a decade ago. The awards race has already narrowed itself down to two fierce competitors – Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma and Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born – but there will be plenty of room for other favourites here. Green Book, Vice, If Beale Street Could Talk, and The Favourite are all sure to pick up nominations.However, 2018 offered a stellar slate of films directed by women, all boasting the right amount of prestige for awards season, among them Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace. At this point, it would be\u0026nbspan embarrassing move, quite frankly,\u0026nbspfor the Academy to reveal a slate of 10 films all directed by men.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMost likely to make the cut is Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, a beautifully orchestrated character piece that will almost certainly land Richard E Grant a Supporting Actor nomination. Unfortunately, it’s likely to lose out to First Man. Damien Chazelle’s La La Land follow-up is an early frontrunner that’s since fallen by the wayside, but it still has clout to guarantee a few nominations. Although the Academy hasn’t filled the full 10 nominations since 2010, usually opting for a selection of nine, the list below is of the top 10 contenders in the category.Created with Sketch.The 15 best films of 2018 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Since Cuarón is heavily favoured to win in this category, any other nominee for Best Director will essentially earn the honour of losing to him. Cooper will almost certainly make an appearance, alongside Spike Lee for BlacKkKlansman and Adam McKay for Vice. While The Favourite has fared well this awards season, its director Yorgos Lanthimos didn’t receive nominations at either the Golden Globes or the Directors Guild Awards, and there\u0027s certainly a feeling\u0026nbspthat voters view the film as belonging more to its stars than its director.Although the expanded list of nominations for Best Picture almost guarantees Black Panther a spot, the real test of its awards appeal will be here. The odds aren’t particularly in Ryan Coogler’s favour, since he lost out both at the Golden Globes and the Directors Guild Awards, but we could be in for a surprise. Last year’s debacle, when\u0026nbspthe Academy introduced a Popular Film category and then swiftly recalled it, may have left a lasting impression in voters’s minds, meaning 2019 could see a definitive statement made that the Academy is eager to embrace the quality blockbuster.This category may turn out to be the most hotly contested of the night. Glenn Close, Lady Gaga, and Olivia Colman have all been picking up trophies for the respective performances in The Wife, A Star is Born, and The Favourite. The Critics Choice Awards even struggled to even narrow it down to one person, sharing the awards between both Gaga and Close. Melissa McCarthy is also very likely to see a nomination here for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, while the last slot will be a contest between Emily Blunt for Mary Poppins Returns and Nicole Kidman for Destroyer.The frustrating truth of awards season is, of course, that anyone who isn’t already an established name or a massively publicised Hollywood breakout rarely gets a look-in. The result is that one of the year’s most phenomenal performances, Yalitza Aparicio in Roma, will probably end up going without recognition, even when Roma may sweep the awards elsewhere. \u0026nbspThe odds are less clear-cut when it comes to Best Actor, and there’s a chance the winner here may be partially determined by the mood of the rest of the awards race. Vice’s Christian Bale, Bohemian Rhapsody’s Rami Malek, and A Star is Born’s Bradley Cooper form a trio of strong contenders.However, their chances could depend on how favourably the Academy looks on their respective films. If A\u0026nbspStar is Born really ends up being Roma’s biggest competition, Cooper’s chances could go up. If Bohemian Rhapsody is snubbed in other categories, Malek’s chances could go down.\u0026nbspGreen Book’s Viggo Mortensen is also an easy bet here.The last spot, however, could be a little more unpredictable. BlacKkKlansman’s John David Washington is the safer choice, but there’s a question of whether First Reformed’s Ethan Hawke will make a surprise appearance here. The film, at large, hasn’t fared particularly well this awards season, despite the massive critical acclaim it received on release there’s a good chance its indie credentials (it was distributed by A24) have meant the film has been overlooked by voters.Anyone who’s seen The Favourite will be surprised to see Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone both pitched here as supporting roles, since the film is quite obviously a three-hander. Call it another case of “category fraud”: studios have increasingly treated the split between lead and supporting as a strategic game, and there’s a clear hope here that The Favourite will end up with wins in two acting categories as opposed to one. However, Stone and Weisz will face stiff competition from If Beale Street Could Talk’s Regina King, with Vice’s Amy Adams and First Man’s Claire Foy also expected to receive nominations.Thomasin McKenzie should be somewhere on this list, since her performance in Leave No Trace has been praised across the board. Yet, like\u0026nbspAparicio, McKenzie suffers a combination of not being a recognisable name, not having had a major publicity push, and appearing in a fairly low-budget independent production.Mahershala Ali’s Golden Globe win for Green Book has secured him as the favourite in this category, but there’s some competition still from both BlacKkKlansman’s Adam Driver and Can You Ever Forgive Me?’s Richard E Grant. Sam Rockwell is expected to appear for Vice, although his work has been overshadowed by Bale’s formidable Dick Cheney impression. Timothée Chalamet, meanwhile, will likely continue his Hollywood ascendency and land a nomination for Beautiful Boy.However, one of the strangest exclusions from this year’s awards race is Sam Elliott for A Star is Born. The actor was an early favourite to win, but has dropped off the radar in recent months without much rhyme or reason, perhaps overshadowed in the film’s publicity campaign by the central pairing of Gaga and Cooper.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is why a stodgy literary biopic like The Life of Emile Zola somehow won the main award at the 1937 Oscars. It’s a solid and worthy piece of work, with a grandstanding performance from Paul Muni (under a lot of whiskers) as the campaigning French novelist. The idea, though, that it is one of the “few truly great pictures of all time”, as its own publicity suggested, is clearly idiotic.It may seem churlish to go after an underdog like Rocky but this was an undeserving Best Picture winner. The Academy voters in 1976 acted as if they were punch drunk and had spent too long in the ring with Apollo Creed. The problem with its victory wasn’t so much the film itself but with the other nominees that were spurned in its favour. Taxi Driver, All the President’s Men and Network all surely had a better claim to that year’s statuette.310 8. Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.110 10.

Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.Catch up with all the action has it happened in our live blog below – and scan your eyes over the full list of nominations here.Well, it\u0027s been an honour bringing these updates to you.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her.

With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father.

The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years.

His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop.

The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with.

All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future.

So it’s something of a miracle that The Favourite has received no less than 10 nominations, including nods for Best Picture, Best Director, Supporting Actress (times two) and Lead Actress. And it looks likely that Olivia Colman, at least, will take home a golden statue for her starring role as Queen Anne.\u0026nbspAlexandra PollardCreated with Sketch.

The Best Years of our LivesWilliam Wyler’s film about three veterans coming home at the end of the war still has a huge emotional kick. They’re from different classes and backgrounds but struggle terribly to readjust to civilian life. Some accuse the film of being pious and self-righteous but it deals frankly and very movingly with both the soldiers’ problems and those of their families and friends in understanding them. It won its best picture Oscar in the year in which It’s a Wonderful Life was also nominated.310 8. An American in ParisThe best MGM musicals showed extraordinary artistry. This is one of the greatest. It’s not just the choreography or Gene Kelly’s wildly energetic performance as the aspiring artist in postwar Paris but the use of colour and sound. The ballet sequence at the end of the film stands alongside that in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s The Red Shoes as a perfect example of filmmaking in which every element balances perfectly.Producer Hal Wallis at Warner Bros had a knack for overseeing films that were both mainstream and had a social conscience. Not only did Casablanca have Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, but it also dealt with refugees, betrayal and wartime politics. The script by Julius and Philip G Epstein provided lines of dialogue about gin joints, rounding up the usual suspects and playing “As Time Goes By” that are still quoted today. Few other best picture winners are as engrained in the public consciousness as Casablanca.510 6. On the WaterfrontElia Kazan’s On the Waterfront can be read as the director’s attempt at justifying his own craven behaviour, naming names in front of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities, during the communist witch hunts. Its politics are complicated and contradictory. It is also magnificently acted. Marlon Brando gives arguably his greatest performance of all as Terry Molloy, the dockworker and pigeon fancier who could have been a contender in life and in the boxing ring if only his brother had stood by him when he needed him most.610 5. Lawrence of ArabiaEasy to dismiss as a jingoistic widescreen epic, David Lean’s film about TE Lawrence makes astonishing viewing seen in 70mm. It also offers a probing and subtle portrayal of Lawrence (Peter O’Toole), the masochist who is both the quintessential English hero and the quintessential English outsider.Joseph L Mankiewicz’s drama about a young actress on the make and the established star whose career she wants to usurp boasts some of the most caustic dialogue in any Hollywood best picture winner. The brilliance of Bette Davis as the star and of Anne Baxter as the seemingly ingenuous but utterly ruthless young pretender is matched by George Sanders’ wonderfully acidic performance as the theatre critic, Addison DeWitt.Still the greatest sequel in Hollywood history, this film emulated its predecessor The Godfather, in winning the best picture Oscar and out-stripped it in the brilliance of its craftsmanship and performances. Everything here, from Gordon Willis’s cinematography to the parallel stories of Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone as the crime family boss in the late Fifties and Robert De Niro as his father Vito many years before, works near perfectly. The rival Best Picture nominees in 1974 included Lenny, Chinatown and The Conversation (also directed by Francis Ford Coppola). All would have been worthy winners in other years.The western was considered an anachronism and so was Clint Eastwood himself when Eastwood made his blood soaked masterpiece. Eastwood played Will Munny, first encountered as a farmer and family man. Gradually, we learn about his past as a gunman.  “I\u0027ve killed women and children. I\u0027ve killed just about everything that walks or crawled at one time or another, and I\u0027m here to kill you, Little Bill,” he tells old rival Gene Hackman.

Academy voters are sometimes accused of self-righteousness and prudery, but thankfully that didn’t stop them giving the best picture Oscar to The Apartment.It’s the perennial embarrassment of awards season. Outside of the rare exception, including Greta Gerwig’s nomination for Lady Bird last year, female directors almost never get a look-in when it comes to the main the categories. This year is no different. The Best Director category featured all-male nominees, with the Best Picture category also failing to nominate a single film directed by a woman, despite the expanded list of eight different films. It feels particularly egregious this year, when there were several high-profile and critically acclaimed works directed by women that seem primed for awards season, including Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace. To see Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me? nominated in several other categories, including Best Adapted Screenplay, makes the exclusion even more glaring.Furthermore, the Academy also failed to nominate a single female cinematographer, editor, or composer. Although these exclusions also reflect that fact women in the industry are rarely granted the kind of high-profile jobs that land you an Oscar nomination, the Academy also has the responsibility to help elevate this female talent, even if their work is lesser-known, so as to put them in the spotlight, get them further work, and finally help break this cycle.\u0026nbspClarisse LoughreyBlack Panther is the first superhero film nominated for Best PictureBlack Panther, Ryan Cooler’s fearless, exhilarating Marvel Comics adaptation, has become the first ever superhero movie to be nominated for Best Picture. In the past, films such as this have been confined mainly to the Sound and Visual Effects categories even Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed Batman trilogy never managed a Best Picture nod. If anything deserved to break that pattern, though, it was Black Panther. Wakanda Forever.\u0026nbspAlexandra PollardJames Bulger’s mother ‘disgusted’ at Oscar nod for film about son Oscar nominations 2019 list in fullOlivia Colman among British actors nominated for OscarsSam Elliott, Marina de Tavira and Yalitza Aparicio score surprise acting nods – but Timothée Chalamet gets snubbedSam Elliott landed a nomination in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role category for his role as Bobby Maine, Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper)’s manager and half-brother in A Star is Born. This is Elliott’s first Academy Award nomination, and the most high-profile accolade he has earned for the part so far. Marina de Tavira, meanwhile, is nominated in the Actress in a Supporting Role category for her performance as mother Sofia in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, which propelled her to mainstream acclaim. Yalitza Aparicio – who had never acted before she auditioned for Roma – also scored a nomination in the Actress in a Leading Role category, for her role as Cleodegaria “Cleo” Gutiérrez.Notably, Timothée Chalamet’s performance as drug addict Nicholas “Nic” Sheff in Beautiful Boy failed to earn him a nod, despite being overall praised by critics. The film itself isn’t part of this year’s crop of nominees, in what has already been decried as a major snub.\u0026nbspClémence Michallon\u0026nbspForeign language films break out of their categoryOne of the most refreshing things about this year’s nominations is seeing films not in the English language actually represented outside of one single category. It’s a positive move in breaking down the concept that filmmaking is an entirely Hollywood-centric production (with a few UK productions thrown into the mix), hopefully meaning that, in the future, we’ll see the traditional notions of an Oscar-worthy film break down and a greater ersity of cinema actually rewarded. Roma has tied with The Favourite, an English language production, albeit by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, for the most awards with 10 nominations. What’s particularly surprising is to see two performances from the film, Marina de Tavira and Yalitza Aparicio, nominated in the acting categories, especially because it puts Roma in a strong position to win. If it does, it would be the first film not in the English language to win Best Picture. Furthermore, Cold War, by Polish director Paweł Pawlikowski, was also nominated in several categories, including (crucially) Best Director and Best Cinematography.\u0026nbspClarisse LoughreyThe Brits continue to dominate“We want the finest wines available to humanity. And we want them here, and we want them now!”It’s 31 years since the Academy overlooked Richard E Grant’s indelible performance as a hard-drinking thesp in Withnail and\u0026nbspI, that endlessly quotable – and sad – ode to British nihilism. So it’s wonderful news that’s he’s finally been nominated for an Oscar, for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, a comedy-drama in which he dials the exuberance up at every turn. Fellow Brits Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz are both nominated, as expected, for The Favourite, while Christian Bale is up for best actor for his portrayal of Dick Cheney – a role for which he said he was inspired by “satan”.\u0026nbspPatrick SmithPeter Farrelly’s comedy-drama may have scored five nominations, including two acting nods for Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali (in the Actor in a Leading Role and Actor in a Supporting Role categories respectively), but it failed to land a nod in the Directing category – a notable setback in the film’s successful award season thus far. In addition to the two acting nods, Green Book is nominated in the Film Editing and Writing (Original Screenplay) categories, as well as Best Picture – meaning it could still end up being the talk of the night.\u0026nbspClémence MichallonThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No such object has ever been discovered, but it has been hypothesised because of the unusual way objects we can see are moving around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut now a new paper suggests an entirely different explanation: there is a disc made up of small icy bodies that put together is as much as ten times as massive as the Earth.That explanation appears to account for the unusual orbits that can be seen in some objects in the distant solar system, the researchers claim.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But the search is complicated by the fact that it is harder to see the properties of our own solar system, compared with those that we are looking at from the outside.When observing other systems, we often study the disc surrounding the host star to infer the properties of any planets in orbit around it, said Sefilian.The problem is when you\u0027re observing the disc from inside the system, it\u0027s almost impossible to see the whole thing at once. While we don\u0027t have direct observational evidence for the disc, neither do we have it for Planet Nine, which is why we\u0027re investigating other possibilities. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that observations of Kuiper belt analogues around other stars, as well as planet formation models, reveal massive remnant populations of debris.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tory supporters of a Final Say vote are not expected\u0026nbspto support it because they believe\u0026nbspthe Labour motion would complicate matters. They will instead throw their weight behind amendments explicitly designed to lead to another referendum.Even if Labour\u0027s motion passes, it would merely lead to a Commons vote on whether or not to hold\u0026nbspanother public vote. Labour says it would not necessarily order its MPs to back another referendum in such a vote.The\u0026nbspchair of the Commons Brexit committee has tabled a motion asking the government to give MPs a series of indicative votes on the various options for leaving the EU. These are designed to show which plan would be most likely to command a Commons majority.\u0026nbspThe outcomes to be voted on would be those laid out by Mr Benn\u0027s committee in a recent report. They are: another vote on Ms May\u0027s deal\u0026nbspleaving the EU without an agreement on 29 March\u0026nbsprenegotiating the Brexit deal to either make changes to the backstop arrangements, pivot to a Canada-style free trade deal or pursue a softer Brexit via a Norway-style agreement or calling\u0026nbspanother referendum.The idea of holding indicative votes has\u0026nbspbeen backed by several cabinet ministers, including Damian Hinds, the education secretary, Greg Clark, the business secretary and Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThe aim of Ms Cooper\u0027s amendment is very clear: it is designed to stop the UK leaving the EU in March without a deal. The motion tabled by the Commons home affairs committee chair would take away the government\u0027s power to determine the Commons agenda and\u0026nbspwould instead prioritise a debate on her\u0026nbspEuropean Withdrawal No. 3 Bill.\u0026nbspThis bill says that, if no Brexit deal has been agreed by\u0026nbspparliament by 26 February, Ms May must hold a Commons vote on a motion instructing her to delay\u0026nbspBrexit until the end of the year.\u0026nbspIf the vote is passed, she would have to ask the EU to extend Article 50 until 31 December 2019.The plan is the latest version of a proposal devised by a cross-party group of MPs. An earlier version would have handed control of Brexit to the powerful Commons Liasion Committee if the government was unable to secure support for its deal. That was dropped after members of the committee, which is made up of the chairs of all the other Commons committees, voiced concerns.\u0026nbspThe latest amendment is backed by senior parliamentarians from across the Commons and is expected\u0026nbspto secure Labour\u0027s support, meaning it is likely to pass.The main motion being backed by supporters of another Brexit referendum, this\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbsptabled by\u0026nbspformer attorney general Dominic Grieve would\u0026nbspfreeze the centuries-old rule that says the government has the power to decide what MPs debate.Instead, it would allow time for\u0026nbspsix\u0026nbspdebates on Brexit, to take place on 12 February, 26 February, 5 March, 12 March, 19 March and 26 March. These would be on a motion simply saying that the Commons has considered the United Kingdom’s departure from, and future relationship with, the European Union”.Crucially, these motions\u0026nbspwould be amendable, giving MPs the chance to table amendments\u0026nbspproposing a range of outcomes. Mr Grieve is likely to use the opportunity to pursue\u0026nbspa fresh referendum, and has already tabled parliamentary bills that would trigger another public vote.No-deal Brexit to hurt economy of every UK region, CBI predictsMPs and business leaders protest at identical Brexit ‘plan B’40 ministers could resign over no-deal Brexit vote, May warnedAirline meals being stockpiled as travel industry braces for BrexitOther MPs are likely to table amendments calling for a range of outcomes, ranging from a softer Brexit to a no-deal withdrawal. These\u0026nbspwould then be voted on by the Commons. In\u0026nbspthis sense, the\u0026nbspamendment would trigger indicative votes similar to the motion tabled by Mr Benn.Unlike Mr Benn\u0027s plan, however, Mr Grieve\u0027s would ensure\u0026nbspthat the series of votes takes place, rather than simply asking the government to hold them.\u0026nbspIt also leaves open the number of different outcomes that could be voted on, whereas Mr Benn wants only four to be considered.Mr Grieve\u0027s motion has been backed by other supporters of a fresh referendum from the Conservatives, Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whether they actually do the trick technically, and what the constitutional implications are for the future, I think needs some hard thought.”\u0026nbspSpeaking his amendment on Sky News, the ex-cabinet minister, Dominic Grieve, said: What my amendment does is to identify a number of Tuesdays between now and the date of Brexit in which the business will be controlled by the House itself and not by the Government.There will be a motion in neutral terms to start the day which is about looking at Brexit and what is going on, then members of parliament can table amendments for consideration which can be turned into resolutions of the House.He added: A resolution of the House is a pretty solemn thing.If the House says that it thinks something ought to be done which the government isn\u0027t doing, the government can decide to ignore it but historically it would be very unusual in our constitution for that to happen.\u0026nbspDominic Grieve\u0027s amendment contains a provision for MPs to take control of Parliamentary business a day every fortnight in February and then a day a week in March until Brexit day.The amendment states that on February 12 and 26, and March 5, 12, 19 and 26, the first item of business in the Commons would be a Motion in the name of the Chairman of Ways and Means \u0027That this House has considered the United Kingdom\u0027s departure from, and future relationship with, the European Union\u0027.It also allows for debate of up to six-and-a-half hours and the motion, like that due to be laid on Tuesday, would be amendable.This is from the Press Association on Theresa May\u0027s former chief-of-staff, Nick Timothy.The appointment of one of Theresa May\u0027s former close aides to a prestigious Commonwealth Games role has drawn controversy.Nick Timothy, the Prime Minister\u0027s ex-joint chief of staff, has been made a non-executive director to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games by Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Wright.Mr Timothy left his post with the PM after the Tories lost their majority at the 2017 general election, and is now mostly known as a newspaper columnist.Labour MP Martin Whitfield, who supports the pro-Europe Best for Britain campaign, said: This is a blatant example of \u0027jobs for the boys\u0027.Handing Nick Timothy a plum job like this is clearly a reward for his attacks on Tory Remainers.I\u0027m sure he will deliver the same success to the games that he did for Brexit and the Tories.Mr Timothy, who grew up in Birmingham, will not be remunerated for the Commonwealth Games role.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to load.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of course we stand behind the Good Friday agreement but that is what a no-deal scenario would entail.”Give up UK driving licences to prepare for Brexit, Foreign Office saysBoth the EU and UK could face sanctions under the WTO rulebook if they try not to enforce the border.

This is vital for both the physical and mental wellbeing of parents and babies.I am absolutely committed to making progress on this issue of proxy voting, and I am delighted to be able to confirm to the House today that a substantive motion on proxy leave in the case of maternity, paternity and adoption has been tabled today for the House’s agreement on Monday 28 January.Jo Swinson makes history by taking her baby into Commons debateMPs back efforts to overturn \u002718th Century\u0027 baby leaveTory says pregnant MP delaying birth for Brexit vote \u0027to make a point\u0027Labour MP to delay birth of child to vote against Brexit dealThe trial could begin within days if signed off by party bosses, as\u0026nbspparliament gears up for further clashes on Brexit ahead of exit day on March 29.Labour MP Jess Phillips pledged to\u0026nbspmake a misery of the lives of any MP who objects based on their patriarchal, paternalistic, draconian, old-fashioned sensibilities, amid concerns it will take just one person shouting object to delay the reform.She said a feminist army would confront anyone who challenge the plans, in a veiled threat to\u0026nbspbackbench Tory MPs, such as Sir Christopher Chope, who came under fire for blocking a bill to prevent upskirting by shouting, object.Sir Christopher later defend his decision, saying\u0026nbsphe opposed the bill simply because\u0026nbspit needed further debate.\u0026nbspThe historic moves comes after a long-running campaign from senior MPs to prevent parliament being run like an “18th century gentleman’s club”, amid warnings that female politicians risked being shut out of key votes.Ms Siddiq, who gave birth to her son Raphael last week, said it was a really momentous (and overdue change).Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ms Swinson,\u0026nbspwho tabled the urgent question, welcomed the pilot scheme but said the move was long overdue.She said: I thought things were pretty bad when back in June, in the heatwave, I was 10 days past my due date - but the government\u0027s response to the House\u0027s instruction to introduce proxy voting gives a whole new meaning to the word overdue.It\u0027s shameful that last week (Tulip Siddiq) was put in the invidious position of having to try to make a choice between potential health risks to her baby and whether or not her constituents could have their voice heard on the biggest issue of our time.Nobody should be put in that position.MPs unanimously backed a blueprint for a proxy leave system in February 2018 - created\u0026nbspby the cross-party Procedure Committee -\u0026nbspbut little progress has been made despite several debates.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Forensic officers inspect the remains of the van used as a car bomb on an attack outside Derry Court House in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.

Every potential bomb, even ones suspected of being hoaxes must be treated as a threat.A recent study on the mental health of bomb disposal operators found that up to  per cent of serving and former personnel could be suffering from PTSD.The study was conducted by the Felix-Health Group — Felix is the Army codename for bomb disposal officers.At least  serving and former operators took part in the anonymous survey.The report states that members of the bomb disposal force may be “more susceptible to PTSD because of the repetitive exposure to traumatic situations”, such as the threat from terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.One serving bomb disposal expert said: “We are incredibly busy. Every day there is a team somewhere on a task around the UK.“They might be dealing with a suspected terrorist device or a pipe bomb, which can be lethal, which has been built by a teenager after downloading a bomb making manual from the internet.“We also accompany counter-terrorist police on every operation these days because in many cases they will be targeting a terrorist suspected of making bombs.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That many want to leave without a deal ­boggles their minds and induces fainting and nausea.So it was on Thursday as they all watched TV’s Question Time, that ­traditional safe space for left-wing, Government-bashing Remainerism.The audience in Derby hollered approval at the idea we should simply walk away on March . Thatno deal can be found, then that is at least the Brexit a majority voted for in .One Europhile writer found it “staggering, terrying”. Which, funnily enough, is how voters view a political and media elite so wedded to a comfortable status quo that they are completely disconnected from anyone outside the bubble.The Sun would prefer a deal. We just cannot support the fatal flaws in Theresa May’s. But millions, not just Leavers now, ARE ready to brave No Deal because they know that democracy must deliver what the majority voted for.Andthe Remainer elite are shocked by a few dozen Leavers on TV they had better prepare themselves.If Brexit doesn’t happen,Article  is revoked andBritain is forced to vote again, the roar of rage will deafen them.COMMONS Speakers normally get a ­peerage. We are delighted to learn John Bercow won’t.One senior minister branded him “a biased f***wit” and “repulsive beyond measure”. Not a ringing endorsement.But then a man who tore up centuries of Parliamentary procedure in his ­personal battle against the biggest ­democratic mandate in our history deserves ignominy, not honour.And that’s before you factor in serious bullying allegations against him.It is a shame he won’t also lose his £million State pension pot. But we can’t have everything.Bercow’s only hope, following his bias against the Government, is that Opposition parties put him up for a Lords seat.But that would rather give the game away, wouldn’t it THE staggering achievements of Brampton Manor should inspire every state school.It’s an academy in Newham, London — one of the country’s poorest areas. Yet  sixth-formers this year alone have got Oxbridge offers. Nearly all are ethnic minority kids, most of them the first in their family ever to go to university.There’s no big secret. Just hard graft, long hours and bright, motivated pupils encouraged to believe anything is possible. Plus tireless and dedicated staff.It’s an incredible success story.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What a powerful statement.This school’s success is rooted in a couple of factors. It has a dedicated “study centre” open from am until pm.The centre was opened after the school realised that some of their students who live in busy or chaotic households don’t have access to a quiet study space.Role models are emphasised within the school, which has created a “university access team” featuring five full-time members of staff who are all Oxbridge graduates.Quite apart from the academic challenges — the privilege and elitism surrounding the world of Oxbridge is so intimidating that even the brightest kids coming from ordinary households could easily conclude that they wouldn’t belong.So the university access team also help them to see Oxbridge as an achievable goalThey take students to museums and find other ways to get them excited about study.Their sole aim is to support potential candidates, from  upwards, to get into good universities. I often say you can’t help where you start but you can decide where you end up.And this is a brilliant example.This kind of success comes down largely to self-belief.These children have been encouraged to visualise a very bright future for themselves, and to believe that they are worthy of it. And with that powering you, the sky really is the limit.Which is why the story about a young woman called Liv Conlon, from Bothwell near Glasgow, also caught my eye.Liv set up her first business at , importing goods from China and selling them online.She used the money she made from that to start another company, called The Property Stagers, which furnishes empty homes and, after years of bullying, decided to leave school at  to run it full time.Liv is now . The company furnishes more than  properties a year, and she’s hired a team of ten people – including her mother and brother.She’s also bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat — all without the help from the Bank of Mum and Dad.She believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her set on being a success.“It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that just put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better.”An outstanding attitude and what a role model Liv is.Nothing is more powerful than feeling irrepressible and the desire to cock a snook at the people who don’t want you to achieve.Both these stories prove the same point: If you believe in yourself – and you are prepared to work hard – there is no limit to what you can do.Yes, you need a bit of luck. But in my experience the harder you work, the luckier you get.DJ Sara Cox said this week she has to “work at friendship” as she gets older, words that really resonated for me.When you are young friendships are the backbone of your le and feel effortless.But things change.Andyou aren’t careful you get boring.I’m shocked at how easy it can be to reach a point where you don’t want to go out or do anything in your spare time.But you know what  It’s so important to force yourself off the sofa every so often and have a laugh with your girlfriends. I just need to get Dry January out of the way first.No wonder some envious people have been making mean comments.Meghan has glided through the past few months with real dignity, while also looking a milllion dollars.She is positively glowing. . .  something I never quite managed during pregnancy, despite all the promises.MY heart went out this week to Andy Murray, and the despair he so clearly feels that his body is letting him down and ending his career.It’s a reminder that the toughest part of the job for sports stars is the end. And the higher you’ve flown, the bigger the fall.I had a glimpse of how it feels ten years ago when I sold my business and had a bit of a . . . lull, before the next thing happened.During that time, I’d phone people up and when the receptionist asked me where I was calling from, my answer was, “Um, my living room.”For the first time in my le I wasn’t being defined by my business or my job title.The same will surely be true for Andy when he can no longer say that he is an international tennis player.The dficulty for professional sportspeople on retiring is that, suddenly, everything you have been geared up towards and focusing on is not there any more. There is nothing so harsh as the realisation that you are no longer relevant.I’ve seen this happen to a lot of footballers.One day you are a revered player for a Premier League club where everything is done for you. The next you are on your own, trying to make your way in a not-always-friendly world.In my view, people who cope are those who look forward not back. They look at what is happening in the next chapter, rather than who they once were.Take John McEnroe who is a hugely successful TV pundit and author. He has capitalised on his success – and shared it. And I have a feeling that, when the pain subsides, Andy Murray will do the same.HAS anyone  noticed how many news stories at the moment seem to be about people carrying and using a machete Why on earth would anyone need to carry a machete in England  We don’t live in a jungle, although it might feel like it at times.The only way to stop this epidemic is to pass a law prohibiting the ownership of this type of weapon.Anyone selling them on the internet for dispatch to this country needs to be issued with a UK arrest warrant and prosecuted.NOT quite sure what is motivating everyone to take part in the so-called “Ten-Year Challenge” – where you upload a photo of yourself from ten years ago to social media, together with a recent one, we’ve mocked one up for Adele.The only possible reason to do this, as far as I can see, is to say: “Haven’t I aged well ”I like a challenge . . . but this one’s not for me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The margin was higher than expected because some Labour MPs abstained, highlighting deep unease in the party about its leader’s fitness for high office.In contrast, even after a sobering setback, Theresa May signalled her determination to seek further concessions from Brussels.Mr Corbyn rebuffed the Prime Minister’s offer of talks unless she ruled out leaving with No Deal. If only he took such an uncompromising stance towards terrorists and despots. In reality, Jeremy Corbyn has no idea what Labour’s policy on Brexit would be.The path ahead is set in law. The UK will leave the EU in  days’ time — preferably with a deal,not on World Trade Organisation terms.  If Labour wants to reverse that legislation, it will require government backing — and the PM has made clear she won’t support it.The EU has asked to hear what alternatives the UK would accept. So this is a moment of truth, a test for the EU. Are they serious about a deal The Government must seek two essential changes. First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result. Pushing back the exit date would just prolong the anguish of this tortuous haggle with Brussels.None look capable of ­mustering support from a majority of MPs. I am struck by how many Remain voters — let alone Leavers — now just want to see Brexit done.It’s time for politicians to re-focus on boosting jobs, easing the cost of living and ensuring high-quality schools and NHS services. But the British people won’t move on from Brexit until their ­politicians keep their promises on Brexit.We’ve argued long enough. It’s time for some national self-belief.  People heard the risks and, yes, we need to manage them. But voters also expect their politicians to offer a more optimistic vision of post-Brexit Britain and grasp the opportunities.We will control our laws and our immigration policy. We will continue to trade in Europe, but broaden our global horizons — which is good for creating jobs, boosting wages, and offering UK consumers cheaper goods and wider choice.We should put rocket boosters up the economy by cutting business taxes and raise the threshold of National Insurance employee contributions to save workers more than £ each year.While we’re at it, a more robust pro-competition policy at home would give small businesses the opportunity to break into markets, end consumer rip-offs and offer customers better deals.Enough wrangling.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463397365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sob stories ruined sas who dares wins","story":"A political decision that was clearly designed to distract voters and get an easy round of applause.Two things that were never going to stop Channel  enforcing the same rules at its own brilliant version of selection, SAS: Who Dares Wins, evenit was the last show on television that needed any fixing.Its three series have been close to works of art, in fact, largely thanks to their breathtaking settings and four instructors, Ant Middleton, Jason Fox, Matthew Ollerton and Mark Billingham, who gave it such an air of authenticity you could suspend disbelief and imagine you were watching the real thing.As the show’s introduction would have it, though, everything’s changed and they’re a band of brothers no more.The fourth run has  female recruits including a mole called Petra who’s served, for nine years, with Swedish Special forces, on their “front line”.A place which — full ignorant disclosure — I didn’t think extended much beyond the first day of Ikea’s January sales when it all kicks off on Malmo High Street, but actually involved several tours of Afghanistan.Her job here was to spy on all the contestants, and Petra’s certainly done a better job than the production team, because I’ve been watching it for three weeks and can only name three men.First to show, in Chile, was a Muslim called Qash, who voluntarily withdrew after discovering he’d have to share bathroom facilities with the women .  There’s also been no avoiding mentally fragile Nathaniel, or Milo, who’s so camp he makes Alan Carr sound like Lee Marvin.The rest of the  blokes, though, have just become anonymous blips on the horizon while the camera fixates on the women.Among their favourites have been: Saranya, who became the first candidate ever to shout “WHEEEEEEEEEE!” during the ft abseil, tattooed Tracey, blunt Aberdonian Lou, with the voice that goes through you like a rusty bayonet, and television natural Louise, who was the only woman bold enough to challenge a man in the boxing round, and suffered an uncomfortable beating for her troubles.Standards y, but the brutal, straight-down-the-line approach of the four instructors rarely wavers on screen, no matter the gender or how much noise they make.“You having a baby ”“No staff.”“Then shut the f*** up.”This is why you’d probably trust Ant Middleton and the other three with your lives.Politicians and TV people, on the other hand, I trust about as far as I could piggy-back them up the Andes.Almost no encouragement is needed, butyou give them any they will try to reduce every show on TV to one long procession of box-ticking contestants with a crowd-pleasing, right-on ­conclusion.That’s why the most over-worked recruit on this series is the pianist on sob story duties.It may always have had an element of this, of course, but the point when the scales really fell from my eyes was Sunday’s voluntary withdrawal of Nathaniel, who left a letter for the other weeping recruits announcing: “This is just the start of my journey.”You wish him well, obviously, but use of the dreaded J-word wasn’t just the moment I could no longer suspend disbelief, it was also the moment I started to think television was turning SAS selection into Bootcamp on The X Factor.Andthat’s the case, Channel  can have my badge. I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals. Gentlemen, it transpires, no longer prefer blondes.They can’t  stand them, in fact.QUIZ show doughballs of the week.

Holly Willoughby: “Love against the odds is the subject of the phone-in today. Vanessa Feltz, what kind of calls are you hoping for today ”“We’re looking for calls from people who think their love is against the odds.”And that’s why it’s about to win a National Television Award for the ninth year in a row. ANOTHER week brings another incompatible pair of reality TV gimps, with an E title that also sounds suspiciously like their viewing figures.Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, about Matthews and Williams of that ilk, which is based  on the classic misapprehension of every first-time parent: The world is simply full of people who give the slightest toss about their newborn.It’s not. Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV. BBC’s Revolution In Ruins: The Hugo Chavez Story detailing exactly how socialism, with Jeremy Corbyn’s connivance, destroyed Venezuela, the most oil-rich country in South America.Sky Atlantic repeating series one of The Sopranos.

Doctors have warned him to expect concussion.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He could hurt me. I find his behaviour intimidating and worrying.As I am a singer, I am worried he could turn up as I’m working, which is what has happened on previous occasions.”Hall, a former accounts student, pleaded guilty to assault by beating and stalking Miss Crowe when he appeared at Manchester magistrates court.He appeared emotionless as he was handed a -week prison sentence suspended for  months.Prosecuting, Carl Gaffney said: “The aggrieved Miss Rachel Crowe and the defendant were in a relationship for  months.She describes an escalation regarding his behaviour towards her, and she used words such as ‘jealous’, ‘bullying’ and ‘aggressive’ to describe his behaviour towards her.“His behaviour towards her showed that he talked about their physical tendencies. There were a number of incidents also.The court heard Hall had previously appeared before magistrates in Cumbria last November for criminal damage after he had a bust up with Miss Crowe during a wedding.Halls lawyer Nick Ross said: “He recognises this is over and it’s sensible for this to be over.“His behaviour was very persistent, but only over a few days.It was not his place or position to place his arm out to restrain her, it was a little more persistent on the arm of the complainant.Sentencing Deputy District Judge Thomas Moran said: “You have clearly got a problem with relationships and you have come close to receiving a prison sentence judging by the way you pursued your former partner who is clearly terried of you.“I order for there to be no compensation offered - that is the last thing she is interested in.What she wants you to do is leave her alone,you don’t you will find yourself back here and going to prison.”Hall was also made subject of a restraining order for five years, which prohibits him from making any contact with Miss Crowe or attending her address.He must also complete a two year community order, pay £ costs and engage in a Building Better Relationships programme.Miss Crowe had wowed the audience with a rendition of Jenner Rush’s The Power Of Love on the BBC show, after being duped into going to London to visit the fictitious Museum of Humanity.She was surprised by McIntyre when he jumped out of an Egyptian coffin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463291487.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brit travellers new zealand airport deported","story":"At least four of the -strong party of Brits are thought to be flying out of Auckland International Airport today  -

I was weak all the time - I thought I was going to die.C-df is a nasty bug that can cause fatal diarrhoea and bowel inflammation.The bacteria can spread super quickly, especially in places like hospitals. Once you have it, youre susceptible to even more serious infections like sepsis.Antibiotics may lead to infections, although doctors do still prescribe them to stop bacterial growth in the intestines.When no standard medications seemed to work, Douglas doctors suggested an alternative form of treatment: a faecal transplant.Douglas says that he was keen to try the procedure as soon as he heard about it.I said: Nope, I dont need to think about it. When  How soon  Lets do it now, he explained.Within a week, he says that he felt better and within  days, the infection was gone.I couldnt believe it and I tell my friends about it, and theyre like: Youre talking about this And I say: It saved my le, yes, Ill tell anyone and everyone about it, I dont care.Reports from clinical trials have suggested success rates of up to  per cent.The idea behind the gross-sounding procedure was to replenish Douglas gut with healthy bacteria, which would then help him to fight off the infection.It involves the transfer of poo from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of another person.That might sound disgusting, but a stool sample contains around , dferent species of bacteria that act as probiotics.For people who have had all their good bacteria wiped out, that means being able to replenish the digestive tract with a load of top-grade bacteria.A donation is made and once doctors test it to make sure its safe, doctors add saline to dissolve it and run it through a coffee filter to get rid of any particles.Within six hours, the transplant is made via an enemaor a pill.Of course, its not without its risks.If the sample isnt thoroughly screened and cleaned properly, the stool could pass on an infection from donor to recipient - which baring in mind that they have no resistance due to their lack of bacteria - could be incredibly serious.It is only used when other treatments, such as long-term antibiotics, have failed.How is it performed The treatment should only ever be performed by a qualied doctor.It involves collecting a stool sample from a donor, who is tested to ensure they carry no harmful bugs and have the correct bacteria in their digestive tracts to help combat the bug.The sample is then mixed with saline, strained and placed into the patient via a colonoscopy, endoscopy or an enema.How does it work FMT aims to replace good bacteria that has been killed or suppressed, often by the use of antibiotics.This killing of good bacteria allows bad bacteria, specically C.df, to over-populate the colon.The infection can then lead to a condition called C.df colitis, which causes painful and sometimes fatal diarrhoea.By restoring the balance of bacteria in the intestines, the idea is that the patient will be better able to fight infection.Who can be a donor Donors can be family members, or others who are known to you.But, they must:Donors are screened for a range of infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis A, B and C and syphilis.Source: Guy’s and St Thomas’ HospitalFaecal transplants are becoming an increasingly popular way to deal with nasty diarrhoea infections because they seem to be so successful.Scientists now believe that things like Alzheimers, MS, asthma, heart disease and some cancers are also linked to our gut health - which could see faecal transplants being used to prevent at-risk people from developing these conditions.The last two decades have seen a growing list of medical conditions associated with changes in the microbiome -- bacteria, viruses and fungi, especially in the gut, says senior author Dr Justin OSullivan of the University of Auckland.In fact, we know already that changes to the gut microbiome can contribute to disease, based on studies in germ-free mice as well as clinical improvement in human patients following restoration of the gut microbiome by transplanting stool from a healthy donor.But while diarrheal conditions might carry a  per cent success rate, transplants for things like type  diabetes and IBD are much lower - around  per cent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463478629.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mechanic floating screw driver trick","story":"Damian Collins, , from Oldham, Gtr Manchester, spent an afternoon attempting the party piece with an air compressor after watching videos online.In the video, Damian aims the air compressor at the screwdriver handle, which asby magic spins and floats in the air without anything holding it up.But hes warned others dont try this at home after admitting it could end badly.Damian said: Everyones gone absolutely mad trying to work out how I do it.Im using an air blower that blows air at the screwdriver.We use it in the workshop to blow oil or dirt away from the engine when were repairing it.The key to this trick is getting the angle of the screwdriver just right.Youve got to get a spin on the screwdriver so it floats.Its on the perfect angle.When he first saw a video of the trick he believed it was a clever illusion before trying it out himself.He said: I saw a video of it years ago and thought there was a piece of string when I first saw it -

What you did with the money had made Miss Bennetts latter years utterly miserable.You still deny it even telling the probation officer that your great aunt framed you.This case is particularly sad.You have broken hearts and ided a family and my sincere hope is that you will take time in custody to finally stop blaming others."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gettyimages-599373646.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tories put on election footing in case theresa mays brexit deal is defeated again","story":"Sir Mick Davis, the chief executive of the party, briefed officials yesterday, Thereported.But MPs fear that the party isnt anywhere near ready for another poll -

It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure.

Krista Magica, of Sevenoaks, Kent, has dedicated two hours every morning for the last two years creating her signature Lolita doll-like look - with bubblegum pink hair, porcelain white skin and enlarged eyes. The -year-old even wears pixie ears and three sets of  eyelashes to complete the outfit. Her pink-heavy wardrobe features fashion choices from flouncy Victorian-style dresses and Japanese anime-inspired outfits to big  shoes and sparkly crowns.  Krista uses foundation to create a porcelain skin effect and cleverly makes her eyes look huge with eye shadow, white eyeliner, three sets of  eyelashes and coloured contact lenses. The fashion and jewellery designer, who describes herself as a cute magical monster doll from space, also dyes her naturally brown hair pink but mostly relies on wigs as the colour fades fast. Having previously struggled with her mental health, Krista credits her living doll look for her renewed confidence and has even met her boyfriend thanks to it. Krista said: “It takes me around two hours to get ready everyday. It’s pretty long but it’s quite therapeutic to just sit there and do my makeup. “I have always wanted to stand out and as soon as I got into the living doll look, I realised how happy this fashion makes people. “When I go out people like to take pictures of me. A lot of older ladies askthey can take pictures of me to show their grandchildren. It’s really interesting. I don’t get any bad comments.  “On social media people seem to look up to me. I have a lot of people who tell me they’ve been inspired by me. It’s so sweet. It’s really amazing. “And it makes me happy to surround myself with cute things. It’s made me so much more confident. It’s so nice. “It makes me smile and it makes other people smile so I don’t think it’s ever going to stop. “I have always been obsessed with anime and Japanese fashion. “When I was younger I was an emo goth so when I started getting into Japanese fashion I was like ‘wow this is so dferent and so colourful’. It was the complete opposite of what I was.  “When I was , I dyed my hair pink and I was like ‘this is cute, it’s staying’. It went from there and I started overhauling my wardrobe as much as I could. “I have always loved the doll look so I started buying Lolita dresses which are big fluffy Victorian-style dresses in pastel colours. “With Lolita fashion you need to wear petticoats and this giant dress so eventually I started to look for something more practical for when I’m just going to the shop. “Doing the doll makeup was a big learning curve. Over the years my eyes have got bigger and bigger using lashes and lenses. It’s just escalated. “My hair is still pink but I have five wigs because you get a more even colour and can do more with them. There are still times when I might feel to anxious and I dont want to leave the house but getting ready and doing my makeup is so therapeutic it helps. Honestly, I think when I first got into the doll look, I was looking for comfort. Its very comforting being surrounded by cute things. It has made me so much happier. And this look hasnt just given my confidence, theres so much in my le I wouldnt have without it.  Overhauling her look from a goth teen wearing black clothes, dark makeup and black leather boots was a daunting task for Krista with some anime-inspired outfits costing pound. But in a bid to cut down on the costs, Krista avoids high-end makeup brands and has taught herself how to make her own clothes and accessories. The teen has learnt so much she has been able to launch her own clothing and jewellery brand called Planet Magica which she sells through her Etsy shop. Krista said: “When I first got into doll fashion, I was working at a pub and I didn’t have much money. “Overhauling your wardrobe is a big task and a lot of Japanese fashion can be really expensive. Just one PVC outfit can cost pound. “I think I’ve probably spent around pound, a year but I make so much myself. I had to teach myself how to make clothes and accessories. At first when people would message me asking where I got something or how I achieved my look I would feel like a fraud. You hear about people in the community spending thousands and thousands and Im here wearing three sets of Poundland  eyelashes. “But now I’m so proud that my passion for fashion has lead to me starting my own brand and I have grown enough of a following to be self-employed. “It’s not a huge following but it’s tight-knit and they’re so supportive. As soon as I launched I was immediately getting sales.” As well as boosting her self-esteem and inspiring her business, Krista’s transformation has shown her who her true friends are after many decided they no longer wanted to be seen with her. Her doll look also lead her to love as she met her boyfriend Harry Valentine, , through the alternative nightclub scene.  Krista said: “When I started wearing this otherworldly doll fashion, the friends I had then flat-out refused to go anywhere with me. They didn’t like that people were staring. “I understand now that a lot of people don’t want that. They don’t want anybody to even notice that they’re there. “But putting myself out there has helped me so much with my confidence. And it’s how I met my boyfriend.“He wrote to me on Facebook because he thought I was somebody he’d seen at an alternative club. I’d never been to any of the clubs at that point.“Meeting him was like my gateway to the alternative world and now I’ve got all these absolutely colourful friends and we go to the clubs together. “When we’re all out people ask ‘where are you going  Where’s the fancy dress party ’ It’s great.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit labour not suddenly swung","story":"NewsBrexit: Why Labour has NOT suddenly swung behind a second referendumLabour has spelt out more detail of its plan for Brexit - including a vote on a second referendum.

It was hailed by backers of a second EU referendum, who called it a big step forward and grabbing the Brexit bull by the horns. Anti-Peoples Vote MPs then hit back warning they wont support going back to the public. One newspaper called it Corbyn backs plan for second referendum. But amid all the sound and fury, what Labour has suggested isnt actually as dramatic as you might think. Heres a quick explanation of Jeremy Corbyns amendment, what it will do - and what it wont do.  Labour has unveiled an amendment to Theresa Mays Brexit plan ahead of a string of showdown votes by MPs next Tuesday night. If MPs pass it, the Prime Minister would be forced to give MPs a vote on options to prevent a No Deal Brexit on March . Those options would have to include:Negotiating changes to the Brexit deal to secure Labours demands - a permanent customs union with the EU, a strong relationship with the single market and dynamic alignment on workers rights. A second referendum, but only on a deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons.Why are people excited about it   Since September, Labour has been sitting on the fence about exactly how it should solve Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn has kept a second referendum as one option on the table, which apes a motion activists passed at the party conference. Activists are now demanding he swing % behind a second EU referendum after his bid to force a general election didnt succeed. So this new motion, promising a vote down the line on holding a second referendum, has caused lots of excitement. What do second referendum supporters say   Labour MP David Lammy of the anti-Brexit Peoples Vote campaign said: It is a big step forward that for the first time my party is acknowledging in a parliamentary amendment that a People’s Vote may be the only way forward. At the same time, the leadership is saying that Labour’s own Brexit plan should now take centre stage as this crisis unfolds.It is right that any proposal for Brexit deserves to be properly scrutinised. It is only when MPs have had the chance to look properly at these proposals, along with Norway Plus and a catastrophic no deal departure from the EU that they will really be able to decide whether they meet the promises made for Brexit in  and are at least as good as the deal we already have inside Europe. TSSA General Secretary Manuel Cortes said: This is an exemplary and timely amendment with Labour now grabbing the Brexit bull by its horns as May continues to pander to the far right in her party and outside it.“By all means, Labour must now push the government to negotiate a damage limiting Brexit and it is right that our Party now insist that the British people have sign off on any deal.Of course, not agreeing to the deal and staying as we are must be an option when the people do get that final say. But what do allies of Jeremy Corbyn say   Labour suggest the amendment is simply being faithful to the partys conference motion. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said it does not in any way mean the party is backing a second referendum - yet. Instead she told the BBC: The amendment is very specically-worded to allow for the debate of the options. It is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any way. And indeedit was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specic issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time. We are prioritising seeking a deal which provides many of the assurances we have sought from the PM. Plus - the amendment may well not pass  Leading Tory Remainers, such as Anna Soubry, have suggested they wont back Labours Plan B amendment. Without the support of a good number of Tory rebels, the amendment is unlikely to pass through Parliament. If thats the case, the MPs vote on a second referendum wouldnt happen. And a Peoples Vote might not have a majority... Under Labours plan a Peoples Vote would need a majority of support in Parliament in order to be held. Supporters of a second referendum concede it might not have a majority in Parliament yet. So has anything changed  Well of course, yes - Labour has laid out more of its plan and the path it wants to tread from here. The promise of a vote on a second EU referendum brings the party a small step closer to backing one, somewhere down the line. Butyou think itll mean a snap EU referendum just yet - you may be a little disappointed. Full text of Labours amendment [This House] “requires ministers to secure sufficient time for the UK Parliament to consider and vote on options to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a ratied Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration, and that those options should include:Negotiating changes to the draft Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration so as to secure a permanent customs union with the EU, a strong relationship with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, and dynamic alignment on rights and standards, in order to command a majority in the House of CommonsLegislating to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons.”.

The invite was issued despite Jeremy Corbyn boycotting phony talks with Mrs May because she has refused to rule out a No Deal Brexit. The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: The PM is due to be seeing a number of union leaders later this week, one of whom is, I believe, Len McCluskey.  I think the PM has said this is going to be a process of engagement with people from across the House of Commons, but also with other interested sectors - she’s obviously speaking with business leaders today - and she’ll be talking with trade union leaders later in the week. That obviously follows on from phone conversations which she’s already had with them.

Ministers were blasted in the House of Commons today after we obtained footage of a  failing a fire test that was meant to last an hour after  minutes. We reported the firm which built Manchesters X shyEastlands block tried to cover up the results and families were not told for weeks. Housing Minister Kit Malthouse said fire service chiefs had assured him residents of the block are safe tonight. But the top Tory admitted hes certainly not an expert himself. Discussing the case during an urgent question in the Commons, Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: Whatever the minister says hes doing, it isnt working. If the government cant fix problems this serious and this urgent, what on earth is it in office for   The Labour MP said: This should be a cause for national shame that over  months after the Grenfell Tower fire, Im having to drag ministers to the House because there are still buildings in this country cloaked in the Grenfell style cladding with residents who dont knowtheir homes are safe. He added: There were  high rise blocks with the same Grenfell style cladding and  are yet to have this removed and replaced. Its shocking that the minister knows every one of these blocks but wont name the landlords and wont tell the residents. Labour MP Emma Dent Coad - who represents the survivors of Grenfell Tower - warned Grenfell two is in the post. She said: People are genuinely afraid in their bed and just saying that the minister is satisfied is not really enough. Nothing has yet changed, the Government is ignoring warnings, our constituents are going to bed afraid, current measures are not working, as one of the Grenfell survivors said, Grenfell two is in the post. How many more must die before the Government takes positive action to keep people safe in their beds  Minister Mr Malthouse slammed Labours antagonistic approach saying the governments response was immediate and wide-ranging. But he admitted he was cajoling firms in the private sector and more assertive measures may be needed. Without specying any inidual firm he said: He is correct that we will get to a point where there are a small number of owners or contractors who put this cladding on buildings where we will need to consider more assertive measures. Those are under active consideration at the moment.  But he said of the block we highlighted in Manchester: I understand that the local fire and rescue service are satisfied that everybody is safe in that building tonight and that temporary measures are in place while the work is done. Obviously there seems to be some complication about getting that work done but nevertheless it is being done. The Tory minister insisted: All the while, in all of this - and he [John Healey] may present himself as an expert but Im certainly not - we are guided by expert opinion. That includes Dame Judith Hackitts review but also the independent expert , advisory group that was constituted in the immediate aftermath of Grenfell. We follow their advice in making sure that we can guarantee peoples safety tonight. Mr Malthouse said the primary focus was interim measures to make buildings immediately safe.  The minister said interim measures were in place on all  high-rise private residential blocks with unsafe ACM cladding. He added: Weve secured commitments from owners of  privately owned buildings.  have either started, completed or have commitments in place to remediate. There remain  private residential buildings where the owners plans are unclear. But SNP MP Alison Thewliss said: It is extremely disturbing to hear the news from the X Eastlands block in Manchester. Not only has the construction firm neglected to pass on the findings of a field test - they also appear to have threatened to withhold payment for the test unless the testing company signed a non disclosure agreement over the results.  We reported that construction firm Forrest went into shyadministration, allegedly without passing the damning test report on to the buildings’ owners.

Now, shes hit out at Summerhill Primary School in Tipton, West Midlands, for lacking cultural awareness over its policy that no child can have a cut shorter than grade two.Ms Sharpe, who herself is a hair stylist, said: The hair policy lacks cultural awareness as a grade two haircut is not fair for Josiah’s type of hair and others from dferent racial backgrounds. When he first started there, I did try a grade two haircut but within three days, it had started to grow out and it looked a total mess. Speaking to BBC radios Sunday Night with Nikki Tapper Show, the furious mum added: I dont understand, a naughty child can get the same punishment as a child thats having a haircut because thats their cultural norm. Josiah said he wishes he wasnt black because the school doesnt like his hair this way. It was really upsetting for me. Josiah was not attending school over the row. Instead, the younger has been doing work from home.A change.org petition demanding a change to the schools policy has smashed its target to achieve , signatures.However, the school stands by its policy, which it says helps children learn more effectively.  Kerry Rochester, executive headteacher at Summerhill, said: Thepolicystates shaved heads or hairstyles that are deemed by theschool to be extreme, are not acceptable’ and hair should be no shorter than number two . Unfortunately, Josiahs hair has been styled in line with whatweunderstand to bethe skin fade style.Hishair is tapered around the back and sides to what is known as zero fade or bald fade. Therefore, the manner in which Josiah’s hair is styled, falls below the grade twoas set out in ourpolicy. The school has tried to workwith the family to fully explain the school rules to date and why the style is deemed to be extreme. Ms Rochester continued: The family has had, in accordance with the school’s complaints policy, opportunities tostatetheir concerns, both inwriting and via a meeting.  Responses have been provided to the family at each stage of the complaints process, and it’s unfortunate the family have taken this approach before the internal processes have been exhausted. The schoolhasno record of any medical conditions the child suffersfrom, on medical forms provided by the parents, however as with other children in our school, when presented with medical information we are more than happy to work with parents to discuss amendments to policy,this isdeemednecessary and appropriate. We take our school policiesand rules extremelyseriously and impress the importanceof bothwithin our schoolcommunity. Unfortunately,the family continue to ignore the school rules thenappropriatesanctionshave to bemade.

Four-year-old Jacob Scrimshaw, who was born prematurely with one arm, is not able to get the prosthetic on the NHS. Although he doesnt let his disability hold him back, he broke his mums heart by telling her over Christmas: I hate being like this, I want to be like everyone . But Gemma Turner, , found the NHS cant provide the prosthetic because Jacobs left arm stops short of the elbow. She claims the family have applied twice for disability allowance, but have been told the youngster is not disabled enough. Now, she says they must take Jacob to America for the right type of prosthetic.  The police officer, from near Halax, West Yorkshire, is crowdfunding for pound,, around pound, of which would cover the cost of the limb. Mum-of-two Gemma, who is four months pregnant, said: Jacob was born eight weeks premature without his left arm. The doctors dont know why and theres no reason for it. He struggles to do everyday things like tie his shoelaces, turn the pages in a book or use an iPad. Unfortunately they dont offer the type of prosthetic Jacob needs in the UK so weve had to look where.   Jacob needs a body-powered arm, which would be strapped around his chest. But limited resources and little research means that type of prosthetic is not available on the NHS. The work will instead have to be done by a company in New York called A Step Ahead Prosthetics. The youngster has specially requested an arm with a green sleeve to look like the Hulk. Gemma added: Hes only started asking about his arm recently since starting primary school. Hes become more aware that hes dferent to everyone .  I didnt think it was bothering him but over Christmas he had a bit of a meltdown. He said I hate being like this and I want to be like everyone , which was heartbreaking. He said he wants an arm and I know we can get him one, so weve began fundraising for him. In an earlier interview with Examiner Live, the mum had claimed: We applied twice for disability allowance but were told Jacob was not disabled enough.  She continued: But having one arm can stop you doing everyday things you wouldnt think of - like being able to turn the pages of a book. Really he needs an iPad to help him with his learning.He is very intelligent and shouldnt be held back. A GoFundMe to raise the money for the youngsters prosthetic has reached pound in three days.

The dad-of-two started claiming ESA after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis in . He has since developed liver disease and type  diabetes which has left him unable to walk very far and regularly in and out of hospital.   His poor health has caused him to miss numerous appointments with the Department for Work and Pensionsand that all-important work capability assessment last July. He said: Im having a really hard time at the moment. I was unexpectedly admitted to theRoyal Stoke University Hospitalafter being beaten up and missed my appointment with the DWP. I was in hospital for four days and while I was there they stopped my benefits. Ive got hospital discharge letters showing where I was at the time, a sick note from the doctor, and even my MP Ruth Smeeth has been in touch with them. But the situation has not changed - and that is ridiculous.   Ive had to live on nothing but food parcels since August and nothing is being done by the authorities to help me. Some friends have lent me some money but now I owe it back to them. I rely on my ESA. Richard says the DWP has told him to appeal against the ruling or move onto Universal Credit. He added: I shouldnt have to go on Universal Credit because I have multiple illnesses. If I hadnt missed that appointment Id still be on ESA. Im living out of my microwave because my cooker is broken and I cant afford another one. I cant even afford to buy toilet paper. My house is a mess. Ive had noChristmas, I could only afford a couple of corned beef sandwiches for my Christmas dinner. When I was receiving ESA I managed to go three years without having a drink. But now Ive started drinking again and my le is going from bad to worse. I just need the money back. The DWP says claimants need to participate in ESA assessments. A DWP spokesman said: “It is important that claimants who wish to continue to receive ESA participate in an assessment to support their claim for benefits. Every effort is made to give sufficient notice that an assessment is due to take place, andthe date is unsuitable people can ask for the appointment to be rescheduled.

The animal was found by Sandra Hilton who took this distressing image before reporting the find to the relevant authorities. The animal was washed up behind the Royal Channel Islands Yacht Club, Jersey with rubbish around its rostrum. Officers from Jersey’s States’ Fisheries and Marine Resources Department were unable to locate it but urge islanders to look out for it as it was tagged. Paul Chambers, who works in the department, said: The dolphin may have drted back out to sea but, with the tides at the moment, it will probably come back in again. It is a female common dolphin and obviously has some injuries to its snout area.   It looks assomething became wrapped around its beak and there are a series of very deep injuries. It could have been a piece of rubbish that got wrapped around its beak or it could have got caught in fishing gear and struggled to get out. It did look emaciated and could have starved to death but I will have to wait for the dolphin to be recovered - I cannot guarantee the cause of death. Mr Chambers said staff from his section had gone down to the beach to pick up the animal yesterday morning but had been unable to locate it. He added: If we manage to get it back in we will look at the layers of fat - it looked quite thin and it did not have any bulk at the top of the shoulders - and we will also have a look at its sides. We work with the Zoological Society of London and we will see what their opinion is.   He also said that the species was not one which was commonly seen close to the islands shores. He added: The common dolphin is more of an offshore species found to the west and north-west in deeper waters but they are occasionally seen in shallow waters. That does bring it into potential contact with trawlers occasionally, but it is impossible to tellthat is how it died. It looks asit has been dead for several days and has drted a few miles.

Prosecuting, Carl Gaffney said: “The aggrieved Miss Rachel Crowe and the defendant were in a relationship for  months. She describes an escalation regarding his behaviour towards her, and she used words such as ‘jealous’, ‘bullying’ and ‘aggressive’ to describe his behaviour towards her. “In October last year they split up. There were two sets of incidents. Firstly, there were hundreds of emails sent to the complainant from a number of dferent addresses which had been found. “Some of them were made out to be humorous in an attempt to be playful, but this was beyond inappropriate. For example, one of the email addresses was “ pleaseRacheldontdothis@gmail ”.“It was a dull echo of what it was like when she could have been with him, it was described. The emails are benign. The emails became far more frequent as he asked to be taken back. “His behaviour towards her showed that he talked about their physical tendencies. There were a number of incidents also. “The aggrieved goes out on January th. She is out with a friend when he appeared in the same bar demanding to speak to her.   “He appears in front of her face. She manages to escape when her group go to a dferent bar. He followed her into the bar but he was refused entry to the establishment. She became successful in hiding. “However, when she leaves to go to her car out the back, he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her to the ground. She managed to get up and get into her car and locked it. “He then started trying to rip her wing mirror off before jumping on the bonnet of her car trying to stop her from leaving. He was taken off the bonnet by assisting people. “On Janaury th the aggrieved was at her home address when the second incident occurred. He was outside her address uninvited and unsolicited. She was woken up by banging on the windows as the defendant attempted to gain entry. “She was concerned about the noise so went to the front of her address and the defendant was there, begging to get in, but she refused. She remained at the front of the address and she phoned the police and texted her mother and told her she needed to come due to him being outside.   “The defendant then moved round to the back of the address and climbed into the rear garden where he continued banging on the rear door shouting at the aggrieved to let him in. “The defendant was there for up to two hours before he left the address. The police did not come in that timescale. After being arrested, he made signicant admissions and there was immediately no hesitation to guilty pleas. He is a man of a certain physical stature. The court heard Hall had previously appeared before magistrates in Cumbria last November for criminal damage after he had a bust up with Miss Crowe during a wedding.   A probation report compiled by an unnamed author said: “He tells me he didn’t pull the victim to the floor at all, though he did acknowledge jumping on the car bonnet when he thought she was going to drive at him. “Regarding the texts and emails, he said he did make contact as described, but said the victim had sometimes responded to his contact and he said this caused him to make further contact. He used her response to his emails as justication for his actions without giving considerable thought for the impact on the victim. “He said this was a turbulent relationship with the victim because of his alcohol misuse, caused by his dficulties sleeping. This was an angry reaction to the breakdown of the relationship. He kept his own thoughts above that of his victims. He would benefit from intervention to address the offending of this nature.” Halls lawyer Nick Ross said: “He recognises this is over and it’s sensible for this to be over. Regarding the conviction for criminal damage, he ‘kicked off’ at a wedding whilst in drink. He caused some damage to some items at the wedding. He found himself homeless after a fall out with his father. “His behaviour was very persistent, but only over a few days. It was not his place or position to place his arm out to restrain her, it was a little more persistent on the arm of the complainant. He did do that and recognised he was overstepping the line. This assault was not a punch or a kick or a slap.”   Hall was also ordered to complete a two year community order, pay pound costs and he was ordered to engage in a Building Better Relationships programme. Sentencing Deputy District Judge Thomas Moran said: “You have clearly got a problem with relationships and you have come close to receiving a prison sentence judging by the way you pursued your former partner who is clearly terried of you. “I order for there to be no compensation offered - that is the last thing she is interested in. What she wants you to do is leave her alone,you don’t you will find yourself back here and going to prison.” Hall was also made subject of a restraining order for five years, which prohibits him from making any contact with Miss Crowe or attending her address.

Douglas, a retired BT maintenance engineer, thought no more about it until this week when a pound parking fine dropped through his letterbox.  The fine, from car parking firm Minster Baywatch, states that he was not authorised to park in the car park - even though he says he never did. The fine claims he entered the car park on Friday January  at .pm and did not leave until .pm. Douglas said: This is extremely frustrating. I dropped Scott off and then took my we up to Almondbury and then we ed to pick him up. I did not stop or even wait as he was outside waiting for me. The exit time they have is for the second time I went in and out and not the first so they are just wrong. I refuse to pay it but I called to discuss it and they will not do that. They said I had to email or write but why should I when they are wrong.  The father of seven saidwas guilty he would happily pay. He spoke to ExaminerLive to raise the issue and warn others who may be caught out by the number plate recognition system. He added: My advice would be do not go to the same place twice in one day. I have heard about all the problems with the Leeds Road retail park one but this is the first I have heard about this one.

Yvonne Mcmullan , says she cant stop crying over the state of her home and is begging the housing association to provide her with a new one. The expectant mum, who already has a two-year-old daughter, is desperate for a new home before she gives birth in four months. But Yvonne says despite this, the housing association have refused her request. Cobalt Housing have however offered to put Yvonne and he daughter up in a hotel for a week while they carry out repairs to the property, reports the Liverpool Echo. They say the case is a legal disrepair and they are following protocol by carrying out repairs with minimal disruption and without loss of expense. But Yvonne said she would rather be moved to a new house after being told she would have totransfer all her furniture from the downstairs bedrooms before work can begin.   The worried mum, who is on benefits, said she cannot afford to put her possessions in storage, has no way of transporting them and no room to move them upstairs. Yvonne said: I want to be moved to another house. They’ve got me on a band E waiting list which is basically nothing, it could take two, maybe more, years to move. Having to move everything in and back out again while pregnant puts me under a lot of stress. I can’t be on my own here. Im constantly crying. Wereon our own and have basically been told weve just got to do it. Theres no one  who can help. Yvonne said she noticed the damp within weeks of moving in, but only managed to get anything done about it after a surveyor visited last November and found thousands of pounds worth of much-needed health and safety repairs. In a letter seen by the Liverpool Echo, a solicitor identied the home as needing repair work including a re-fitting of the kitchen where cupboards and doors have fallen off, and re-plastering in every room downstairs.   Yvonnes mum Lisa, , said: Its not just the disruption and anxiety that its causing, what they are expecting her to do at five months pregnant. Wouldnt it just be so much easier to put her on a transfer so she can get a property and then she can settle before her baby comes, rather than having to come back here where shell have to redecorate and everything  Shes tried her best to make this a home. Its so sad. its her first home. She gives everything for the baby. Shes really tried. She wont be able to redecorate when she moves back in. It saddens me. I know houses dont pop up every day, I do understand that, and there may be people in dferent situations. but Im just so worried for her. We wanted to come forward so Cobalt can take responsibility for the way Yvonnes been treated, and in the hope that maybe another landlord or housing association might reach out and be able to help us.

But imagine, for a moment, that one little thing was dferent. Britain has been plunged into mourning by the death of Prince Philip in an horric car accident. In a tragic echo of Princess Dianas death  years ago, it is thought he was not wearing a seatbelt. The Queens strength and stay of  years was killed after he stopped his Land Rover at a junction and was hit by a second vehicle...Or perhaps: A Greek migrant is being hunted by police after crashing into a car carrying a young mum and baby on their way home from a day at the beach. The identity of the man, considered a menace by local road users, is known to officers. It is thought he is married to a local woman, although it is not clear whether he has a legal right to remain in the UK...Or even: Third-in-line to the throne Prince George escaped unscathed after his mum the Duchess of Cambridges car was in a smash on a death-trap road. The woman driver of the other vehicle, who also had a child in the back seat, was breath-tested at the scene... The fact a -year-old was involved in a collision has been used to demand older people resit their driving tests, have their licenses revoked and or be confined to barracks.But as the RAC has quite reasonably pointed out,you revoked the right to drive of those people most likely to have a smash, it would mean young people had the most to lose.So imagine a younger household name was involved: Road safety campaigners demanded footballer Raheem Sterling be jailed after a car smash with a young mum and baby. The controversial midfielder, , was seen getting behind the wheel again just a day later, and our exclusive pictures PROVE he didnt even wear a seatbelt. Young people are a bloody menace on the roads, said Prince Philip, while unveiling a plaque just a mile from the crash scene...But the problem isnt age. The problem is us, and our attitude to royalty. Had Raheem Sterling broken a womans wrist in a car accident, leaving her to get washed and dressed with help of her teenaged son, facing two months off work and possible surgery to rebreak the bones and a letime of that wrist never being quite right again, she wouldnt expect his girlfriend to send flowers. Anyone in that situation would more likely be spitting tacks at the thoughtless arsehole who caused a painful injury to a complicated joint that will require a year of rehabilitation, and would be demanding the insurance company screw him for every last penny.And theyd never expect a personal apology, on the grounds everyone in an accident knows admitting responsibility is something best left to the lawyers. The victim probably wouldnt say it could all be resolved with a phone call from Raheem askingshe was all right, because shes such a big fan of Man City.  And had Prince Philip been just about anyone , the accident might not have happened.The Royals do not know what traffic is, because they are never stuck in it. There are chauffeurs, advanced driving experts, and motorcycle outriders ensuring that they can whizz up the hard shoulder, shoot through the lights and ignore the right of way. When Philip drove his own London taxi to get around the capital, it was so he could AVOID traffic.When they get to wherever theyre going, the gates are open. Someone salutes. People wave. Everyone keeps clear of the wheels, which, of course, are always clean. You will never see a Royal in a car that has fingermarks in the weeks worth of road splatter around the doors. Youll never see their wing mirror with a ding or the wipers on their last swipe. Prince Andrew has been accused of ramming gates with his car at Windsor, and knocking over a police officer at the gates of Buckingham Palace. Princess Anne has been done for speeding at mph, and when Prince Edward was courting Sophie Rhys Jones her neighbours got used to ing into hedges to avoid being mown down as he whizzed along the country lane leading to her family home.They all do it. If that family lived in a Hackney high-rise, theyd all have an ASBO. Perhapsthey had experiences more like the rest of us, then when he pulled up to a T-junction where the sun was dazzling his vision the Duke of Edinburgh would have stopped until he could see there was no traffic.Someone with no experience of traffic, though, would assume the road was empty and just pull out. Andsomeone that daft and entitled was behind the wheel of what was literally an armoured vehicle - regardless of their age - theyd get nicked by police. If they had been ploughing into other cars on a semi-regular basis throughout their driving career, theyd get taken to court.Andthe police actually LIVED with them and spoke to them EVERY DAY, it would happen in minutes. Royals have always, traditionally, been pretty deadly. When they were around, serfs were more likely to be beaten, maids certain to be ravished, and large public protests far more likely to see their leaders run through with a sword. Wars were inevitable with every marital breakdown or romantic refusal.Removing some of their powers was a great idea, but giving them -wheel drive and several tons of moving metal to fling about the countryside at whim probably wasnt. The problem weve got is that we treat the Royals like a dferent species, and are disgusted when they act like one.We want manners and Britishness but we get rude Prussians, with fat fingers and tin ears. We bow and scrape and curtsey and mutter about why they arent a little more thoughtful, while removing from their lives all things that require deep thought - careers, taxation, a lack of opportunity.As long as we have a Royal Family that is allowed to own the place, they will continue to act like they do. Butwe demanded they had lives more like ours, they wouldnt be Royal any more - thered be nothing special about them, or perhaps more importantly us. Thats why we put up with them we like to think it rubs off.There is a solution, though: remove the gates from their palaces so they cant get out. Theyd still have lots of space to drive around, theres no traffic to bother them, and we all get to live another day."},{"url":null,"title":"spice zombie howls writhes ground","story":"NewsSpice zombie howls and writhes on ground as city centre shoppers stroll byThe video filmed in Market Place, Leicester was uploaded with the caption: \"Dont smoke that s**t\"ShareCommentsByRaja SharmaKelly-Ann Mills:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video spice-zombie-howls-writhes-ground-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man thought to have taken spice was seen howling in a city centre and writhing in pain, as unsurprised shoppers walk by. The unidentied spice zombie is contorted around a pole as he starts a moaning. The noise gradually increases in volume to a howl as his eyes bulge out and his mouth opens wide. He starts doing a backstroke on the pavement, before picking himself up and running off screaming, barging into a woman before crashing heavily into a shop sign.   The events, in Market Place, Leicester, are accompanied by gasps and laughter. The video was posted to a Facebook group page dedicated to videos of users under the influence of drug spice. It was posted yesterday night, at around pm, with the caption: Dont smoke that s**t. The clip begins with the man on the concrete ground, wrapped around a pole outside a pawnbrokers. He groans with increasing volume, grasping the pole tightly and looking up at the sky as a woman from the pawnbrokers holds the door open and looks on extremely concerned.  The man continues to howl and scream even louder as he desperately clutches the pole. Some members of the public choose to ignore him, while some cannot help but look on. At this point, his eyes visibly bulge out from his skill, his mouth widens, and he contorts as though possessed by a demon. His shrieking grows with intensity, with members of the public parroting some of his shrieking back to him.   He also begins writhing more heavily on the ground, as though paddling backwards, and unwraps himself around a pole. Standing up to run away, the man drops what appears to be a black hat, and races off down the street. Before the clip ends he can be seen still screaming, and running into people and obstacles, tripping up repeatedly.

Husband Paoulo Quispilaya, , and his we Kassandra Diaz-Cervo, , both fell in love with Carly Martinez at a party in October . By February of last year, they had entered into a committed three-way relationship after Paoulo and Kassandra, from Los Angeles, Calornia, asked the -year-old poet and songwriter to join their marriage. Kassandra described how she was immediately attracted to Carly, despite never having been in a relationship with a woman before. She said: I fell in love with Carly. Prior to her, I had had chemistry with females two or three times and felt a flirtation but I had never been in a relationship with a woman. Despite the strong attraction, Kassandra did not initially act on her feelings and she became platonic friends with Carly, who had also never been with a woman before.   But when Carly started to also connect with Paoulo things became romantic and she joined the relationship in February . Carly, also of Los Angeles, Calornia, said: I felt an instant attraction to Kassandra and we became friends. I connected with Paolo in December. We had gone out to a nightclub and we just clicked and I realised that something was happening. We were a triad from the very beginning. Kassandra said: I didnt even know polyamory existed. It just happened. We were unsure of what it was.   We tried not pursuing it and suppressing our feelings because we have been taught that theres no such thing as loving two people at once. We researched it and found that there was a community and a word for it: polyamory. We decided to just do it and not be held back by social conditioning. Paoulo admitted that he had hesitations about welcoming another partner into his marriage but decided it was worth the risk. The digital marketer said: I definitely did have reservations. At first I didnt really know what it was.   I was afraid of what I was getting into and I feared that it might break up my marriage and Id be left with no one. But I knew it wasnt going to be a fling. In April , Carly moved into Paoulo and Kassandras home where the throuple sleep in the same bedroom. She explained that it has not been easy entering a marriage as a third partner. She said: It was confusing and scary. It was hard going into a marriage when they had all those years of shared experience. But how I felt about them exceeded all of the fears that I had.   The throuple admit that family members were shocked to learn of the new relationship and many could not accept it. Kassandra said: At first our families were shocked. Some to the point of no longer communicating with us. As time passed, some of them came to accept our relationship but other family members still wont speak to us. But I would never have gone through telling my familyI didnt believe this relationship was worth it. Paoulo added that it can be frustrating when people reduce their polyamorous relationship to sexual logistics. He said: Peoples first thoughts are so often sexual. They dont understand that this is a committed, long-term relationship.   They think we are just having casual threesomes. However the throuple insist that they are in it for the long-term and one day plan on raising children together. Paoulo said: We definitely will raise children together. I love my mom, I love my brother and I love my dad - our hearts are capable of loving more than one person at the same time. Its not for everyone, butyou are meant to be in a polyamorous relationship, things will naturally fall into place. The throuple share their experiences of le as a polyamorous triad on their Youtube channel Trecta Love.

The -year-old, who has vast experience in archaeology, added: I hope to find the tomb of Antony and Cleopatra soon. I do believe that they are buried in the same tomb. We are so close to discover the accurate location of the tomb we are on the right way. We know where exactly we have to dig.

According to popular belief, she and Mark Antony committed suicide in August  BC when she was  by allowing an asp to bite them. But some claim she was in murdered and say discovering her body will help provide evidence to prove it. Mark Antony, or Marcus Antonius, was a Roman politician and general.   He was assigned Romes eastern provinces, including theclient kingdom of Egypt, then ruled byCleopatra. It comes days after an ancient royal hall dating back to the era of Ramses II was previously discovered near to the identied Cleopatra site. It was unearthed below soft-brick buildings and commercial residential areas. The hall was used to hold royal celebrations such as the Jubilee feast.

Researchers from the National Scientic and Technical Research Councilbelieve the Inca woman had “outstanding social prestige” in the community towards the end of the Inca Empire in the th century. According to Dr Clarisa Otero, the remains were found  centimetres below the surface with ceramic objects, jewellery, animal bones and metal plates placed around her.   She said: “This discovery reinforced the ideas we have about pre-Hispanic funerary practices and in turn gives us new and valuable information. The absence of a coffin to contain the corpse and the presence of fauna shows that the woman was partially or completely exposed.This implies that once the body was buried in the courtyard, it was not moved. She added: “Although we know that her first years of le did not take place at the site, due to the types of offerings found at her grave, her role in the community would have been important.”   Experts believe that the woman came from an elite group from the region of Tahuantinsuyo and was in the area of Tilcara when the Spanish arrived. Dr Otero said: “The first thing we found was the woman’s skull, which was unexpected as graves were usually dug in the corners of homes.” After finding the skull, specialists were able to nearly complete the woman’s entire skeleton. There have been no further updates on her expected age and cause of death as the excavation continues.

All you are really thinking about day-to-day is the next game and getting three points.“Maybe afterwards there will be people talking about it and you are pleased you’ve got a win for him because it is the first time he’s been here.“Before a game, though, it’s not something we’re thinking about.”And,Nesbitt and his team-mates would have liked to have played better in front of the man who pays their wages, he believes the owner could take encouragement from the way United battled for three big points.In danger of being detached at the turn of the year, back-to-back defeats for Ross County and Ayr have left United just one win off the pace in the battle for automatic promotion.And,the former Celtic kid would have liked to have put on a better show for everyone who was at Tannadice, he knows getting the job done mattered most.“Three points and the results where went our way, that makes it a good day.“It was, obviously, a bit of a battle but we got there in the end and that’s what matters.Performance-wise it wasn’t the best and we would expect to play a lot better than that and put on a show but sometimes circumstances in a game mean it doesn’t go that way and then you need to grind it out and win it.”If Nesbitt was nothing like satisfied with his own display, he had the consolation of knowing for the second week running he played a part in a vital goal.His debut against Partick saw him win the penalty to earn United a point and on Saturday he provided the cross for Nicky Clark’s dramatic late winner.“It’s good to contribute when you’re new and I’ve done that in my first two games.“My game play against Dunfermline wasn’t good enough but to make contributions is important andI’m still making those contributions when I’m playing better I will be happy.”In setting up the all-important goal, Nesbitt showed character. He had not been happy with his performance but he wasn’t going to hide.“I had a pass that went nowhere and, before the goal, a cross that went right to their keeper.“When that happens you can put your head down and go into a shell, especially in a game like that one but you just need to keep going, believe in yourself.“I kept going and when I saw Cammy I cut it back to him. It came back out to me and I saw a couple of boys running. Nicky made a brilliant run and when I saw him I just put it in that area and let him meet it. He’s done that and finished brilliantly. It was scrappy but one good ball and one good header and it’s a good day.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c41d925525d28.88073341.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds sam stanton does not want to experience another scottish cup shock","story":"Sam Stanton has been on both ends of cup shocks in his time, and it’s the feeling when he was on the wrong end of one that makes him determined to make sure Dundee United win their fourth-round tie against Montrose.As a Hibs player, Stanton was part of the side that made an unexpected exit at the hands of Raith Rovers.That painful memory is one he does not want to experience again.“I’ve actually had good and bad in the cup and, hopefully, this can be another good memory,” said the midfielder.“When I was at Dumbarton, we had a couple of games where we weren’t expected to win and did, so that was a nice feeling.“But, when I was at Hibs, we were beaten by Raith and that definitely wasn’t a nice experience.“They were in the Championship and we were in the Premier League, so everyone expected us to get through. It wasn’t good when we lost.“That feeling is one you don’t want again and results like that one just show you can’t take anything for granted.“Teams in Scotland in all the leagues have good players and,you don’t have the proper approach, you will have problems.”And Stanton expects Montrose to battle tooth and nail to cause a shock tomorrow but believes United will be ready to cope with that.“These are dficult games because you know one team is giving everything they can to beat you because they have that nothing-to-lose mentality about them.“I’ve been there myself in those cup-ties when I was with Dumbarton, where you play teams who are bigger than your club and you don’t normally play against.“It excites you and it’s a chance for you to show how good you are. It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4079a3cf34a9.68815705.jpg ","title":"dundee winger andy dales looking to make instant impact","story":"Dundee winger Andy Dales is hoping to hit the ground running after checking in at Dens Park on loan from Scunthorpe United.The -year-old former Derby County youth academy product has joined up with the Dark Blues until the end of the season and goes straight into the squad for Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth-round visit of Queen of the South.It was a deal that was agreed quickly, so much so, the England C international had to race north on Monday morning to complete the move.He has been in training with Jim McIntyre’s men since and is hoping to make his debut at Dens this weekend.“It’s been really good, I had a little chat with the gaffer on Tuesday morning and have had some intense training sessions so I’m really looking forward to it,” said Dales.“I only found out on Monday morning.

I’ve enjoyed it, the lads, the training, everything about it has been good,” said the man who is teaming up again with boss Jim McIntyre after their time together at Ross County.“The fitness levels are really good and the lads are at it. You can see they are up for the fight and there is some really good quality here, there’s no doubt about that, so it’s looking promising.”And the Liverpudlian believes three weeks off has given Dundee the chance to recharge their batteries.“I think the break has been a good thing, mentally in particular. I’ve been in this position and sometimes when you are in that rut when you are finding it dficult to pick up points it’s nice to have that break.“Mentally and physically you get away from it and then you come back in like it’s almost a new season, so I think it has been welcome.“And the mood here has been good but I don’t think I’ve been surprised by that because the lads know there is enough here and we are adding a few more bodies, so we know we have what’s needed.“We are up for a fight and you can see that looking round.”Curran believes that willingness, starting with tomorrow’s cup-tie, to do whatever it takes to get wins will be vital in the coming weeks.“There are times when it’s not going to be pretty because of where we’re at. There is going to be that sense of anxiousness going into games but we have that hunger and drive to overcome that.“There might be games that are ugly but these are ones we need to make sure we go on and win.“Whether we scrap it out - or -, we have to win and, once we do, we can then go and play a bit like I know we are capable of.”If, on paper, Dundee have been handed the perfect opportunity to report back with a win by being paired with a side from the second tier, Curran knows they’ll have to perform to make the next round.His time at Tannadice taught him there are decent outfits in that ision and, after facing them twice, he puts Queens in that category.“This is not going to be an easy game, just because they are in the Championship, no one can think that.“They have boys who are good players – Stephen Dobbie is on fire right now with his goals.“So, the mentality is the one thing we have to make sure is right and that’s not something I think we have an issue with. We have to make sure we come out on top, that’s our aim.”Curran also took the opportunity to stress he left United on good terms and thanked Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson for allowing him to move early in the January window.“I had a good relationship with Robbie and I only have good things to say about him.“The style he wanted was to play with one striker and Pavol Safranko has been the best player at United by a margin, I feel.“I understood that and he understood what an opportunity this move was for me.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"equal-pay-glasgow-city-council-to-sell-assets-to-its-own-property-firm-to-fund-500m-deal","story":"Glasgow City Council will sell off valuable assets to its own property company - then pay to lease them back to fund the equal pay settlement."},{"url":null,"title":"cockroach-and-bedbug-alert-for-glasgow-teachers-city-schools-riddled-with-insects","story":"CONCERNS have been raised about the health of teachers after dozens of complaints about bed bugs and cockroaches in South Side schools."},{"url":null,"title":"livid-homeowners-in-crunch-talks-with-glasgow-city-council-over-missed-bin-collections","story":"CRUNCH talks between council bosses and fed-up residents have taken place in a bid to solve an ongoing bin collection dispute."},{"url":null,"title":"mary-queen-of-scots-stars-saoirse-ronan-and-jack-lowden-in-glasgow-pub","story":"STARS of the hit new film Mary Queen of Scots have been spotted in a city pub."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-shut-out-of-plans-for-asylum-seeker-accommodation-in-castlemilk","story":"RESIDENTS opposed to plans to turn an empty care home into asylum seeker accommodation say they have been lsquoshut outrsquo by developers."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-give-away-free-burgers-all-week","story":"MCDONALDS is giving away free burgers all week in a bid to help customers beat those January blues."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-subway-incident-at-west-street-mean-services-suspended","story":"UPDATE:Man dead after being hit by train on Glasgow Subway during rush-hour.

In the Spa Retreat she met acupuncturist Craig Bryson, who has close to  years experience in perfecting the ancient and traditional holistic treatment.Craig’s healing powers certainly helped to put a spring back in her step, which continued long after our Caribbean golden sunkissed tans had faded away.That the journey aboard the Britannia was in itself magic is no surprise.

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new south ayrshire headteacher bagged","story":"NewsNew South Ayrshire headteacher has bagged dream jobGaenor Hardy,, has assumed control at Heathfield in Ayr, complete with its  pupil roll and  child nursery.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsGaenor Hardy \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new boss of South Ayrshire’s biggest primary school has bagged her “dream job”.

My twins came here and I feel that level of affinity. “All I see is potential. I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school. It is there within me already. “I feel like I’m in a bubble of looking forward to coming to work and being so motivated – and I’m still waiting for it to be burst.” Now Gaenor, who is often seen walking to school, is planning to get her pupils into shape as part of a new physical and mental drive. She said: “If I want the children to be fit and healthy then I have to model that. “Health and wellbeing has to underpin everything we’re doing. “The local junor parkrun is an example of something I’d like to see encouraged. “We’ve also rolled out more than  after-school and lunch clubs from this month. “I’ll be doing a homework club and the clerical team are doing a running club so we’re all very hands on. “But ultimately the children are my inspiration. “We have a fantastic new building in which to work and I’ve never experienced anything like it during my career. “Now the challenge is to make the most of it and enjoy what we have.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"new super school riddled structural","story":"NewsNew super-school is riddled with structural problemsLeaks, faulty automatic doors and sensory lights are among a string of issues at Invergarven’s marquee campus in Girvan.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsInside the school \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new pound million super-school is “riddled” with structural problems, it can been revealed.

Council chiefs, who hailed the building as a huge boost for education, admit they have hit “snagging issues”. One senior source said: “The place was leaking like a sieve. “You expect the odd snag with any new building but this is far more than that. “It seems like the pressure was on to move in on time and clearly things haven’t been ready. “To be fair the place has been riddled with problems since day one.” The Post understands that a squad of up eight workers have been sent in to fix ongoing problems. And staff have still to be trained in using the hydrotherapy pool some five months after the school’s opening. Girvan councillor, Iain Fitzsimmons, said: “The school is going to be a great facility for this area. “The staff are also incredibly hard working and deserve a lot of praise. “I am assured that a

staff, children, parents and the community on a fantastic new facility that’s helping to transform education for children and young people. “The hydrotherapy pool is in full working order and staff are currently being trained to make the best use of this central new feature. “Our contract also provides for snagging issues to be dealt with as and when required.”

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside. She said: \"There is so much fear about Alabama rot because not much is known about it. Its impossible to say where Georgie got it, she could have picked it up anywhere.\"We still walk by the river most days, we arent scared to walk there but I do make sure I get the mud off after.\"\"My advice to other dog owners is to be aware and on the lookout for sores on your dog.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mammoth-catch-at-this-years-selkirk-haggis-hunt","story":"MORE than  hunters headed onto Selkirk Hill at the weekend in search of the illusive haggis.And, as was forecast by organisers, they ed with a record catch.Glorious sunshine and crisp footing made for an excellent mornings sport.And for the first time in the historic huntrsquos history, woolly mammoth haggi were caught on the breeding grounds.Dave Scott from the organising committee told us: ldquoThe woolly mammoth haggi is an ancient strain of our beloved creature and they were plentul in Selkirk for the first time this year.ldquoFor decades it was thought they were extinct, but we have noticed more and more of these large colourful haggi here in Selkirk when weve been doing our inspections.\"There was a fear that theyd be like grey squirrels and scare away the smaller indigenous haggi but they all seem to live happily together.\"Were not sure why they migrated to Selkirk Hill but were happy to have them.ldquoEvery year there are more and more hunters but we are lucky having such tremendous breeding grounds that our haggis numbers remain fairly solid.As has become customary over the decades, the hunters were piped from the Market Place at .am.And, as superstition insists, the Haggis Polka was danced outside the Argus Centre to bring luck.Matthew Burgess, who took over as head huntsman from his late father Bob, made sure the strict rules were adhered to before toasting the haggis on competition of the dayrsquos sport.Mr Burgess told us: ldquoThere can be few better sights than  tartan clad hunters marching towards Selkirk Hill.ldquoOur forefathers maintained this wonderful tradition even when haggis was scarce, and their hard work has meant that today the next generation will never go hungry on Burns Night.Experts, many with with red noses, within the Townrsquos Arms hunt headquarters weighed in more than  haggi on Sunday afternoon ndash including more than  of the recently discovered woolly mammoth strain.Townrsquos Arms mine host Louise Stephen, who provided the pre- and post-hunt whisky toast, was delighted with the dayrsquos sport.She said: ldquoFewany left the hill without a catch.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-a-play-a-pie-and-a-pint-15-years-and-500-plays","story":"Chamberlain is auditioning later on, and she has  plays to cast.

This shows the range of material which has made its way onto Oran Morrsquos stage in a low-budget, low-risk way light-years away from a prevailing corporate philosophy of big-budget event-based shows.This includes revisiting the debut plays by David Ireland and Denise Mina, as well as favourite shows about comedian Chic Murray, Dusty Springfield and Fe-born darts player, Jocky Wilson. Irelandrsquos play, What The Animals Say, heralded a career which has seen one of his most recent plays, Cyprus Avenue, win numerous awards, while his Traverse Theatre hit, Ulster American, is about to tour to Australia and Ireland. Also revived is Aye, Elvis, Morna Youngrsquos comedy about a female Elvis Presley impersonator.ldquoAfter  years it seems like the right moment to look back, and to celebrate, says Chamberlain.As Fullarton points out, it is also an opportunity to revisit pieces which have all but disappeared from view.ldquoOne of the things about the shows at A Play, A Pie and A Pint is that theyrsquore only on for a week, she says, ldquoso unless the writers and directors can get producers and other theatres interested, they disappear, and there are some cracking plays which deserve the chance of a wider audience, or to be expanded.

Chamberlain, meanwhile, co-founded production company The Comedy Unit, responsible for numerous much-loved TV sit-coms.While things have become more streamlined in terms of the day to day running of the company since the early days of PPP, all those involved since have nevertheless retained the sense of low-risk immediacy which MacLennan championed, and despite receiving Creative Scotland funding in a way it might have previously steered clear of, remains a small operation.ldquoOne of the great joys of A Play, A Pie and A Pint for the writers, says Fullarton, ldquois that your play can be on in three months, and it doesnrsquot have to hang around for a year waiting for lots of executive producers to make decisions.

Ghost, known by its registration plate AX , was built by Rolls-Royce in  and soon earned global fame for its quietness, luxuriousness and price.It is considered something of a holy grail among enthusiasts and is thought to be the most valuable motor in the world, with an insured value of pound million.Last year, Rolls-Royce launched a new, limited edition car to commemorate the history of AX , named the Silver Ghost Collection.Just  were produced and are on sale for hundreds of thousands of pounds.But a curious fact about the carrsquos famous Spirit Of Ecstasy hood ornament has come to light almost a year after it first launched ndash and one that Rolls-Royce has not even advertised to the public.The bottom of the statue on the bonnet of the  Silver Ghost Collection models contains a small copper ingot, marked with the AX  insignia of the original car.Rolls-Royce enthusiast Ruth Blair has revealed the copper is, in fact, taken from a pipe on the original  car that has been melted down and placed on to the  model in homage to the Silver Ghost.Mrs Blair, a charity fundraiser who has a farm near Cumbernauld, said she acquired copper from the original Silver Ghost after it was reconditioned in  by Rolls-Royce heritage experts Paul and Andy Wood.The brothers replaced some copper piping from the engine bay of AX  and ious steel components, and kept them for  years, waiting for an appropriate way to use them.In  they gave the metal to Mrs Blair, who at the time was creating a miniature Rolls-Royce for children that she eventually sold to raise money for charity.Realising the immense value of the parts, she sold them back to Rolls-Royce in  for an undisclosed amount of money and suggested the manufacturer create a limited edition tribute car to its most famous model.The company then commissioned  cars and has sent them all over the world to be sold to wealthy collectors, investors and enthusiasts.Last night, a sales representative of the Leven Car Company said the source of the ingot was kept a secret until salesmen could be sure a potential buyer was serious about purchasing the car.Details of the car were also kept out of the public domain to protect the Rolls-Royce brand.A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said: ldquoThirty-fiveof the extraordinary and exceptional Silver Ghost Collection have been created by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.ldquoInidually, as customers purchase these cars, they are intrigued to discover the provenance of the small copper ingot at the foot of the Spirit Of Ecstasy, and are surprised and delighted at its origins.After researching the car on its release last year, Mrs Blair realised the company had not advertised that the copper at the base of its hood ornament had come from the original AX .She told The Herald she acquired and then sold the copper from the Silver Ghost, and that it had been kept a secret from Rolls-Roycersquos own potential customers.Her husband, John Blair, who is a former car salesman, travelled to the Rolls-Royce factory at Goodwood, West Sussex, while the cars were being manufactured.He learned that even the engineers working on the Silver Ghost collectionrsquos construction had not been told by the companyrsquos executives where the materials had come from.To practise creating a copper ingot, and not wishing to use the precious century-old copper, Rolls-Royce bought some of the material from a local scrapyard to create a prototype of what would become the limited edition Spirit of Ecstasy, she said.Now only one of the cars remains in the UK, at the Leven Car Company in Edinburgh.Mrs Blair still owns steel wheel assembly nuts, coach bolts and a starting handle spring from the Silver Ghost.And she says she is looking for a partner who may be able to help her rework or redevelop them.ldquoI originally gave them all the parts ndash the steel and the copper ndash and they gave me the steel parts back, she said.ldquoJohn took the parts down to Manchester, and everyone seemed to have an interest in the copper rather than the steel.ldquoIf you see a picture of AX , yoursquoll see itrsquos got circular bolts around the wheels, and

freshly-created spirit from Scottish distilleries and not blend it with others.The company then matured the whisky itself in barrels used to make other spirits.The so-called single-malt, which at the time made up a vanishingly small proportion of the worldrsquos whisky market, was championed by curators who wanted to develop unique flavours.The firm now has a huge collection of whiskies from historic and long-closed distilleries that it occasionally bottles and puts on the market.Now, after  years of maturing a whisky from the Glen Grant distillery, Gordon  MacPhail has uncorked the barrel and is selling bottles to customers for pound, each.For Stephen Rankin, director of prestige, whose great-grandfather John Urquhart selected the whisky for the company collection on June , , tasting Glen Grant for the first time is an ldquoemotional experience.He tried a dram from the cask with his cousin, who also works for the company.ldquoIn a nutshell, itrsquos incredibly smooth, incredibly mellow, but itrsquos got a huge amount of character and flavour, he says.ldquoWhen you drink something of this sort of age, it takes you back in time to things that were going on back then, in .ldquoYoursquore thinking about the Geneva Convention, which was to come out not long after that. It was years before we started putting men in space, and while ious things have happened, this whisky has quietly matured throughout all of that.Gordon  MacPhail competed with blended whiskies from labels such as Johnnie Walker and Chivas Regal in an approach that was considered eccentric at the time. The company refers to itself as a ldquocurator and creator,not a distiller.Mr Rankin describes the Glen Grant as having a dizzying array of flavours, including vanilla fudge, strawberries, raspberries, white stone fruit, orange peel, cinnamon, mahogany, mint and cardamom.It began le as spirit, produced by the Glen Grant distillery in Rothes, near Elgin. At the time, the distillery would have used traditional whisky-making practices and burned peat as fuel in its distillery.Gordon  MacPhail, located in Elgin, bought a cask of the spirit and began to mature it in a cask that had transported sherry from Spain. As the spirit matured into whisky, it borrowed the other spiritrsquos flavours, left over in the wood of the barrel.For the next  years, the cask stayed with the company, being checked regularly by members of the Urquhart family to measure the rate of maturation and the impact of the wood on the spirit.Last October, the family finally decided the whisky had reached its ideal maturity, and has produced  bottles from the -litre cask to be sold as part of its Private Collection range.The Private Collection is a selection of whiskies chosen by members of the Urquhart family from closed or little-known distilleries, which sell for huge amounts of money.It has a collection of whisky from  distilleries in Scotland, of which  no longer exist.Last year, a bottle of the companyrsquos  Glenlivet whisky sold at auction for more than pound,.The Glen Grant is bottled at the cask strength of . per cent in a hand-blown crystal decanter and will be sold on the market for pound,.Mr Rankin says there are three types of people who typically pay thousands for a bottle: collectors, investors, and what he calls the ldquoRegular Joes, for whom the history of a whisky and its rare flavours prove too much to resist.ldquoItrsquos like an antique, he says. ldquoIt cannot be recreated. You cannot go back to the s to remake this, and whisky back then was made dferently. People want to try things the way it was. Wersquove had regular people who probably live in suburbia, for example, but the story of the whisky will touch them on a level you canrsquot understand, because itrsquos personal to them.ldquoIt might be when their mother or father was born, or when their business was started, or when they were born. Therersquos lots of emotional tie-ins.For Mr Rankin, the emotion of drinking the  spirit comes from knowing it is members of his own family that have looked after the cask for decades.He said: ldquoMy grandfather George would have had a signicant role in the selection of whiskies, and he would have done this overseen by his father. He would then have passed on the skills to analyse and check maturing whisky to his children.

Did an X on a ballot paper ever create the change you really want  Politics has failed across the west. To apply the word ldquouseless to politicians of all stripes is to be kind. But systems can be reformed, even the rotten stagnant ones in the UK ndash and the national disaster thatrsquos Brexit could be the catalyst for change.The issue of a Citizensrsquo Assembly, as a means to resolve the Brexit crisis, is now moving on to the stage ndash andwe go for it,we truly give power to the people through Citizensrsquo Assemblies, then we could transform our dying democracy into the most vibrant democracy on Earth.Citizensrsquo Assemblies are about ordinary people ndash you and I ndash honestly informing the thinking of other ordinary people without the involvement of any politician whatsoever.If yoursquore a little unclear about what a Citizensrsquo Assembly does, then look to the west and see what Ireland has been doing of late ndash a country which has transformed itself into one of the few healthy democracies in Europe with an engaged and informed electorate.In , Ireland knew it had to deal with the issue of abortion. A previous referendum more than  years before had been ugly and isive. So, Ireland looked back to the founders of democracy in ancient Athens and experimented with a Citizensrsquo Assembly ndash giving real say to the people, allowing ordinary voters to shape the debate.Some  randomly-selected Irish citizens, with a back-up team of another  in case of drop-outs or sickness, were chosen to become what amounted to a jury on abortion. Like a jury they were meant to be representative of the population in terms of age, sex, class and geography. They were chaired by a judge, had staff attached to them to take notes and give advice ndash effectively their own civil service ndash and they met every weekend for  months to hear evidence and discuss abortion, and four other topics. The  were split into smaller groups so they could interrogate evidence and witnesses in microscopic detail.Citizen Assembly members could call anyone they liked to speak to them. On the issue of abortion there were , submissions and they heard from every shade of opinion. The hearings were public and streamed live online, so every nuanced piece of evidence, every statistic, every medical fact and figure was relayed to Irelandrsquos . million citizens as the assembly heard submissions.As on a jury, it is hard under such circumstances to keep your mind closed, or to fall back on your beliefs rather than what the evidence of your eyes and ears is telling you. Hard-working facts will defeat lazy opinion.Politicians in elections and referendums do not try to convince us with detail and evidence ndash they play fast and loose with the truth, and they manipulate our prejudices and emotions. Politicians want us to be uninformed as then we can be swayed ndash as Brexit showed, with a bewildered, confused electorate making choices to leave or remain based on their gut and their heart, not their mind and the facts.In , after their long deliberations, the Irish Citizensrsquo Assembly members voted ndash and  per cent recommended that the Dail allow abortion in Ireland. It was asthe tide went out and never came back in again. It marked a sea-change in Ireland. The facts ndash the truth ndash had been pored over in minute detail and when the national referendum campaign on abortion began no-one could get away with a cheap lie, or a manipulative advert as the public had been informed.In the end, Ireland approved abortion by  to . The idea of a deferential Ireland tagging along behind the Catholic Church was dead, and the nation stepped forward as a progressive, clever, flexible and informed democracy ndash one that Britain with its tarnished travesty of a democracy should envy.It isnrsquot just Ireland where Citizensrsquo Assemblies have been tested. In the Netherlands, an assembly looked at ndash and recommended ndash electoral reform in Japan, it was nuclear power in Poland, they looked at flood prevention and migration Texas used one on energy Canada for health.Citizensrsquo Assemblies would transform our adversarial democracy into a deliberative democracy, one in which thought, consideration and consensus are the brokers, not lies. The worst elements of populism would be leashed ndash as who could say, when it came to the big issues, that power did not lie with the people. In this age of unreason, we would start to restore truth fake news would be fought with fact.Citizensrsquo Assemblies would also restore that most important part of democracy ndash compromise, something which we have lost. Without compromise there can be no democracy, only the tyranny of the majority.Citizensrsquo Assemblies could unlock a peaceful non-isive path by which we could resolve our most intractable problems. For a start, we could reform our defunct UK-wide voting system which keeps two Jurassic parties in power and smothers new, interesting and representative voices.A Citizensrsquo Assembly on Climate Change would silence forever the nonsense of climate denial ndash in a forum of facts, the climate deniers would be reduced to the status of flat-earthers. And surely, a Citizensrsquo Assembly here in Scotland on the question of independence would allow the people to truly get to grips with the issues that were puppeteered by Better Together and the Yes campaign last time around.

Such rash statements and empty promises from Brexiters really do need to be robustly challenged. It would be very interesting to know how many \"free trade\" deals with other countries Dr Fox has secured since the  Referendum Are we really to believe that the UK will be able to secure better trade deals with these countries than the ones that we already enjoy as members of the EU  This is just one example of the nonsense that we are expected to take on board from the Brexiters.Dr Fox knows very well that we live in a representative democracy where our Members of Parliament are given the responsibility of acting in the best interests of the country. The Brexit referendum was purely advisory and while Parliament voted to honour the narrow decision to leave the EU, clearly circumstances have changed dramatically. The full costs of our departure from the EU are becoming ever more apparent. We have the extraordinary situation where our leaders from finance, business, manufacturing, transport, the NHS, the hospitality industry, the academic world have united to warn that our country is facing perhaps years of depression. This stark analysis is confirmed by the Governmentrsquos own projections. None of the ious options being touted round will leave the UK in a stronger position than we are just now as members of the EU. With Parliament so hopelessly ided, the decision has to be given back to the people.Hopefully our MPs will not behave like their counterparts in Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe and leave \"that brain outside and vote just as their leaders tell lsquoem to\" but rather unite to act in the best interests of the people that they have been elected to represent and serve.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.IN , as a naive \"Wilsonista\", I voted to remain in the European Economic Community . I was too ill-informed thento realise that the EEC was the first big step towards the political union of Europe. Then, the political and media \"sophisticates\"deliberately concealed the trajectory towards an end-state of European political union now, the elites patronise and sneer at the working class who do not share their bourgeois superior vision and moral virtue on the EU.In the s , I came to realise that I did not want a European superstate dominated by France and Germany, supported by a payroll vote of smaller nations, and funded disproportionately by the British taxpayer. I was against joining the euro, because a monetary union cannot work without a banking union, a debt union, a fiscal union and a political union. Accordingly, the single currency and its dogged maintenance has bankrupted Greece, brought Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland to the brink of economic disaster, and impoverished millions by unemployment. Even Germanyis teetering on the edge of recession. Yet those European countries not in the euro, but having their own flexible currency exchange rates , create jobs and \"do alright\".Furthermore, and after events in the s in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia , Kosovo, and, more recently, Ukraine, it has not been the EU, but Nato, that has stabilised peace in Europe with British and American interventions.Yet, despite the evidence above, Remainers inside and outside Parliament press on to keep the UK in the EU. But they cannot convince voters of the benefits of the customs union and the common external tarf, the single market, the \"common rule-book\", the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy and the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. Remainers may well succeed in destroying a real Brexit on WTO unilateral free trade terms ndash what they call \"crashing out\", \"no deal\" ndash and imply the abrupt end of trade between the UK and the EU . All Remainers have to do is persuade Parliament to rescind Article  or to extend it beyond the scheduled departure date of March .No doubt, as \"good Europeans\", Remainers would then expect the UK to participate in the European Parliament election on May . Would that election not constitute a second EU referendum  Would they not get hammeredby \"Tell them again Vote Leave\" candidates  Would they then demand a third referendum Richard Mowbray, Ancaster Drive, Glasgow.I GATHER that there are a group of hardcore Remain supporters who are rejoicing at the prospect of the \"Deatherendum\", the process by which the passing of senescent old doddererslike me, who had the effrontery prejudices to vote Leave in the  referendum, removes us from the Electoral Register, our places being taken by a cohort of youngsters, whose enthusiastic, uncritical acclaim of the glorious European superstate would sweep Remain to a convincing victory in any subsequent poll.While it is true that a disproportionate number of older voters tended to vote Leave , the overall narrowness of the Leave victory would lead me to suspect that a substantial number of SODs voted Remain. So unless these Remainers can precisely control where the Grim Reapers scythe swings, they had better be careful for what they wish.In the meantime,its not too late, I will be paying a bit more

collaboration between Glasgow University academics and teachers has paved the way for the French version of the  graphic book Asterix and the Picts to be used in primary schools as a language resource.The move is part of a wider initiative between the university and curriculum body Education Scotland to produce a range of new online teaching materials based on academic research.A total of  resources have been created for pupils in primary and the first three years of secondary school, including the history of the Vikings in Scotland, political songs and poems and medieval history.In addition, Polish films will also be used as a language resource while pupils can learn about the hundreds of Scots words used to describe snow.Other topics focus on prehistoric monuments in urban areas, the art of storytelling in computer games and le in high rise blocks of flats.Pupils will also leanr about how others view Scotland through films such as Brigadoon and Loch Ness.A scene from BrigadoonThe resources all take dferent forms, but generally consist of materials such as lesson plans, slide shows, workbooks, edited texts, audio files, videos and pictures or photographs.Laurence Grove, Professor of French Text and Image Studies at the university, who help secure the copyrite to allow the Asterix book to be used, said the familiar characters were an ideal way to engage pupils.He said: ldquoAsterix is the worldrsquos biggest-selling book series because generations of children have been drawn into the stories.ldquoThese books encapsulate a lot of human character, but they are also fun which means children will learn more about the French language.Launching the resources at Glasgow University, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he hoped other universities would be inspired to work on school materials.He said: ldquoWhat most excites me is that we are bringing high quality research from academics together with the skills and knowledge of teachers to make really exciting resources for all.ldquoThe Asterix books were very much part of my childhood and it is lovely to see these stories and characters having such longevity and being used to inspire future generations.John Swinney at Glasgow UniversityldquoI was also fascinated by the topic on housing in high places, which is a real insight into th century Scotland and the improvement in the quality of le that high rise living meant for so many, but also how that concept did not deliver everything that people had hoped for.The collaboration, which started as a pilot in , is run by academics Professor Dauvit Broun and Dr Joanna Tucker and Lynne Robertson, from Education Scotland.Mr Broun, director of the universityrsquos ArtsLab, which supports research-led activities, said teachers and academics had produced original, creative and useful resources which could be used by any teacher in Scotland.He said: ldquoThe strength of this scheme is that it allows researchers to work with schools in a way that is truly collaborative, and produces resources which speak directly to the needs of those actually working in the classroom.ldquoWorking with school teachers has been extremely rewarding, since they approach the subjects in such a creative and open way, which challenges us researchers to rethink our own work.ldquoWhen designing this scheme, it was fundamental that the teachers be in the driving seat, steering what the resources would look like, since they have the real experience of what works in the classroom.Ms Tucker, arts and humanities innovation researcher, said the scheme was part of a new era where schools and universities would work together more closely.She added: ldquoAs university researchers our work does not always fit directly with the subjects taught and examined in schools.ldquoThe scheme demonstrates the common purpose of learning, regardless of whether it is in a primary classroom or a lecture theatre.Mrs Robertson said a group of senior education officers at Education Scotland had worked with the researchers to establish what would work best.She said: ldquoIt is our job to take a decision on what aspects within the research areas will work in schools.ldquoThen our role is to help the university recruit the teachers that would be the right fit to work with the academics.ldquoA good example is the medieval resource where we have created about  dferent topics which lets children explore more than just the traditional subjects of kings and queens or battles.ldquoThe kings and queens are there too and that is important, but this also allows them to explore the lives of ordinary people like them as well as what it would have been like to live at that time.Mrs Robertson said the flexibility within the resources was key to allowing teachers to chose what topics would engage their pupils, but everything included was backed up with high quality university research.The scheme is funded by the universityrsquos ArtsLab which supports research-led activities in the College of Arts.ArtsLab pays for the teachersrsquo time while Education Scotland provides support for the scheme by recruiting teachers and curating the resources online."},{"url":null,"title":"cbi-report-no-deal-brexit-would-cost-scotland-14bn-a-year","story":"The study of the UK Government figures points to Scotland being among the areas of the UK

He has since inspired Scotlands forgotten secondary school pupils to follow in his footsteps via his childrens charity, The Polar Academy.On his , he spoke about his -day adventure to school pupils and organisations across the country.He was also invited to a reception at the Scottish Parliament where he struck up a conversation with the then First Minister, a former school teacher.Craig said: “We discussed the fact that schools hadn’t changed much since I had been a pupil.“There were three groups of children in every school – the elite pupils from good, solid backgrounds the troubled youngsters at the other end of the scale and the forgotten group in the middle – that’s the kids that I really wanted to help.”In training...Bathgate Academy pupils are preparing for their expedition in April, which will cost The Polar Academy #,. When Craig s, he will start working with young people on the Isle of Lewis and Isle of Harris and his fundraising mission will start all over again.Craig asked Jack McConnell what he could do to help these forgotten youngsters and the politician’s response surprised Craig.He said: “He agreed with me that there were forgotten children – he had witnessed the same thing as a teacher.“But he asked me what I was going to do about it!”Inspired by that chat, Craig wondered whether he could inspire youngsters by training them for their own polar expeditions.Sleeping under the stars, pupils who undertake the Greenland expeditions with Craig gain a lot of le experience which boosts their confidence...they also enjoy views like this of the aurora borealis.As a pilot, for a year he trained a Braes High School pupil from Falkirk, Chris Struthers, for an expedition to the North Pole.And on April , , they both made it to the Pole.Chris subsequently applied to university, studied as a geologist and has worked all over the globe, most recently as a geology lecturer in Auckland.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Message from the Skies winners, Arianne, Louise and Nathan, winners of Message from the Skies outside the Tron Kirk in Edinburgh\"  Falkirk teens win Edinburgh writing competition viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FALK | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FALK | Article Teaser\"And that pilot pole trip also had le-changing consequences for Craig, cementing in his mind that he could make a dference in young peoople’s lives.In , he packed in his job at an accountancy firm, taking a  per cent pay cut overnight, to launch his children’s charity, The Polar Academy.It is a decision he has never regretted and he has since worked with  schools all over Scotland, taking scores of youngsters on five separate expeditions.The resultant success of The Polar Academy’s pupils speaks volumes about what Craig has achieved.He said: “The children we work with often have little confidence in their abilities but they all have one thing in common – a real spark.“Each pupil undergoes  months of arduous training to prepare them for the expedition. And when they , they have to speak to around , fellow pupils about their experiences.“We see them transform from painfully shy youngsters into young adults who are confident enough to lead the expedition.“Our pupils have gone on to study at university and be leaders in their fields. It’s le-changing for them.” Craig is currently working with Bathgate Academy pupils who, on April , will leave for an -day trip to Greenland.And when he s, he will start working with a new group of pupils – at the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway and the Sir E Scott School in West Tarbert.He claims the commute will actually be easier than working with five schools in Edinburgh at the one time!But as well as training and coaching the youngsters, Craig has the not-so-small task of raising £, for each and every trip.He would dearly love to work with more schools every year but, with no government funding, he is reliant on businesses and members of the public to help fund the charity.Craigsaid: “If I moved to Norway tomorrow, I would be able to fund five or six expeditions every year.“They are years ahead of us in viewing outdoor pursuits as educational and beneficial for youngsters.“The problem is, I don’t want to live in Norway!“That means I have to try to raise £, every year for the expedition.“When I’m out with the begging bowl, it’s time I could be spending with the pupils.“We have some amazing supporters, including Chris Tiso who has been a long-term sponsor.“However, sadly, the question I most often get asked here in Scotland is not how The Polar Academy benefits youngsters but rather how the charity can help businesses.“The demands of some organisations would actually cost The Polar Academy in the long-run.“It’s sad but it’s often the case here that businesses are more interested in their own bottom line than the children we help.”However, Craig remains committed to working with the forgotten children he first set out to help.He added: “I’m never going to be rich but it’s the greatest job in the world – I still love it.“It’s incredible to see the youngsters blossom and go on to achieve more than they ever thought possible.“That makes all the fundraising worthwhile.”To find out more about The Polar Academy and how you can help, visit the website www.thepolaracademy.org.Accolades are great but funding is Craig’s main missionNamed Explorer in Residence by the Royal Scottish Geographical Societyin , last year Craig Mathieson was also invited to join the illustrious Explorers Club.Founded in , fellow members include Sir Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Jacques Piccard, Don Walsh, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.Craig will travel from his Bo’ness home to address fellow members in New York this year.He said: “Only those who reach the pinnacle of exploration are asked to join.“To me, it’s like receiving  Olympic gold medals at the one time. You know you have made it as an exploreryou’re asked to join.”It is an amazing accolade but Craig’s main focus remains funding. He has launched a Patrons’ Club which has seven members but he is hoping to attract more.He explained: “Iniduals, companies or syndicates can become a patron, as long as they are willing to donate £, every year for a minimum of three years.“Patrons are not allowed to shout about their support – they are doing it solely to help the children we work with.“We currently have seven patrons but would love to attract at least another ten – that would meet our annual fundraising target and free time up for me to work with the children more.”To become a patron, contact Craig Mathieson on   or email info@thepolaracademy.org.Craig added: “We’d also be delighted to hear from big name sponsors.”Inidual donations can also be made via the charity’s website."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie play centre plans unveiled","story":"Plans have been unveiled for a socially-inclusive soft play centre at an Inverurie industrial estate.Newly-formed charity ‘Because Everyone Counts’ wants to create the facility at a unit owned by Craigdon Mountain Sports at Burghmuir Circle.The group has been founded to provide a safe and inclusive play space for children from the local community from pre-school and nursery school age up to a maximum of  years.The applicants say the facility will be the first inclusive soft play centre within the North-east to offer adapted play to allow those with additional support needs to integrate with mainstream children.In a supporting statement to Aberdeenshire Council’s planning department, they say: “It will work together with local groups and schools such as St. Andrews offering somewhere safe to go.”A separate room will be available for children with limited communication and sensory disorders and will provide multi-sensory equipment.The facility would operate from .am to .pm seven days a week and the expected usage will be for a maximum of  children per day split into two-hour sessions.It is understood that special needs groups will arrive and be collected by mini-bus as will groups from local nurseries.If successful, the soft play centre would take up residence next to the Inverurie Gymnastics Club which also leases a unit.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin\"  MSP welcomes further action on period poverty viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"msp welcomes further action on period poverty","story":"Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin has welcomed further funding to increase the number of places where free sanitary products are available.The announcement was made by Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell and means that between now and for the next financial year, a total of £million will be made available to local authorities, who will deliver the expansion.It will increase the roll-out of the Scottish Government’s world leading action and access beyond schools, colleges and universities.Local authorities will work in partnership with other organisations to meet local needs and increase availability.Ms Martin has been a campaigner for action on period poverty and providing free access to sanitary products including a resolution at SNP Party Conference in  calling for the introduction of an ‘S-card’.In , Aberdeen became the city chosen for a pilot project providing free sanitary products across several regeneration areas in the city.Commenting, Gillian Martin MSP said: “The Scottish Government has led the way with access to sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities.“It is excellent news that it will now go even further by increasing the number of places where these vital products are available which could help to reach more people on low incomes.“Period poverty is a real issue for many women who have to decide between feeding their family and purchasing sanitary products.

Discussions on the future of the service were scheduled to take place in November but were delayed to allow extra time to take residentsrsquo views into account - proposed service changes have been amended as a result.Proposals to close the Insch Household Waste and Recycling Centrehave been removed as a result of public feedback. It is proposed that the centre would stay open two days a week, with the cost to be covered by slightly shortening opening hours at other recycling centres.Changes to kerbside services have also been proposed and, out of the two options consulted on, councillors are recommended to choose the option which will give residents a  litre non-recyclable waste bin to be emptied every three weeks.

Although a dferent option was more popular in the consultation, professional advice is that the alternative is most likely to encourage residents to recycle more and send less waste to landfill.By increasing recycling the proposed change is expected to reduce service costs by at least £, per year, money which will be reinvested into other essential council services.It is also proposed to double the number of seasonal garden waste collection points, with new facilities in locations including Balmedie, Kemnay, Kintore, Mintlaw, Newmachar and Oldmeldrum.Aberdeenshirersquos current recycling rate is only .%, but the services currently available to residents should allow over % of waste to be recycled.

Big Garden Birdwatch participants have made a signicant contribution to monitoring garden bird numbers over the past four decades.

It’s now the largest garden wildle survey in the world and appeals to both children and adults because it’s an enjoyable, easy, inclusive activity that anyone can do and a great opportunity to connect with nature.” As well as counting birds, the RSPB is once again asking participants to log some of the other wildle they have seen throughout the year. This year, people are being asked to look out for badger, fox, grey squirrel, red squirrel, muntjac deer, roe deer, frog and toad.To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch , watch the birds in your garden or local park for one hour at some point over the three days.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Tuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon. We would urge the Scottish Government to uphold its previous promise to start works within this financial year so that the north Highlands can start to see the benefit of this upgrade as soon as possible.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \"R J McLeod Ltd has been awarded the construction contract as part of the pound. million project to deliver improvements to the road alignment and the existing tight hairpin bend on the A.\"Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, hailed it as a positive development for the area. \"It will enhance the skills development of the Scottish construction industry, with approximately  jobs expected to be supported in the region during construction.\"Related articles:Four in running for Berriedale Braes contractSilence on A schemeTuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmPolice in Kirkwall are appealing for witnesses after weightlting equipment was stolen from an address in Stromness last week.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Set in , it sees protagonist Scott and his father James take the car ferry across the Beauly Firth to Inverness as they watch men working on the Kessock Bridge.Scott agrees to attend a farm roup with his father and feels he is being watched by a yellow eye from a dirty painting hanging amongst the lots. Unknown to his father, he successfully bids for it and his le starts to alter in remarkable ways.The action swings between Aberdeen and Florence as Scott embarks on a journey of discovery.Mr Herd, who describes himself as ldquo going on , said time spent alone working on so many films served him.He said: ldquoBy the nature of film work there wasnrsquot a typical day because all trips y. The most memorable film that I have worked on must be Swamp Tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans.ldquoUsing a converted river ferry boat as a mobile base, a typical day would be, rising at four and travelling in the dark to a hide built on stilts embedded in a channel.ldquoI would stay there on my own usually for twelve hours and I did that for months. Being in a hide that long gives you plenty of time to think.ldquoLying awake in bed in the morning, plot ideas and characters nag at me and I have to get up to write about them.ldquoI am a hopeless two-fingered typist which is very frustrating because they canrsquot keep up with whatrsquos going through my head. That aside It does surprise me how easy it is for me to write, I donrsquot know where that comes from. I try to write at least a thousand words a day but quite often Irsquoll hit a brick wall.ldquoI donrsquot worry about that because I know that I will get the inspiration to carry on later.ldquoI try to write about what I know, itrsquos much more convincing and I use locations Irsquove been to. For example, in The Medusa Shield, Scott goes full moon night fishing off the Black Isle coast in a Zulu boat. While I was in India the fishermen on the east coast do that every month.The Medusa Shield is available from Amazon Kindle, Kobo and other digital publishers.Tuesday  Jan  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The programme starting today will culminate with ldquomemory blankets that each participant will design and create.Evanton Wood education co-ordinator Simon Harry said: ldquoThis is a great addition to our summer dementia programme as we have secured funding to continue this programme of activities in the woods throughout the early part of this year.ldquoThe work will be focused at Evanton Community Woods utilising the woodland cabin as a base and using the surrounding forest environment to help bring to le the memories and ideas of the group.ldquoWe will be working closely with local artist Lizzie McDougal who has been a big hit with our group.He added: ldquoLizzie will lead the sessions with input from Evanton Wood staff and volunteers.ldquoThe process will start with two storytelling sessions in which Lizzie will encourage the sharing of memories and stories from each couple within the group. Lizzie and the group will then create sketches from these conversations to use as prompts for the group to aid their design of the memory blanket.The programme is supported by the UK-wide DEEP project , and the blankets will be used at a DEEP gathering to be run at Evanton Woods in the spring. This gathering will be a celebration of all the positive outcomes that those with dementia in the Highlands have achieved.The Evanton Wood programme will run each Friday from .am - pm at the woodland cabin which is a short walk from the top of Chapel Road.Those attending should follow the signs into the wood, and lunch is included.For more information about the activities on offer in Evanton Wood please contact Simon Harry on  or email simon.harry@forest-educationTuesday  Jan  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

However, health chiefs have been accused of dragging their feet over helping to find a sustainable future model to deliver the scheme, which many of the users have said gives them a reason to get up in the morning.The project leader, who is employed by High Le Highland, has been told funding will end this month.

The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1380213.jpg--.jpg?1547207055000\n","title":"57 job losses confirmed by administrator jbe not feasible","story":"The Administrator for JBE Mechanical.Electrical Ltd, the Ballymena based electrical and mechanical firm, has announced that following a review of all options in respect of the business, that it is not feasible for the business to continue to trade.Speaking following a meeting with all staff at the firm’s headquarters at Braid River Business Park in Ballymena, the Administrator Gerard Gildernew said: “Unfortunately, following our review of live contracts and the company order book, I have concluded that it is not feasible to continue trading the business in administration.

They are told with the reverence and respect you would expect from someone whose fictional characters populate the very streets and alleyways he himself walked and walks. These are stories sympathetically woven from yarns shared at wakes and barricades and they are told with all the authenticity and captivating power of a backstreet seanchaí.And while the protagonists are sympathetically drawn — there are no psychopathic terrorist godfathers or feeble-minded IRA cannon-fodder here — there is deceit, treachery and even murder.If your conception of Ballymurphy circa  is based upon the ramblings of our mainstream media commentators scrambling for credibility or the pulp fiction ravings of Jack Higgins, then the short stories in ‘Gáire in Éag’ will be like epistles from another planet. If, however, you actually knew people who stored weapons for the IRA, sheltered republican active service units, engaged in armed struggle for the IRA or even betrayed the IRA — and most probably called them your neighbours — then these stories of ordinary people in extraordinary times is a tonic for the retired troops. Of course, to enjoy this exceptional collection, you will have to be able to read Irish, the literary language of ‘John Boy’ Ó Muireagáin, evennot his mother tongue. That, the author says, is the book#s strength — evenit means not all those who would be able to recognise themselves in its pages will get to enjoy it.“I don’t think you would get a publisher for this book in English,” says Seán . “To be published in English on the topic of our conflict, you need to have a certain point-of-view which often has not even the faintest connection to the reality we experienced. In ‘Idir Dhá Thine Bealtaine’, I tell the story of a woman who kept an arms dump for the IRA. I don’t judge her but I dotell her story as a writer who is very proud of the republican and nationalist people from whom I come. After all, the people who hid IRA weapons were, some might say, more heroic than the people who did the shooting. Every night, they went to sleep dreading the early-morning raid. And yet, no-one is telling the story of those overlooked heroes who are at the core of any revolution ” A member of the extended Ó Muireagáin tribe which spearheaded the Irish language revival in the Upper Springfield area, Seán, now , didn’t start writing until he was well into his forties. “I started with poems about ten years ago,” he says. “They helped me make sense of my own le but about four years ago I started to try my hand at short stories. I wanted to tell the story of my own community, a story which hasn’t been told despite the mountains of books which have been written about us. I felt I could do that in Irish easier than in English. The Irish language community is tighter and more understanding than the larger English language public and you can sidestep the inevitable condemnation which would rain down on anyone who wrote stories with this worldview in English.”His fluent story-telling style is comfortable and engaging and firmly rooted in lives which would be considered humdrum and ordinarythere wasn’t a war raging in the background. His fealty to his subjects is reminiscent of the master Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga who tells the story of an entire people without leaving the tiny mountain village of Obaba. But the Ballymurphy man’s genius with words doesn’t stop there for in setting his stories against the background of the battlefield, he takes up the mantle of Kenya’s greatest author Ngugi wa Thiong’o whose books demolish the previously accepted white-man’s-burden version of the Mau Maustruggle against British colonialism. However, anyone expecting The Victor comicbook-style war stories of republican derring-do is likely to be disappointed.“The stories are about war and conflict at a very personal level how conflict affected the lives of ordinary people,” says Seán. “In ‘Sceithire# , I look at the informer not in traditional black and white republican terms but with empathy for the tout#s family and, of course, with an eye to the mirrors-within-mirrors nether world of informers.”The longest story in the collection, Pól, is a dark, macabre helter-skelter in which an enraged lover sets out on a murderous rampage, covering up his deeds in the undergrowth of Troubles’ killings. “I always wonderedsomeone with malign intent could literally have got away with murder and through Pól I get to let my imagination roam free,” says Seán. “However, no-one should reopen any cold cases all my characters are fictional. True, many are inspired by a titbit of true information or by a real event but ultimately, this is fiction not loose talk.”Seán is keen to let his short stories do the talking for him but he does have a fascinating story of his own to tell — perhaps in memoir form now that he is taking early retirement from the Irish language agency Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta to focus on his writing. A poet, short story writer , a consummate sean-nós singer and even a stand-up comedian, Seán was a renaissance man before the term was invented but his renaissance started with the Irish language.“I am just an ordinary person who had the good luck to discover this Irish language which has nurtured me since I was a teenager,” he says. “Now I want to give back by writing plays, poems and stories which do justice to the ordinary people who make up my community and who have come through the most extraordinary times with their heads held high.”Seán Ó Muireagáin has no plans for an English language translation but what brought Atxaga and Ngugi to a wider audience, the gt of translation, could reveal this gem of a book to a wider audience in the time ahead. Indeed, that would be the perfect way to mark the centenary of our own wee country in !

That’s all we asked and that’s what got.“Peter Healy, Kristian Healy, Odhran Eastwood, boys like that, James McAuley, Joe Maskey – calm heads. Eoin Nagle was fantastic up front.“It’s going to take a good team to beat us.

An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

minister Simon Coveney said his focus remained on the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop insurance policy.On Tuesday, a European Commission spokesman suggested Britain exiting the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement in March may lead to the imposition of a hard frontier between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In the absence of the backstop and a Withdrawal Agreement we have a very dficult job to

dficult job to do to prevent border infrastructure, but of course that would have to be our focus.”The Irish Government has insisted for months that while it will prepare for a hard Brexit with the UK at the ports and airports, it will not put in place infrastructure to check goods or people at the land border with Northern Ireland.The backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement has been a central part of Dublin’s plan to avoid checks on the Irish border.Poland’s foreign minister has suggested a time-limited backstop.The Irish believe a time limit would mean it was not actually a backstop, designed to prevent a hard borderno better trade deal is hammered out between the UK and the EU.Mr Coveney told reporters in Dublin: “As the debate on the backstop in Westminster continues this week I think the focus should be on this issue, to ensure that we do have a credible legal mechanism and a regulatory mechanism to prevent border infrastructure.“That is called the backstop and many people seem to refer to the backstop as a political tool as opposed to a legal and regulatory mechanism to protect the important status quo on this island, which does not have any physical border infrastructure in the North.“Our focus remains on that, that is the solution, that is how we prevent this issue becoming a real problem.”Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas was asked whether the EU’s commitment to the Irish peace process would last whether or not there is a Brexit deal.He replied: “If you like to push me and speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario in Ireland, I think it’s pretty obvious, you will have a hard border.“Our commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and everything that we have been doing for years with our tools, instruments and programmes will have to take inevitably into account this fact.“So, of course, we are for peace, of course we stand behind the Good Friday Agreement, but that’s what a no-deal scenario would entail.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry families return to homes after hijacked vehicles cause security alerts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Likely to appeal to moderate MPs who just want #Brexit sorted.— andrew murrisonJanuary , Labour’s frontbench tabled its own amendment calling for a vote on the party’s plan for a customs union with

secretary Rebecca Long Bailey insisted it did not tie the party into backing a new vote “in any way”.Speaking in Brussels, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said there was “nothing new” in Mrs May’s statement to MPs on Monday, in which she promised to seek a means to keep the Irish border open in a way which can win the support of Parliament.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Asked whether the EU commitment to the peace process would last “whether or not there is a deal”, Mr Schinas told reporters: “If you like to push me and speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario

programmes will have to take inevitably into account this fact.“So, of course, we are for peace, of course we stand behind the Good Friday Agreement, but that’s what a no-deal scenario would entail.”Mr Schinas said the Withdrawal Agreement sealed between the UK and EU last November was not up for negotiation, and channelled the Spice Girls as he said: “We expect the United Kingdom to tell us what they want, what they really, really want.”Mr Coveney later said:  “In the absence of the backstop and a Withdrawal Agreement, we have a very dficult job to do to prevent border infrastructure, but of course that would have to be our focus.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Simon Coveney The Prime Minister has repeatedly promised the people of Northern Ireland that the Government would do “everything in our power” to avoid a hard border after Brexit, amid fears it could undermine the peace process.But in a TV interview earlier this month, she cautioned that this would require action to resolve issues arising from Brexit, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “No border doesn’t happen simply because people sit around saying, ‘well, we won’t have a border’.”She has faced fierce opposition from Conservative Eurosceptics and the Democratic Unionist Party, who fear the backstop could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union and force Northern Ireland to follow single market regulations.But former cabinet minister Damian Green, a close ally of Mrs May, said he had detected signs of opinion shting, telling BBC Radio ’s World At One: “People are now actively looking for a deal that they can support, rather than actively looking for reasons why they can’t support whatever has been put forward.”Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said it was “very concerning” that Mrs May had not removed the option of a no deal from the table.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mary Lou McDonald Speaking outside the Irish parliament in Dublin, she said: “As each day and as each week

Northern Ireland  Brexit went ahead without a deal.Speaking at a People’s Vote press conference in Westminster, Ms Lucas said: “The Government has not put , troops on stand-by to hand out plastic Union flags for everyone to wave at their no-deal Brexit street parties.“It’s put troops on stand-by to help deal with the potential collapse of law and order.”She said it was “unforgivable” for

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods.

As a result, Castle Park will have provision for a number of motorhomes which are welcome to park up overnight and enjoy what Newcastle has to offer.Cllr Devlin said the provision of the new spaces at both parks will be completed in advance of the new barriers being erected to ensure that there is no gap in provision.She thanked council officials involved in addressing the motorhome issue and is pleased local authority officials plan to speak with representatives from the motorhome community to see what more can be done for them.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThere is an acceptance that motorhomes contribute to the local economy and that needs to be encouraged and supported where possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Young Down side lift McGirk Cup  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS hurlers lted the McGurk Cup at The Dub in Belfast on Saturday night after an entertaining and close showdown that went to the wire.The university lads looked well beaten at one stage, but Simon Dohertyrsquos charges hit back from being - to - down, minutes into the second half to hit back and draw level at - to - as the game entered the final stages.However, it was Ronan Sheehanrsquos Down side who held their nerve and late, unanswered points from Paul Sheehan , PJ Davidson and Conor OrsquoPrey were enough to quell the studentsrsquo gallant challenge.Shea Shannon opened the scoring for the students with a point from play in the fth minute, but a sensational goal from way out on the right hand sideline from Cormac Coulter and a point from Tom Murray had Down - to - to the good.However, UU responded with three points of their own from Oisin McManus and James OrsquoConnellto draw level by the th minute.The sides then exchanged points before scores from Coulter and two Sheehan frees handed Down a - to - lead after  minutes.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcnally.jpg","title":"brexit immigration tips for employers","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business Due to the impact of Brexit, immigration law in the UK is set to substantially change. Facing this prospect, which key areas should employers be aware of, asks Philip McNally from KPMG Legal Services  Navigating the ongoing Brexit negotiations is a challenge, particularly for employers. Much is reliant on the make-up of any final deal but, armed with the right knowledge, there are some actions which both employers and employees can take now to make sure your business is prepared.  The rights of Irish British citizens: The most frequently asked question we encounter in KPMG’s immigration practice relates to the rights of Irish employees have to work in the UK, and British employees to work in the Republic of Ireland. Due to the impact of the Common Travel Area and associated rights and privileges, Irish citizens are not considered to be ‘foreign nationals’ in the UK, and British nationals are not considered to be ‘foreign’ in the Republic of Ireland. As a result, the right of Irish citizens to work in the UK, and of British nationals to work in the Republic, will not be impacted by Brexit.  The impact on recruitment If there is a transition period, employers will be able to recruit EU nationals , just as they do now, until December  . If there is no deal, it is unclear when “free movement of people” will end. However, it could end as early as March , .  The EU Settlement Scheme Under the EU Settlement Scheme, every EU national in the UK must make an application. The application will cost £ for each adult, and is due to open in March . This scheme is set to come into force whether or not a deal is concluded between the EU and UK.  Conduct an immigration audit In order to frame your immigration Brexit planning, we suggest that you conduct an initial audit of your workforce to gauge your exposure to Brexit. You should identy how many EU employees you have, their role and the location that they work in. Thereafter you can assess what you need to do to encourage and assist such employees to retain their right to work in the UK.  Make your plan Once you know your immigration exposure, you can plan your response. If you have a low percentage of EU Nationals working in your organisation, it may be sufficient to supply those workers with information about the EU Settlement Scheme, and hope that they make the application. However,you employ a high percentage of EU workers, we advise that you intervene and assist or get assistance for these workers to make the mandatory applications.  The post-Brexit immigration system Under the proposed post-Brexit immigration system , employers will face a number of challenges. These potentially include a minimum salary requirement of £, and the necessity for a work visa for EU nationals. As such, those employers who rely on low paid EU employees, are at risk of not only losing their EU workers but will struggle to recruit after  due to the post Brexit restrictions. Bearing that in mind,your organisation is affected in this manner, we advise that you retain your existing workforce by assisting them through the EU Settlement Scheme.  KPMG’s Corporate Immigration team is assisting employers and their workers in assessing their immigration status and supporting the relevant applications to minimise the effect of Brexit on the workforce.

According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.
