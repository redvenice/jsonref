Chloe Goins claimed she was assaulted by Crosby at the mansion, but criminal charges in this case were ruled out. It also had a reputation of being dirty after multiple former Playboy bunnies spoke out about the dilapidated building and floors strewn with dog feces and urine.In 2011, health officials confirmed that the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u0027 disease was found in a whirlpool spa at the Playboy Mansion where more than 100 people fell ill.The Los Angeles County Health Department presented its findings at an annual conference at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The legionella bacteria also causes a milder illness called Pontiac fever.Symptoms, which include fever and headache, are the same as those suffered by the Playboy Mansion partygoers. Hefner decided not to leave the mansion to his widow Crystal after his death but chose to sell it while he was still alive - with the condition he was allowed to stay there until his death. However he did leave her $5million and a 5,900 square foot house in Beverly Hills. Most of his fortune was split between his four children and various charities.Crystal, 31, was the third of his wives, having married him in 2012.He had previously been married to Mildred Williams from 1949-1959, with whom he had two children, and Kimberley Conrad - 1989\u0027s 27-year-old Playmate of the Year - from 1989-2010.Cooper, Hefner and Conrad\u0027s elder son, said that he and brother Marston grew up with a framed photo of his mom\u0027s nude centerfold in the home.\u0027Yeah, that was weird,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027It was like the elephant in the room.\u0027Hefner also had a bevvy of \u0027girlfriends\u0027 who lived with him - usually several at a time - at his famed Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles.Despite declaring that he had slept with more than a thousand women, Hefner spent much of his life \u0027looking for love in all the wrong places,\u0027 as he tearfully told The New York Times in 1992.Hefner married Crystal - and took up a life of monogamy - in 2012 after briefly calling off the engagement. \u0027Maybe I should be single,\u0027 he said a few months later.\u0027But I do know that I need an ongoing romantic relationship. In other words, I am essentially a very romantic person, and all I really was looking for, quite frankly, with the notion of marriage was continuity and something to let the girl know that I really cared.\u0027The year before their marriage, he had mused: \u0027I never really found my soulmate.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Booking com tells family five star holiday fell use hotel 250 miles away","story":"Share this articleFamily ‘in tears’ after Cornwall hotel booking swapped for Uxbridge | Consumer affairs | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Eco mob M25 AGAIN","story":"Share this article   A spokesman for the group said in a video released Monday that it wasn\u0027t \u0027scared\u0027 by the court intervention, adding that its members were \u0027prepared\u0027 to continue being arrested.The injunction was designed to act as a deterrent after weeks of blockades on both the M25 and A20 near Dover infuriated motorists and large portions of the British public.  But news that the eco-warriors are still being released without conditions, reported by LBC, raises fears that they will continue to wreak havoc and put drivers\u0027 lives at risk.It comes as spokesman for the group Liam Norton - who became a laughing stock last week when it was revealed his own home hadn\u0027t been insulated - warned in a video recorded at the weekend and released today: \u0027You can\u0027t scare us with these injunctions\u0027.Donning a black t-shirt and standing in front a bare white wall, he said: \u0027I\u0027m going to sit in the roads and directly oppose the injunction handed out by the Home Secretary and the Transport Secretary.\u0027Our message to the Government is that you can\u0027t scare us with these injunctions.\u0027You can send us to prison, and what that will show is the Government\u0027s cowardice, because they\u0027re actually standing up for powerful interests rather than looking after the interests of the vast majority of the British people.\u0027He added: \u0027We just want the Government to get on with the job of protecting the people\u0027s future in Britain and also to stop the needless deaths of thousands of our elderly who freeze to death in their homes each year because they have to make that awful decision between heating and eating.\u0027So our message to the Government is this You can decide to put us in prison, and we\u0027re prepared for that, but what would be better for the country maybe would be to give us a meaningful statement that you are going to get on with the job, so come on Boris, show some leadership, do what you need to do.\u0027 The Metropolitan Police told the Mail Online it could not comment on the breaking of the injunction because it was a \u0027civil issue\u0027. The Home Office has been contacted for comment. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf489112e9ba7c11595d8f03900c74e516a3cf39/0_0_5739_3443/master/5739.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2499e2071b03a8797a3b2762529bc108","title":"coronavirus live news new zealand cases jump sharply unvaccinated united airlines workers face termination","story":"The Zimbabwe government is now requiring its half a million employees to have the jab. The Associated Press reports that the strategy is worrying human rights groups. Critics say that, unlike in richer countries that have made use of mandates, Zimbabwe’s rollout isn’t up to the task. Vaccination centres sometimes run out of supply, and poor urban townships and rural areas have often been starved of doses in recent months. What’s more, they say, it’s cruel to put at risk the livelihoods of people who are some of the world’s most vulnerable and already suffering during the pandemic. “The Zimbabwe government should first focus on making sure that vaccines are equally available to all people without any obstacles before considering making them mandatory,” said Dewa Mavhinga, southern Africa director for Human Rights Watch. But the government, known for being authoritarian, appears ready to double down. It already requires vaccines at places of worship and has suggested extending the mandates to public buses — a critical mode of transportation for the country’s poor.  Those measures would effectively make the vaccine a requirement for the vast majority of Zimbabwean adults. Some have waited hours on end only to be told the vaccination center was closing early because of limited supplies or a lack of staff. People eligible for second shots have also complained of being turned away from centers giving preference to those seeking first doses.  Mutasa’s organization, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, is fighting mandates for workers in court, one of the only organizations in the country to be publicly opposed to them. Mandates will cause “carnage,” he said. Dr. Agnes Mahomva, the chief coordinator of the government’s COVID-19 response, defended mandates, saying they are aimed at “protecting everyone” and arguing they remain voluntary in a way. “If one doesn’t want to be vaccinated, no one is going to come to their house to grab them and vaccinate them,” she said.The Social Security Fund, which runs Costa Rica’s public hospital system, has since February required immunization against COVID-19 for all its workers. On Monday, the University of Costa Rica, the country’s biggest university, also announced a vaccination mandate. The health authorities did not outline the consequences for employees who refuse to take a vaccine, saying “it will be the employer’s responsibility to take measures according to the country’s legislation and institutional regulations”. Several European countries have begun lifting restrictions in recent days as vaccination rates rise, but economies are not expected to return to normal immediately. Spain has put in place provision for furlough payments to stay for several months.Factories in Vietnam are a major source of global clothing and other consumer goods but have been hit hard by restrictions on movement in the past 18 months. The AFP agency reports that in a fabric mill east of Hanoi, Claudia Anselmi – the Italian director of Hung Yen Knitting \u0026amp Dyeing, a key cog in the supply chain of several European and US clothing giants – worries daily if the factory can keep the lights on. “At first we were lacking people (to work) because everyone was stuck at home,” said Anselmi, whose company’s fabric is later used in swimwear and sportswear for customers including Nike, Adidas and Gap. Now, “travel restrictions have jeopardised all logistics in and out … this has created long, long delays,” she told AFP. “We only survive if we have the stock.” While lockdowns are gradually loosening across the country as infections steadily decline, millions of Vietnamese have been under stay-at-home orders for months. A complex web of checkpoints and confusing travel permit regulations have made life impossible for truck drivers and businesses trying to move goods across, as well and in and out of, the country.  The delays and restrictions are a major headache for foreign businesses, many of which have pivoted to south-east Asia from China in recent years. The sports colossus sources about half of its footwear from the communist country. Although some factories were able to set up a system where staff could eat, work and sleep on site to get around lockdown restrictions, Vitas said that the cost was prohibitive for many. Japan’s Fast retailing, which owns the popular Uniqlo brand, also blamed the situation in Vietnam for hold-ups on sweaters, sweatpants, hoodies and dresses, while Adidas said supply chain issues – including in the country – could cost it as much as €500m ($585m) in sales by the end of the year. Even with the prospect of lockdowns easing, many are fretting over the long-term impact on Vietnamese manufacturing, with Nike and Adidas admitting they were looking to temporarily produce elsewhere. Nguyen Thi Anh Tuyet, deputy general director of Maxport Vietnam, whose 6,000 workers churn out activewear for the likes of Lululemon, Asics and Nike, told AFP the firm had “been very worried” about clients withdrawing orders - even though it was one of the lucky few to have navigated recent brutal months largely unscathed. Without foreign customers “our workers would become jobless”, she said.The restrictions include having to eat separately from vaccinated players.  ESPN said that, as per the NBA’s health and safety protocols released to teams on Tuesday, vaccinated players will only be tested if they show symptoms or are a close contact of a positive case. But unvaccinated players will have to undergo daily testing prior to entering a team facility, participating in team-organised activities, or interacting with other players and coaches. Unvaccinated players will not be allowed to dine in the same room as other players, and must be given a locker as distant as possible from other players. Unvaccinated players will also have to remain at their residence, or the team hotel during road trips, outside game time except for team and essential activities such as taking children to school or buying groceries. They will also have to quarantine for seven days if they are a close contact while vaccinated players will only have to do so in “unusual circumstances”. The report said face masks were mandatory for all players for the 2021-22 season, which starts on 19 October. Four-time NBA champion LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers said he was initially “very sceptical” about the vaccine but decided to take it after doing his research. “I don’t talk about other people and what they should do,” James said. “I don’t think I personally should get involved in what other people do for their bodies and livelihoods. “I know that I was very sceptical about it but after doing my own research I felt like it was best suited for me and my family and my friends.”The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said earlier this month it would look to complete its data review for this age group as quickly as possible, likely in a matter of weeks rather than months. That could mean an authorization of the shot for children by the end of October, sources have told Reuters. The vaccine, which is already authorised for 12 to 15-year- olds and fully approved for ages 16 and up, induced a strong immune response in the target age group in a 2,268-participant clinical trial, the companies said earlier this month. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized for the 12-15 age group roughly a month after the companies filed for authorisation. If the same timeline is followed for this application, younger children could start receiving their shots as soon as late October.“It is obvious that the number of contaminations has increased since the start of the pandemic”, Alina Schiau from the Romanian anti-Aids Association told AFP. As coronavirus took hold, hospitals closed to non-Covid patients, says Davron Mukhamadiev, regional health and care coordinator for Red Cross Europe (IFRC). Quarantine requirements, travel restrictions and reduced access to rapid testing and diagnostic services all undermined efforts to roll back HIVAids, he said. UNAids data shows 140,000 new infections in eastern Europe and central Asia in 2020, compared with 170,000 in 2019, which experts attribute to a dramatic slowdown in screening, not a drop in cases. In 2020, for example, Romania managed to screen only 234,420 people for HIVAids – down nearly a third from 334,410 the previous year. It is a similar story in neighbouring Bulgaria. Regional health centres were “overwhelmed and hardly ever did any HIV testing during Covid”, said Alexander Milanov, programme director at the country’s National Patients’ Organisation. The pandemic has disrupted supply chains and the transport of medicines, exacerbating historic shortages in countries such as Romania despite huge scientific strides that have dramatically improved outcomes for HIV patients in rich nations. The HIVAIDS crisis in Romania dates back to the communist years. About 11,000 children born in the 1980s under the communist regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu were infected as a result of contaminated or unsterilised syringes or transfusions with untested blood. Romania’s health ministry did not respond to an AFP request for a comment.The 12-week “Apollo trial”, run by the University of East Anglia, will treat people who have experienced smell loss or an altered sense of smell as a result of viral infections with nasal drops containing the vitamin, the University of East Anglia (UEA) said in a statement. The university said research from Germany had shown the potential benefit of the vitamin, and its team “will explore how this treatment works to help repair tissues in the nose damaged by viruses”. The researchers hope the study “could one day help improve the lives of millions around the world who suffer from smell loss, by returning their fifth sense”. It comes after a study by an international group of smell experts, published in the journal International Forum of Allergy \u0026amp Rhinology in April, advised against using steroids to treat smell loss and instead suggested “smell training”. Prof Carl Philpott from the UEA’s Norwich Medical School said the method “aims to help recovery based on neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to reorganise itself to compensate for a change or injury”.But the bacteria are swiftly evolving to survive those chemical attacks – and as they survive, they become virulent superbugs. Without new antibiotics, by 2050 the death toll from drug-resistant infections is projected to reach 10 million people a year, making the coronavirus pandemic seem almost quaint.  This is why scientists at Plymouth University have been searching the cold, dark abyss of the north Atlantic – where they have found sponges that contain powerful molecules capable of killing those superbugs. Kerry Howell, professor of deep-sea ecology, and her colleagues have been carefully collecting specimens of these plant-like animals, bringing them back to the lab and testing pulverised extracts against stubborn, disease-causing bacteria. Among the deep-sea molecules, they are finding promising bactericidal novelties: Amid mounting concern over staff shortages and supplies across the economy, ministers said the group of executives would help to identify and oversee actions that the government could take to smooth the post-pandemic recovery for pubs, hotels, cafes and restaurants. Meeting for the first time on Wednesday, the council will include industry leaders from 22 hospitality firms and trade bodies, including UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, Burger King, and Deliveroo. It comes as venues continue to be hampered by lower levels of footfall in town and city centres despite the easing of most pandemic restrictions, delivery disruptions, a lack of available workers, and rising costs: In early August, the company became the first US carrier to require Covid vaccinations for all domestic employees, requiring proof of vaccination by Monday. The carrier said it would start on Tuesday the process of firing 593 employees who decided not to get vaccinated. “This was an incredibly difficult decision but keeping our team safe has always been our first priority,” chief executive Scott Kirby and president Brett Hart told employees in a memo. “This is a big number. It’s a sobering number. I don’t think anybody who’s involved in this process would be celebrating a number like the one we’re seeing today,” said the Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins. “But the fact that such a significant proportion of those are known contacts or household contacts does point a little bit to the nature of this particular outbreak that we’re now dealing with in the way it’s concentrated in larger households.” The director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said a number of the cases had been expected by health officials – much of Auckland’s outbreak is spreading through large family groups. Thirty-three of the new cases were known household or close contacts of existing cases. Of these, 26 were household contacts, and 12 came from two households. Twelve cases were unlinked. Tess McClure reports from Christchurch with Eva Corlett in Wellington: New Zealand’s daily Covid cases jumped sharply to 45 on Wednesday – more than five times the previous day’s number. The rise comes after several days of about 12 cases a day, and around a week after the Auckland region lifted its strictest lockdown restrictions. Meanwhile in the America, United Airlines said on Tuesday nearly 600 US-based employees faced termination after failing to comply with the carrier’s vaccination policy. In early August, the company became the first US carrier to require Covid vaccinations for all domestic employees, requiring proof of vaccination by Monday. More on these stories shortly.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIreland has been named the best country to be in as the world learns to live through the coronavirus pandemic, topping the latest Bloomberg Covid Resilience Ranking.In its monthly report published on Tuesday the news agency noted Ireland had been “steadily climbing” the rankings since the beginning of the year when it had experienced the worst outbreak in the world. It noted a “startling turnaround” and national vaccination rates among the highest globally. Ireland took the top position from Norway, while European countries remain dominant in the higher rankings.“Even as the peak summer travel season unfolded alongside delta’s spread, Ireland and places like Spain, the Netherlands and Finland held down serious illness and deaths through pioneering moves to largely limit quarantine-free entry to immunised people,” the report said.“Bestowing more domestic freedoms on the inoculated helped boost vaccination levels to some of the highest in the world - over 90 per cent of Ireland’s adult population has received two shots - while allowing social activity to resume safely.”Responding in a social media post, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the result was down to the hard work of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Irish public. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the same resilience would see Ireland on a safe path to recovery coming into the autumn. “Time and again you did the right thing. You listened to us and worked with us on Covid restrictions and coming forward for your vaccine,” he said on Twitter. HSE chief executive Paul Reid noted “really tough times” met by a coherent and cohesive response. The top spot may be seen as something of a boon to a population fatigued by ongoing Covid-19 restrictions and a pandemic that has upended normal life. As politicians and health officials welcomed the result on Tuesday, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) reported a further 1,499 cases of the virus in the State. As of early morning, 300 people were being treated in hospital, 63 of whom were in intensive care units. Bloomberg described its ranking system as a monthly snapshot of where it is being handled the most effectively, with the least social and economic upheaval. Results across 53 economies are based on 12 indicators including virus containment, quality of healthcare, vaccination coverage, overall mortality and progress toward restarting travel.The top five ranked countries are Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark. There are also negative findings. The delta variant has left the US “reeling”, it found, with the world’s largest economy dropping three spaces to 28 during September “as unfettered normalisation, regardless of vaccination status” drove new cases aggressively upward. Southeast Asian economies continue to fare the worst with Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines in the bottom five positions. And while once the “gold standard” for virus containment, the Asia-Pacific region has been found faltering in the era of vaccination. Ireland may be buoyed by the latest results but Bloomberg’s data also comes with warnings for the future. “What’s increasingly apparent is that the pandemic is far from over-for some more than others,” it said, in reference to vaccine inequality. “With so many countries barely inoculated, the risk of another destructive variant emerging has never been higher.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers demand to be included in covid 19 bonus payments","story":"Teachers’ contribution to remote teaching and keeping schools open has been of crucial importance in meeting young people’s needs, said the unions. Photograph: Getty ImagesTeachers should get proposed Covid-19 bonus payments for frontline workers because of their “extraordinary efforts” during the pandemic, teaching unions have declared.The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI), Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) and the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) came together in a joint statement to demand the extra money.While there have been no formal discussions, the three said the contribution to remote teaching and keeping schools open has been of crucial importance in meeting young people’s needs.“We would expect to be included in any discussions around the acknowledgement of workers’ contributions during the pandemic,” they said, though no formal talks have taken place with the Government.“Teachers’ extraordinary efforts – both face-to-face with their pupils in crowded classrooms and in the online learning space – have allowed schools to continue to prioritise teaching and learning while meeting childrenyoung people’s needs,” they said.UnequalTUI general secretary Michael Gillespie suggested that one option could include “getting rid of unequal payscales”, which has seen teachers hired since 2011 earn less than older colleagues.Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath has warned that the bonus could cost €1 billion, while the bid by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and other health unions for 10 days’ extra leave brings “significant costs”.Meanwhile, gardaí have equally insisted that they should receive bonus payments, partly arguing that the drop in crime that took place during the pandemic because people were not out is not a reason to leave them out.The Garda Representative Association (GRA) and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (Agsi) have so far not raised the issue in talks with the Government.ProudHowever, a GRA source said gardaí should receive “no more and no less” than other State workers, adding that the fact that most forms of crime dropped significantly during the pandemic is a reason for gardaí to be proud.Meanwhile, domestic violence increased, while gardaí had to deal with a raft of new, speedily introduced laws, the GRA source told The , speaking anonymously.“The fact that crime figures are down is something for gardaí to be proud of. And certainly, there have been other issues regarding the rise in domestic violence because of the pandemic,” he said.Gardaí had to adapt to 12-hour rosters during the pandemic, which cut overtime . The roster is coming to an end shortly and gardaí are eager to get certainty on what will replace it, he added.An Agsi source rejected any claims that gardaí had less work to do during Covid-19 due to the drop in crime, pointing to the efforts made for vulnerable people and at checkpoints “at considerable risk to themselves at times”.Meanwhile, drugs and organised crime operations continued unabated, with unprecedented seizures. “Those people were happy to do it,” they said. “No one is looking for special treatment.

Photograph: Alan BetsonMinister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has said it is “understandable” that mica homeowner representatives on the Government working group might not sign off on the redress report today.The working group was set up this summer to examine the issue of redress following significant pressure on the Government and it comprises officials from the Department of Housing and representatives of affected homeowners.Despite their membership on the group, the representatives say they have not received a copy of the final report on redress.Eileen Doherty, campaigners’ representative and group member, warned that they may not sign off on it given the delays. She said multiple requests have been made to see the report.Speaking on Wednesday morning, Mr O’Brien said the Government could offer extra time to examine the report.“Let’s not underestimate the work that has gone in by the residents and indeed by my officials and officials from the housing agency as well. I would hope to get that report today, and if not today certainly tomorrow. They are working through it, they have been working with officials, we have had numerous meetings with them and as soon as I get the report I would expect we would be able give a presentation on that report today.”On RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr O’Brien was asked about the campaigners’ statement that they may sign off on the report until they have seen it.He said: “well absolutely, that is understandable. Whilst this is very important and urgent timewise we want to get it right. So if it requires an extra couple of days to give people a chance to go through and look at it that will absolutely be fine.”Mr O’Brien said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to the mica redress scheme. He said he was “absolutely committed” to improving the scheme. “I know how important this is. I want to help. This is a serious process.”Any scheme would “more than likely” require legislation, he added.Mr O’Brien also said that the scheme was likely to require expansion and require the Housing Agency to handle it more efficiently, along with local authorities.The scheme could cost taxpayers €1.5 billion. “That can’t be ignored,” said Mr O’Brien.The Minister will meet the working group today and expects to bring a report to Cabinet as early as next week. He said he would brief the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan on Thursday.“This is my number one priority.”When asked if banks should be involved in the compensation scheme, Mr O’Brien said he expected various stakeholders to be involved and he had asked the Attorney General to examine what legal recourse the State had. But he believed that those directly responsible – the building sector, quarries and others have to make contributions.There was no need for anyone else to pay into the compensation fund at this stage, the Government would do that, but he would be looking at other mechanisms. He acknowledged that others “may contribute” once legal recourse had been taken with those responsible.Later on the same programme Brian Hayes of the Banking \u0026amp Payments Federation said the responsibility for the mica problem did not lie with banks. Banks had provided what assistance they could such as payment breaks, credit lines etc. “The question is who is responsible for this? Where does culpability lie?”"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord sinn f%C3%A9in s good standard of heckling doesn t stand up to scrutiny","story":"Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin reminded the Government of past efforts on housing solutions, unveiled with similar fanfare by Simon Coveney and Eoghan Murphy. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins“Don’t be tempting me now,” threatened the Taoiseach, as a tantalising thought was planted in his head by the Independent TD for Clare.Although it’s not like the idea hasn’t crossed Micheál Martin’s mind already. What if … what if something came up, something completely unforeseen, something of such enormous magnitude it completely upended the Merrion Street succession agreement?What then? Obviously he would have no choice but to stay on in the top job until things settled down again.It was Michael McNamara who painted this scenario during Leaders’ Questions while raising the situation of craft apprentices due to serve their time in four years but now facing a two-year wait before they can finish their training.He said that 3,500 apprenticeships had been delayed because of backlogs caused by Covid. Given the housing crisis and the pressing need for constructions workers across the country, qualified tradespeople are sorely needed now.Medical students and others in university “are not being told that instead of your four-year degree, it is now going to take six”, McNamara said.The Government should “do whatever it takes” to make sure apprentices “get the training they signed up for in full and on time so that they can enter the workforce.”The Taoiseach was full of praise for the baby plumbers, chippies and sparks. Armed with an impressive array of facts and figures, he held forth on capital investment, increasing capacity, on- and off-the-job training, cutting waiting lists, course restructuring, blended learning and Covid-19.“It is a very pertinent question that goes to heart of the challenges that face us in terms of Housing for All,” Martin said. He forgot to say “unprecedented” but more than made up for that later when the housing plan was discussed.Thanks for all that information, said McNamara, but his one, simple question remained unanswered: will these apprentices finish on schedule? They’ve made plans for entering the world of work, such as looking into buying vans and maybe even buying a house.“I suppose, if I could draw an analogy ... ” continued the barrister from Scarriff, endeavouring to assist the Taoiseach “... your Government is a slightly unusual relationship in that Leo Varadkar is supposed to be the taoiseach again in December 2022. Now, if you turned around to him and said, ‘Well, sure there’s been a lot of difficulties over Covid. Actually you’re not going to be Taoiseach for another year at least … ”Over the oceanMicheál didn’t demur. One couldn’t blame him, with Leo an ocean away in Washington and still leeching his limelight with heavy hints about the budget. Again.Breaking such news to his Tánaiste wouldn’t bode well for the stability of his Government, suggested McNamara. So he might reflect on that and how it must feel like for apprentices who have also made life plans and want to know they are running to schedule.Micheál smiled. “Don’t tempt me now!”Chance would be a fine thing.The state of the housing market and the Housing for All plan took up much of Tuesday’s business. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald set her party’s tone for the day when pouring scorn on the Minister for Housing’s recent assertion that the property market was not out of control and the Tánaiste’s remark last week that “one person’s rent is another person’s income”.Could the Taoiseach enlighten her? “What planet are these men living on?”Not to mentioned Darragh “your man, your Housing Minister” O’Brien’s new plan, which was “clueless and out of touch”.In support of his man, Micheál managed an unprecedented number of unprecedenteds.“The Minister has produced Housing for All, an unprecedented, comprehensive strategy backed, in an unprecedented way, by resources to make a far greater number of houses available to enable people to buy houses and afford them,” he said. “What has been announced in Housing for All is unprecedented. The investment is unprecedented.”Statements on O’Brien’s unprecedented plan were taken later in the day – to be continued on Wednesday. The exchanges followed a familiar pattern.“I have to say I’ve terrible sense of deja vu,” said Eoin Ó Broin at the outset of his response to the Minister’s speech outlining the merits of his big initiative.Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman reminded the Government of past efforts, unveiled with similar fanfare by Simon Coveney and Eoghan Murphy.Which was very true, but that sense of deja vu went further than a pile of abandoned Government solutions.Another dimensionAlso wearyingly familiar was Sinn Féin’s response to the wide-reaching Housing for All proposals, along with the repetition of the stock “what planet are you on?” reactions.“Do you live in the real world at all, Minister. Do you really?” asked Louise O’Reilly (Dublin Fingal). “What planet are you actually living on?” asked Sorca Clarke (Longford-Westmeath).Kildare TD Réada Cronin took the out-of-this-world line to new heights and said the housing plan was taking people “on a spin on a magic carpet, only there’s a massive hole in it”.The Government hit back. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill held up Sinn Féin’s housing policy. “Rubbish” she scoffed. “There are two more, but don’t go looking for any detail.”Richard Bruton, echoing points made by colleagues from all three Coalition parties, attacked the party on its routine of building a caricature and then attacking it.The latest caricature, he said, was that the Government housing plan was about private developers. “To try to portray it as some type of attempt to get into cahoots with private developers, to hoodwink people, is simply not the case”.Green Party TD Steven Matthews complimented Sinn Féin’s good standard of heckling, “but even the heckling doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.”Darragh O’Brien put up a spirited defence of the plan, outlining its broad reach in detail and his belief it will transform the housing system.“In reality we must use every weapon we have … There is no silver bullet and I can’t tell you it will be fixed overnight,” he stressed, before looking across the chamber at Ó Broin.“We can’t let one party’s perfect be the enemy of the common good. The Opposition needs to show what it is offering beyond soundbites, hypocrisy and ideological dead-ends.”People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett was hankering after Berlin, where the people have voted for significant rent controls. “They said expropriate landlords. Expropriate!”But what do we do here when faced with vulture funds controlling large swathes of housing? “We pay for it, they run away with the profits and tenants are screwed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"o brien faces difficult decision as pressure from mica group mounts","story":"Members of north Mayo Pyrite Group and MAG Mica Action Group Donegal protesting outside the Dáil.

Photograph: EPAJapan’s former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, won the governing party leadership election on Wednesday and is set to become the next prime minister.He faces the imminent task of addressing a pandemic-hit economy and ensuring a strong alliance with Washington to counter growing regional security risks.Mr Kishida replaces outgoing party leader, prime minister Yoshihide Suga, who is stepping down after serving only one year since taking office last September.As new leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Mr Kishida is certain to be elected the next prime minister on Monday in parliament, where his party and coalition partner control the house.Mr Kishida beat popular vaccinations minister Taro Kono in a runoff after finishing only one vote ahead of him in the first round where none of the four candidates, including two women, was able to win a majority.Results showed Mr Kishida had more support from party heavyweights who apparently chose stability over change advocated by Kono, who is known as something of a maverick.The new leader is under pressure to change the party’s high-handed reputation worsened by Mr Suga, who angered the public over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and insistence on holding the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The long-ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party desperately needs to quickly turn around plunging public support ahead of lower house elections coming within two months.Mr Kishida called for growth and distribution under his “new capitalism”, saying that the economy under Japan’s longest-serving prime minister Shinzo Abe had only benefited big companies.Overall, little change is expected in key diplomatic and security policies under the new leader, said Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo.All of the candidates support close Japan-US security ties and partnerships with other like-minded democracies in Asia and Europe, in part to counter China’s growing influence and a threat from nuclear-armed North Korea.Wednesday’s vote was seen as a test of whether the party can move out of Mr Abe’s shadow. His influence in government and party affairs has largely muzzled erse views and shifted the party to the right.Mr Kishida is also seen as a choice who could prolong an era of unusual political stability amid fears that Japan could return to “revolving door” leadership.“Concern is not about iniduals but stability of Japanese politics,” said Michael Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, ahead of the vote.“It’s about whether or not we are entering a period in Japanese politics of instability and short-term prime ministership,” he said. “It makes it very hard to move forward on agenda.”Mr Suga is leaving only a year after taking office as a stand-in for Abe, who suddenly resigned over health problems, ending his nearly eight-year leadership, the longest in Japan’s constitutional history. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"macron remains committed to the goal of building european sovereignty","story":" Emmanuel Macron: more than half the 60 proposals made by the French president  in his Sorbonne speech in 2017 have been realised. Photograph:  Ludovic MarinEPAFour years ago this week, French president Emmanuel Macron delivered what may have been his most important address a 100-minute speech to students at the Sorbonne entitled “Initiative for Europe”.“Europe alone can ensure true sovereignty, that is to say our capacity to exist in today’s world and to defend our values and interests,” Macron said. “There is a European sovereignty to be built, and a necessity to build it.”Macron flew the EU’s blue and gold flag at his campaign rallies. On the night of his election, he walked across the courtyard of the Louvre while the European anthem played.As he now shifts into re-election campaign mode, he can boast of having given the EU new impetus, and of having changed French attitudes. No French political party, not even Marine Le Pen’s far right Rassemblement National, now advocates leaving the Union.Michel Barnier, a conservative presidential candidate who twice served as EU commissioner, and whose handling of Brexit negotiations was widely praised, might have rivalled Macron’s European credentials. But Barnier stunned Europhiles earlier this month by proposing that France be exempted from the rulings of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.The Sorbonne speech was “the spinal column” of France’s EU policy, an adviser to Macron said.“It seems to us that, after four years, Europe has profoundly changed and its software has changed in the direction proposed by the president of the Republic, that is to say towards building European sovereignty.”Macron’s photograph appears on six of the eight pages of the glossy brochure issued by the Élysée to mark the anniversary of the Sorbonne speech.More than half the 60 proposals made by Macron in 2017 have been realised, the adviser said. Only five or six have gone nowhere.The calamitous US withdrawal from Afghanistan has strengthened Macron’s initiative to create a rapid reaction force. EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen says the three main hurdles are poor intelligence co-operation, incompatible weapons systems, and weaknesses in cyber defence.The EU approved just such a force – the EU Battlegroup – at the Helsinki summit in 1999. It became operational in 2007, but was never activated, not even to evacuate EU citizens from Kabul, because its deployment would require a unanimous decision.Macron’s intervention force would raise the Battlegroup number from 1,500 to 5,000. The 13 participating member states are analysing the reasons for the Battlegroup’s failure, the adviser to Macron said.Three prioritiesIn his Sorbonne speech, Macron said “terrorist propaganda” must be removed from the internet. Recent EU legislation requires “terrorist” content to be taken down within an hour. Macron made similar proposals with Theresa May and Jacinda Ardern after extremist attacks in Britain and New Zealand.The European civil protection force proposed by Macron became operational in 2019 and was mobilised against forest fires in Greece this year, and in Croatia following an earthquake in December 2020.The Élysée refers to the French presidency of the EU by the acronym “PFEU”. It will start on January 1st, 2022, and will overlap with Macron’s re-election campaign. Analysts say Macron has only the three “useful” months of January, February and March to fulfil his European goals before the election in April. If he loses, his successor will complete the French EU presidency.Macron has set three priorities. As part of his drive for a “social Europe”, he wants a Europe-wide minimum wage, as foreseen in the Sorbonne speech. He abandoned plans for a national carbon tax when a hike on diesel fuel sparked the yellow-vest protests. Now he wants a carbon tax at Europe’s borders, which would penalise the EU’s trading partners for greenhouse emissions in their countries. He also wants to regulate the internet giants.With Angela Merkel’s departure, Macron becomes the most powerful man in Europe. Despite Ireland’s status as the most pro-EU member state, and despite excellent relations with Paris, Dublin could face some tough decisions soon. Ireland will come under increasing pressure to endorse the international agreement on a minimum corporate tax rate. Macron tried to achieve agreement within the EU, then shifted to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development when he was blocked by Ireland and other countries.The ill-feeling created in France and elsewhere in the EU by the formation of the Aukus defence alliance between Australia, the UK and US could stretch Ireland’s loyalties between the Anglosphere and its sense of European belonging.Many of Macron’s economic proposals run counter to Ireland’s vision of itself as a small economy open to the global market. And one wonders how long Ireland and five other neutral or non-aligned EU countries can resist Macron’s push for a “Europe of defence”. At Macron’s behest, the EU has for the first time established an € 8 billion defence budget.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron has waved flag gastronomic surrender","story":"No, it was poor, beleaguered President Macron. He was in Lyon and, with an eye on next year’s presidential election, was addressing the International Catering, Hotel and Food Trade Fair. Macron wants to galvanise chefs and others in the French hospitality industry, to make them feel proprietorial and patriotic about French cuisine, and in doing so win some votes.But beneath the rhetoric has Macron admitted something that many have long suspected? By announcing the creation of a new epicurean “centre of excellence” is he not letting slip a fact that terrifies so many in France – namely that their country is no longer the culinary champion of the world?After all, if a nation is truly great at something, it hardly needs to launch an academy to teach people how to do it. Macron’s speech was the white flag of gastronomic surrender, an admission that France’s chefs, ingredients, traditions and tastes have been overtaken.This defeat has been a long time coming. Over the past few decades, the country’s food traditions have been attacked and usurped on all sides. There’s been the advance in interest in all things Asian – think China, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, India.It is from this huge region that young cheffing talent gets much inspiration and ingredients far from putting jus, confits or cream sauces on their menus, the buzz has been for dumplings, spices, kimchi, wasabi, and fermented pastes such as gochujang or sashimi.Then there is the invasive beast of the supermarket. Pity the poor provincial French market trader selling his local and seasonal produce in the centre of a little town knowing that there’s a Lidl or Aldi offering ample parking, 24-hour convenience and pizza a couple of miles away. Not to mention the fact that even French supermarkets such as Carrefour and Monoprix these days offer a shopping experience that is more American than traditionally Gallic.Traditional France has also been left behind in some of the seismic food trends of recent years. As anyone who has ever visited an iconic French restaurant will know, vegetables are featured only as a decorative excuse on the plate a tiny slice of carrot at the outer reaches of your hare à la Royale. The plant-based revolution has left that for dust … and when the Bordeaux-based vegan restaurant ONA won a Michelin star earlier this year you could almost hear the sacré bleu uttered by the French culinary establishment.Since the 1970s, food has been democratised. Eating out is an everyday habit. And across the Channel the Brits have made a virtue of this: London, for example, has a far greater variety of cuisine at all prices than Paris – and that appeals to the modern diner.Macron’s attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted may be valiant – but he may yet find that the French culinary establishment don’t want him to “apprendre à un vieux singe à faire des grimaces”, as they’d say in a bouchon in Lyon.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Keir Starmer will not make same mistakes as Corbyn, says shadow minister ahead of keynote speech  Insulate Britain protest blocks the M25 for seventh timeFormer Australian PM attacks Aukus deal: \u0026#39France believes it has been deceived and humiliated, and she was\u0026#39Sarah Everard: Former Met officer Wayne Couzens to be sentenced for murderWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"familiar slogans starmers team","story":"The resignation of a Corbynite MP from the shadow cabinet indicates that Sir Keir Starmer’s efforts to break the hard Left’s grip on the party are more than superficial. Andy McDonald, the employment spokesman, ostensibly quit over a disagreement about the minimum wage but his departure appears to have been orchestrated to undermine the party leader.Mr McDonald accused Sir Keir of reneging on promises made during his leadership campaign, a view shared by other leading Left-wingers including Mr Corbyn and John McDonnell. They will be even more disconcerted by the leadership’s latest policy initiative – a reprise of one of the more successful slogans of the Blair era, “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.”The deliberate invocation of a New Labour mantra seems designed to signal that Sir Keir is moving the party to the centre and focusing on issues that matter to voters. Mr Blair managed to reverse Labour’s reputation as the party of victimhood by ushering in one of the toughest criminal justice crackdowns of recent times overseen by a succession of no-nonsense home secretaries like David Blunkett and John Reid.Harsher sentences saw prison numbers soar while anti-social behaviour measures were introduced to deal with low-level disorder on the streets. Although crime fell during the lockdowns, Labour spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds said it will increase unless action is taken. He proposed putting more police officers back on the beat, if only to show that in politics there is nothing new under the Sun. The police themselves recognise they have a job rebuilding relations after the pandemic. Sir David Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands, told a conference that “quick law” leading to the enforcement of Covid rules during lockdowns had harmed “police legitimacy”.Mr Thomas-Symonds said the 2019 election defeat demonstrated a loss of trust in Labour on the part of many of its traditional voters wary of Mr Corbyn and his Left-wing backers. The shadow home secretary also committed a future Labour government to removing failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals from the UK, a policy easier to promise than deliver.Nonetheless, the Blairite flag has been hoisted once more over the Labour party.

Others, including agents whose cover has been blown in the past, work under their real names.They will not, it must be said, be allowed to do any actual spying for their clients, but many of them can be seconded to workplaces to solve problems, advise on security threats or even help authors bring authenticity to spy novels.Francis Jago, Spyex marketing director, said: “They can distil tens of billions of dollars’ worth of government training and development and pass on the benefit of that to clients.“They all have different skills, but if you want to get better at recruiting people and motivating them, for example, you can hire an intelligence officer who has spent their career recruiting agents in the field.”Among the international roster of intelligence workers on Spyex’s books is CIA analyst Gina Bennett, whose work tracking down Osama bin Laden helped inspire Jessica Chastain’s character in the Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty.It was Ms Bennett, a 55-year-old mother of five, who first alerted the CIA to the threat from bin Laden and his movement in the early 1990s, before it became known as al-Qaeda, and she stayed on the case until bin Laden was hunted down and killed in Pakistan in 2011.She told The : “I really enjoy problem solving. I’m a visual thinker and I will often draw a problem to understand it before I try to find a solution. I will tend to look at a problem and come at it in a different way from the person I am working with, and these are not classified techniques.“I already teach ethics courses at Georgetown University. I love showing how you can de-escalate conflict in a mutually respectful way, and that works in business as well as in government.”Ms Bennett, who will retire from the CIA in May, already has permission to do external work as long as the CIA knows about it (even her conversation with The  required prior clearance).She says one of the lessons she can pass on is that while many people see spies as superhuman beings, “we are not stoic machines, we have the same problems as the next person. We are not James Bond and we struggle with the sort of things everyone struggles with.” Or, as Mr Jago puts it: “We believe really fervently that there are superheroes trapped inside most of us, and that with the right training and experience we can shine.”Spyex was the brainchild of Lisa Paul, an events manager, who launched a podcast about spying and got to know some of the intelligence workers who are now on Spyex’s books. Each of them was recruited through personal recommendations by fellow spies, and all operate within the constraints of the Official Secrets Act or their national equivalent.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Keir Starmer will not make same mistakes as Corbyn, says shadow minister ahead of keynote speech  Insulate Britain protest blocks the M25 for seventh timeFormer Australian PM attacks Aukus deal: \u0026#39France believes it has been deceived and humiliated, and she was\u0026#39Sarah Everard: Former Met officer Wayne Couzens to be sentenced for murderWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"raf lancaster bomber hero 97 finally receives medal","story":"An RAF veteran who flew the last Lancaster back to Britain during the Second World War has finally been awarded his medal, eight years after he became eligible for one.Former Squadron Leader Ken Symonds, 97, lost an engine during the final raid of Bomber Command\u0027s Europe offensive above Berchestgaden in the Bavarian Alps, where Adolf Hitler holidayed in his Eagles Nest retreat.Damage caused to Sq Ldr Symonds’s plane meant his was the last to return to RAF Syerston following the sortie on April 25, 1945.Veterans who served with Bomber Command were only entitled to a clasp in 2013 in recognition of their bravery and sacrifice after being overlooked for decades because of the number of civilian casualties.But Sq Ldr Symonds, from Martinstown, near Dorchester, Dorset, did not receive his clasp at the time.It was only when his neighbour Deborah Follett took him to the Imperial War Museum Duxford for his birthday in July that it was noticed he didn\u0027t have the clasp on his medals.Ms Follett applied to the MoD on Sq Ldr Symonds’ behalf, only to be told it would take months to process. So she contacted their local MP, who also lobbied the MoD, and the clasp arrived days later.Now the veteran has been presented with the clasp to go with his Air Force Cross and his other war medals.The widower said: “I am very pleased to have it and am only sorry that I missed out on it first time around. It is extremely important to me to get this.”Ms Follett, who is also Sq Ldr Symonds’ voluntary carer, said she didn’t know why he did not receive the honour in 2013.Chris Loder, Conservative MP for West Dorset, said: “This was a small but significant gesture of thanks to one of the last surviving members of our greatest generation, to whom we all owe so much.”Sq Ldr Symonds served in 49 Squadron and flew on seven bombing runs over Germany towards the end of the war.On May 4, 1945, he flew British PoWs home from Europe and then piloted his Lancaster over Buckingham Palace on VE Day four days later. He remained in the RAF and saw service in North Africa, Italy, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, US and Vietnam.Bomber Command suffered the highest casualty rate of the British Armed Forces in the Second World War, losing 55,573 of the 125,000 who served.

Everyone in policing feels betrayed.The police watchdog has received a string of referrals relating to the Couzens case, with 12 police officers being investigated.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was looking at whether the Met failed to investigate two allegations of indecent exposure relating to Couzens in February, just days before the killing.Kent Police are also being investigated over their response to a third allegation of indecent exposure dating back to 2015.The case has prompted renewed concern about police recruitment checks and why Couzens continued to hold a warrant card, despite the allegations of sexual offences.Scotland Yard has said there was no information available at the time that would have altered the vetting decision in his case.Politics latest news: Keir Starmer will not make same mistakes as Corbyn, says shadow minister ahead of keynote speech  Insulate Britain protest blocks the M25 for seventh timeFormer Australian PM attacks Aukus deal: \u0026#39France believes it has been deceived and humiliated, and she was\u0026#39When do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?Winter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?Halloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31Draconid Meteor shower 2021: when to see it peak in the UK, plus other dates to watch out forOctober\u0026#39s Hunter\u0026#39s Moon: when it will peak in the UK and full moon dates for 2021Comment: The ghost of Corbyn still haunts Keir StarmerUp to 30pc of taxi drivers unable to work due to fuel shortage, says industry amid calls for priority listFrench accuse UK of igniting a new fishing warWednesday morning UK news briefing: Threat of new Brexit fishing warWayne Couzens: the former Met officer who hid dark secrets behind family-man facadeHome Office slashes immigration enforcement budget as Channel crossings soarGovernment clears the field for trials of gene-edited cropsWorld’s largest vertical farm worked by robots sends food production onwards and upwardsComment: We must boost wages to fill staff vacanciesSir Keir Starmer: Winning an election more important than Labour Party unityTeesside Parmo brings a northern flavour to Commons menuBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wayne couzens former met officer hid dark secrets behind facade","story":"On the surface, Wayne Couzens was a dedicated police officer and a devoted family man who was never happier than when playing with his children or tinkering with his Ducati motorcycle.But underneath the veneer of respectability was a sexual deviant who, fuelled by extreme pornography, was driven to ever more depraved actions to slake his desires.Despite being an armed officer tasked with protecting politicians, dignitaries and VIPs, Couzens admitted regularly using prostitutes and was also suspected of taking dangerous body-building steroids.While he made every effort to hide his dark behaviour from his colleagues, questions will inevitably now be asked about the Met’s vetting and monitoring procedures that failed to spot his descent into crime.Just three days before abducting, raping and murdering Sarah Everard, Couzens allegedly flashed two female members of staff at a McDonald\u0027s drive-thru restaurant in Swanley, Kent.Tragically, despite CCTV cameras identifying his car, he was not arrested for the alleged offence until it was too late.His appalling actions have not only devastated the family and friends of his victim, Sarah Everard, but have also torn apart the lives of those who were closest to him - including his Ukrainian-born wife and two children.Born in Dover, Kent, in 1972, Couzens was the eldest of two boys, whose father ran a body shop and garage.After leaving school, both Couzens and his younger brother joined their father working in the business.A former receptionist at the family-run garage said Couzens was kind, thoughtful and charming and she could not believe that he was the same person who had abducted, raped and killed Sarah Everard.She said: “Wayne was lovely to work with. He was a really nice chap. He was thoughtful and friendly and got on with his work.“I was the only lady who worked there because it was a garage, but he was always polite and respectful towards me. When he was arrested for the poor girl’s murder I was completely shocked.“I just thought ‘what can have happened to change him that way, what could have triggered him to do that? There was absolutely no sign he could be like that when I knew him.“The Wayne I remember was kind and thoughtful, so when he was arrested I was absolutely stunned. Something must have happened to him after he joined the police.”Her husband added: “He didn’t come from a dysfunctional family. His father was a well-liked local businessman and family man, his uncle, Roy, was a prominent member of the Dover Lifeboat team, his younger brother also became a policeman. They were all respectable members of the community. How he turned out to do what he did is a mystery.”The former receptionist, now in her 70s, worked at the BCB garage set up by Mr Couzens Snr until 2002. Couzens worked there as a light vehicle body repair technician until 2011, when he followed in his younger brother’s footsteps and left to join the police. Becoming a police officer had been an ambition he had harboured for many years and between 2005 and 2009 he volunteered as a Special Sergeant with his local Kent force. He also served as an Army reservist for two years, where he developed a fascination for firearms.In 2011 he was finally accepted by the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), an armed police force tasked with guarding the country’s atomic power network.After undergoing initial firearms training he was posted to the Sellafield reprocessing site in Cumbria, where he spent eight months before transferring to the Dungeness Nuclear Power station close to home in Kent.But after seven years of unblemished service with the force he applied for a transfer to the politan Police.Despite the fact his new role would require a four-hour round commute, Couzens was ambitious to take his career to the next level.After joining the Met he was initially posted to a Safer Neighbourhood Team before joining a response team in Bromley.In February 2020, having already qualified as a firearms officer with the CNC, he was able to join the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command based at Empress State Building in West Brompton.His duties involved providing armed protection to some of the capital’s embassies.It was after joining the Met that Couzens reportedly became obsessed with bodybuilding and working out in the gym.Colleagues noted that he became big very quickly, leading to speculation that he may have been abusing steroids.One former Scotland Yard armed officer, who was sacked from the force, said such behaviour was not unknown.“The gym is a big part of the culture among some of the lads. They are naturally competitive and they like to get big so the temptation can be there to dabble in steroids. There are some pictures of  Couzens where his arms are huge so it would not surprise me at all.”Couzens met his Ukrainian wife in 2006 on the internet and the pair began dating online, messaging one another regularly.She was working in Switzerland at the time and after meeting in person they got engaged and Couzens travelled to Ukraine to meet her family.After marrying in her home country, they settled in the UK, where his university-educated wife secured a job as a laboratory manager at a scientific company in Kent.The couple had two children, a boy and a girl, now aged 10 and eight, whom Couzens appeared to dote on, according to neighbours.The family settled in Deal rather than his native Dover to be nearer his 70-year-old mother so she could help with childcare.Couzens’s Ukrainian mother-in-law was full of praise for her daughter’s hard-working husband and his devotion to their children.Speaking to The  from her home in Kirovograd, 300 miles south of Kiev, after his arrest, Nina Sukhoreba, said: “He is a wonderful family man, a wonderful man. He is a wonderful father. He came to visit with the children and we all walked to the river and he helped me at home and in the garden.”Following their wedding, the couple visited Ukraine every year and Couzens was even studying the language in order to communicate more easily with her wider extended family.Couzens’ brother-in-law, Vitaly Obuhov, said the family had not been able to process what had happened, but had spoken to Couzens on Skype on March 1, just two days before Mis Everard was abducted and killed.He said: “He seemed fine when we spoke to him. There were no issues at all. This is all so shocking. He is an extremely warm person, very polite and calm. I have never seen him treating my sister or children badly. It is hard to believe he was capable of what he did.”But privately Couzens is suspected of having a dangerous addiction to extreme pornography.Just 39 minutes before he was arrested, Couzens wiped all the data from his mobile phone and was also spotted by neighbours throwing an SD memory card out of the upstairs window.Couzens was close to his late uncle Roy, a key member of the Dover lifeboat station where he was operations manager.He was awarded an RNLI Silver Medal for gallantry for his part in the rescue of three freight ship crewmen during the 1987 hurricane which swept across southern England.A fundraiser and volunteer for Dover Lifeboat Station who knew Roy Couzens before his death in October 2020, aged 73, said: “To be honest it’s a relief that Roy died before his nephew killed that poor girl.“He would have been absolutely devastated that any relative of his had done such a terrible thing. His father is very ill now and I know he was absolutely shattered by what happened. It’s been terrible for the family.”Locals in Deal who knew Couzens and his wife described them as being the perfect family who were completely devoted to their children.One neighbour said: “They were just an ordinary family, they were friendly and chatty and seemed very happy“You would sometimes see Wayne in his uniform so we knew he was a policeman. He was also a biker and would often be tinkering with his bike in the garage.”More from NewsInsulate Britain block the M25 for seventh timePolitics latest news: Keir Starmer will not make same mistakes as Corbyn, says shadow minister ahead of keynote speech  Former Australian PM attacks Aukus deal: \u0026#39France believes it has been deceived and humiliated, and she was\u0026#39Sarah Everard: Former Met officer Wayne Couzens to be sentenced for murderWhen do the clocks go back, and why do we do it?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wednesday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Ministers announced that just 12 licences would be granted to French vessels under 12m in length, out of a total of 47 that had applied to fish UK inshore waters.France\u0027s Europe minister threatened retaliatory action, while fishing leaders branded the move a declaration of war on the water and the land.Comment and analysisIf you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

When I heard what she’d said, my reaction was summed up in just one. FINALLY. And her words spurred me into action – I joined the Labour Party.Angela’s observations weren’t what we’re used to in the slick, rehearsed world of politics today. They were raw. Real. Honest. At last, someone voiced the fiery fury and outrage I’ve been feeling for so long. Somebody brimming with passion, and anger, at the way people in this country have been – are being – treated. At the injustice, the cruelty, the corruption. At the cuts that will only hurt those who need the most help. Do you agree  Join the discussion in the comment section  At the shambolic incompetence that cost needless lives at the height of the pandemic, and has plunged Britain into chaos this week, today, right at this very second. And the way none of it seems to make any dference, because they get away with it over and over again. Much has been made about Angela’s use of the word ‘“scum” but we’re talking about a party that had to be shamed into feeding hungry children by a footballer. The cap is a perfect fit.The only thing I loved more than what Angela said  Her refusal to apologise for it. At a time when cancel culture rules all, when people fall over themselves to say sorry, out of fear for the personal consequences rather than genuinely being sorry, how refreshing that someone – especially a woman – says nope, I meant that.Get all the latest news straight to your inbox. to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters Her statement has proved unpopular with many, but she’s standing by it, with her head held high. I find that inspiring. Amidst all the criticism, Angela tweeted a few of the many examples of completely unacceptable things the PM has said. “People seem to be far more concerned with my choice of language than the fact Boris Johnson has made comments that are racist, homophobic and sexist,” she wrote. “I’m very happy to sit down with Boris. If he withdraws his comments and apologises, I’ll be very happy to apologise to him.” This is exactly the chutzpah I want my Labour Party to have. Precisely what I want them to be doing: standing up to the bullies.Angela Rayner isn’t perfect, but she’s open, direct and honest... coincidentally, the exact opposite adjectives you’d use to describe Boris Johnson.Her energy reminded me of that famous speech from  film Network, where the incensed news broadcaster tells viewers, “I want you to get up right now. Sit up. Go to your windows. Open them and stick your head out and yell – ‘I’m as mad as hell and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’ Things have got to change. But first, you’ve gotta get mad! You’ve got to say, ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’ Then we’ll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first, get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’” Angela Rayner is mad as hell and she’s not going to take this any more.

Labour has slammed Health Secretary Sajid Javidaposs mixed messages on Covid passports.Deputy leader Angela Rayner said: The government’s approach to Covid passports has been shambolic from the start. There has never been any clarity from ministers about what vaccine passports were supposed to achieve, how they would work and what was expected from businesses and workers. Health Minister Maggie Throup said: “Our Autumn and Winter plan puts us on a sure footing and gives the whole country the best possible chance of living with COVID- in the months ahead, without the need for unwanted social and economic restrictions. “The vaccine programme has tilted the odds in our favour in our shared fight against this virus and while we are totally confident the careful steps we are taking will help rule out the need for mandatory vaccine certicates, we need to be prepared for all scenarios.  Brits have already been braced for a dficult winter as respiratory viruses including Covid and the flu thrive in the cold seasons.

Starmeraposs allies say he will be underlining that feeling by claiming the Tories are strong on slogans, weak on government. These are serious times that require serious leadership, they say. Starmeraposs five days at the Brighton seaside may have helped the party turn the page on the Corbyn era for good. His aides say winning the battle over internal party rules and the departure of the last Corbynite standing from his shadow cabinet have tightened his grip. They revealed that he will not mention his predecessor by name in his speech - and has a quick response ready for any renditions of aposOh, Jeremy Corbynapos. But it will be clear that when he is talking about competence he wonapost just be meaning Boris Johnson.And he will namecheck some of the successes of the previous Labour governments run by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He will announce new policies that will show the direction of travel he intends to take the party in the run-up to the next election. He has also taken inspiration from the victory of a left-wing party in Germany this weekend - despite all the polls writing them off as outsiders. Starmer began writing his speech, which will be watched by his we Vicky on the front row, on his family summer break in Dorset.

On the eve of delivering his speech last night, before making the final tweaks, Starmer told the Mirror that he was not nervous. But his judge tomorrow will not be those watching him in the room.

The Labour leader is to put a revolution in education at the heart of his conference speech, to boost the futures of children.Mr Starmer will say in Brighton: “Labour will launch the most ambitious school improvement plan ever.” He will vow to fix an education system battered by more than a decade of austerity as he puts the future of children at the heart of Labour’s revolution With almost half of pupils leaving school without the qualications that can give them a good start in le, the party leader is to pledge to recruit thousands of teachers to fill vacancies and skills gaps across the profession. Can Keir connect  Have your say in the comment section  Mr Starmer will on Wednesday set out his upbeat blueprint for governmenthe is voted into No at the next election, in the biggest speechhis career.Announcing Labour is “back in ­business”, he is to present himself as a serious alternative to Boris Johnson, who has presided over a string of ­blunders, U-turns and excuses during the pandemic.It comes after a period of infighting in the party and the shock resignation of Shadow Employment Rights ­Secretary Andy McDonald.Asked on Tuesday what is most ­important to him, unity within the party or winning, Sir Keir said: “Winning. Winning a general election. “I didn’t come into politics to vote over and over again in Parliament and lose, and then tweet about it. I came into politics to go into government to change millions of lives for the better.” Even before Covid struck, , primary age children in England were growing up in areas without a primary school rated good or outstanding.

And heads and teachers will get more ongoing development and leadership skills training. Mr Starmer said this week private schools would pay £.billion a year in tax to fund a learning revolution for state-educated children under Labour. The Government has committed extra funding for schools in England next year, but it will not reverse a cut in real terms school spending per pupil.  And its school recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins quit after Mr Johnson rejected his £billion plans to help the ­education system recover from Covid. Labour insiders said the speech would be a forceful diagnosis of the state of the nation after more than a decade of disastrous Tory rule.Mr Starmer is keen to prove the party has changed since Jeremy Corbyn led it to election catastrophe in . He will say: “Too often in the history of this party our dream of the good society falls foul of the belief that we will not run a strong economy. “But you don’t get one without the other. And under my leadership we are committed to both. “I can promise you that under my leadership Labour will be back in ­business.” And he will turn his gaze firmly out towards the country.  Mr Starmer will highlight the fuel crisis and the rising cost of living as evidence the PM lacks competence and the Government is “lost in the woods”. The fiercely private politician will give his most personal address yet, with we Vicky watching from the front row, sharing previously unheard details of how his background shaped him. One Labour aide said: “Keir’s speech will be noticeably dferent from what you’ve heard from Labour in recent years. It will be more optimistic, more focused on the future. “The speech will be a demonstration of the way the Labour party has changed. It will be a clear indication that Labour will never again go into an election with a manesto that isn’t a serious plan for government.” But Mr Starmer faces fury from the left for opposing a £-an-hour minimum wage – a key reason Mr McDonald cited in his resignation. And after he quit he told the leader Labour was more ided than ever over the infighting. But Mr Starmer insisted Mr McDonald’s “wrong”. There was already rows over the suspension of Mr Corbyn from the party for refusing to apologise over accusations of anti-Semitism on his watch. Mr Starmer said it was up to the former leader as to whether he gets the Labour whip back as the “ball is in his court”. He added: “The position today is exactly as it was when we last spoke, which is an issue between Jeremy and the chief whip. And it is unresolved.  “Jeremy was asked to apologise, to take down the post that caused the problem and to work with us. But I am trying to turn our party from a party that spends far too much time talking to itself to a party that talks about the issues that matter to the country.” Mr Corbyn earlier told a fringe event: “There is no case other than I should be reinstated on the Labour whip.” Mr Starmer also admitted to “huge agreements and disagreements” with his deputy Angela Rayner. He said he has spoken to her after she branded the Tory party “scum” but it is understood he stopped short of scolding her. He added: “I wouldn’t have used the words that she used.” Comment MORE ON Keir StarmerPoliticsLabour PartyLabour Party ConferenceTeachersEducation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Here are the highlights of Keir Starmers first in-person conference as leaderLabour Party leader Keir Starmer will give a speech later this week Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByRachel Wearmouth:,  Sep | commentsKeir Starmer will this morning be putting the finishing touches to the speech he will give to Labour conference. It will be the former director of public prosecutionsapos first in-person address to the partyaposs rank and file since he was elected leader back in April .Mr Starmer will be looking to turn the page on the Jeremy Corbyn era and plot how the party canto power after its worst defeat since . But how has Labour conference panned out for the Opposition  Itaposs been a bit of a rollercoaster.Here are the highs and lows of Labouraposs annual conference so far. High - Keir Starmer winning a battle with the Left over rule changesThe leader put himself on a collision course with unions over rule changes which will empower MPs and make it harder for a Left-wing candidate to get on the ballot in any future leadership election. Candidates will now need the backing of % of MPs, or  on current numbers, in any race to succeed Mr Starmer. The registered supporters scheme, which allowed people who paid a small fee and signed a declaration of support to vote - something which many blame for Jeremy Corbynaposs victory - will also be ditched. Conference also backed proposals to raise the bar for which MPs can face a deselection threat, from a third of members or trade unions affiliates to half of both groups. Mr Starmer had wanted to ditch the one-member-one-vote system for leadership elections and sht the party back to the electoral college, which saw the vote for new leaders split between unions, grassroots members and MPs. But the Leader was forced to take the plan off the table at the eleventh hour after unions blocked the plan. Nevertheless, that some radical reforms made it past the conference floor, albeit with a very slim majority, says that Mr Starmer is able to command the movement – a key test of any Labour leader. Low - Angela Rayner row calling Tories scum Labouraposs Deputy Leader sparked major controversy when she lashed out at the Tories at a fringe event. She said: I’m sick of shouting from the sidelines and I bet you lot are as well. We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile [inaudible] Banana Republic, vile, nasty, Etonian [inaudible] piece of scum.” To applause, she added she had held back a little.  Her comments were seized on by opponents and left many of Ms Rayneraposs Labour colleagues frustrated, as the fear her words used against the party with Red Wall voters lost to the Conservatives in . Mr Starmer was repeatedly asked about the outburst during an interview with the BBC and the row has increased the tensions between the two figures.High - Rachel Reeves tub-thumping speech Labouraposs Shadow Chancellor won rave reviews for her barnstorming speech setting out her partyaposs vision for the economy. As well as being full of zingers – she told Amazonaposs Jeff Bezos “ you can afford to fly to space, you can pay your taxes here on Earth – it was also packed with policy. Ms Reeves unveiled how a Labour Government would spend £bn *a year* on green projects, showing her instincts are closer to Joe Bidenaposs not Tony Blairaposs.The thread running through her attack on Rishi Sunak - the Tories are all tax and no strategy - was that Labour could be trusted on the economy again.I know how hard people work for their wages and how carefully they manage their money, she said. They rightly expect government to treat money with that same respect,” she said.  Low - Bakersapos union disaffiliating after more than  years The Bakers, Food  Allied Workers Unionfounded Labour, alongside others, in . But this week it severed its historic link with the party and disaffiliated from the party, accusing Mr Starmer of a factional internal war led by the leadership. The move follows the rule changes pushed through and Labouraposs refusal to back a £-an-hour minimum wage. However, it also comes after Labouraposs decision to kick BFAWUaposs president Ian Hodson out of the party over his support for Labour Against The Witchhunt – a group banned under Labouraposs rules following repeated accusations of anti-Semitism.  The union has remained supportive of Jeremy Corbyn amid the former leaderaposs row with Starmer. But while sources close to the Labour leadership accuse Hodson of throwing his toys out the pram, the symbolic decision will sting some within Labour. It also means the union will cease donating. High - Stamer neck-and-neck with Johnson in poll Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson are now neck-and-neck on who would make the best Prime Minister, according to a poll by Ipsos Mori. It comes as the fuel crisis gripping Britain threatens to engulf Britain, with Labour blaming Tory incompetence, and after the PM announced tax hikes and a cut to Universal Credit.The survey found the two leaders were with % of adults backing each of them as the most capable leader. The last time a Conservative leader was not ahead on this measure, according to the pollster, was January , when Gordon Brown was on % and David Cameron %.Labour was also up six points in the Westminster voting intentions, to %, compared to August, with the Conservatives down two points to %, and the Liberal Democrats down four points to %.Low - Andy McDonald resigning in wage row Shadow Cabinet member Andy McDonald dramatically quit his post in a decision which overshadowed the conference. The Shadow Employment Rights Secretary, who was one of the few survivors from Jeremy Corbynaposs era, resigned saying the leader had been told him to argue against a £ National Minimum Wage. This is something I could not do, he said.  Mr McDonald accused the Labour leader of not honouring his pledges to the membership and said the party was more ided than ever in a strongly-worded resignation letter. In the letter, addressed to Mr Starmer, he said: It is with deep sadness that I am tendering my resignation from the Shadow Cabinet. My role as Shadow Secretary of State for Employment Rights and Protections has become untenable. When you became leader, I accepted the role because I wanted to fight for the working people of this country. It has become clear to me that I cannot do this as a member of the Shadow Cabinet. Conference delegates later threw their weight behind the £ rate, heaping yet more pressure on Mr Starmer, whose team believe Mr McDonald had deliberately sabotaged conference. High - Ex-MP Louise Ellman rejoining Labour Former MP Dame Louise Ellman announced she is re-joining the Labour Party two years after she quit over anti-Semitism. The Liverpool Riverside MP left the party in , when she accused Jeremy Corbyn of consorting with Holocaust deniers and terrorists. Heris a huge boost for Mr Starmer, as he attempts to regain the partyaposs standing with the Jewish community. Under Jeremy Corbynaposs leadership, antisemitism has become mainstream in the Labour Party, she said at the time.  Today she announced she would rejoin - ing to my political home. It came hours after Labouraposs conference approved a new complaints procedure for racism complaints by a narrow margin. She wrote in a statement: I am confident that, under the leadership of Keir Starmer, the party is once again led by a man of principle in whom the British people and Britainaposs Jews can have trust. Whilst there remains a great deal more to do to tackle antisemitism in the party, I am encouraged by the steps already taken and the progress made so far. Low - Andy Burnham being a thorn in Starmeraposs side Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has made no secret of his enduring ambition to be Labour leader. The former frontbencher has made a string of eyebrow-raising interventions.  They include calling on Mr Starmer to back a much better alternative social care plan and saying the rule changes was badly timed. He has, it seems, made it his business to be a thorn in the leaderaposs side. Speculation has been re that he is trying to find a route back into Westminster, though he told reporters he is not hatching any plans to get back any time soon. Few will be convinced he truly means that.

John McDonnell accused the Labour leader of breaking his promises to the members as the partyaposs annual conference descended into infighting.Former leader Jeremy Corbyn also lashed out at his successor who he accused of seeking to prop up those with wealth and power.Labouraposs civil war was reignited on Monday when Mr McDonald dramatically quit as Shadow Employment Rights Secretary in a row over the minimum wage. He claimed Mr Starmer had told him to block a £ minimum wage and said the leader had not honoured “our commitment to socialist policies” One of the last survivors of the Corbyn era in the shadow cabinet, Mr McDonaldaposs departure stoked acrimony and caused tensions to spill into the open. On Tuesday, Mr McDonnell lashed out at Mr Starmer for going back on pledges during his Labour leadership campaign.AskedMr Starmer was trying to move in a completely dferent direction without him, Mr McDonnell told Sky News: “If he does, I wish he’d told us that when he stood for leader” “When he stood for leader there were two basic promises - one, ‘I will unite the party’. “When he was talking about uniting the party he talked about more member engagement, not less. “The second, he put out a -point policy plan which was largely based upon the last two manestos, and that’s how he got elected leader.” He said he had “tried to” support Mr Starmer but “some of us had to speak out” over factional changes at conference. Mr Corbyn told the Mirror that Mr Starmer should stick to his commitments during a fringe event. He said: I read the  points that he put forward for the leadership and I think when you put forward something you should try and stick to it as a policy thing. But I donapost want to get involved in some personal spat with people. I want to see a dferent society, a better world and a Labour movement that can deliver that by inspiring people. The former leader insisted that Mr McDonaldaposs departure was not a plot - after some critics accused him of trying to derail the conference. Shadow Scotland Secretary Ian Murray had branded the move deliberate sabotage, saying Mr McDonald had signed off Labouraposs policy of at least a £ minimum himself. Mr Corbyn said he had series of private conversations with Mr McDonald, who is a close friend. Andy worked very closely with us in the shadow cabinet and he took what was for him a personal and very dficult and very principled decision, he said. If it had been a deep-laid Machiavellian plot to announce a resignation on a particular afternoon in Brighton, it wouldaposve leaked out weeks ago. Mr Corbyn, who lost the Labour whip in a row over anti-Semitism last year, said he believed he should be admitted back into the parliamentary party after having his membership restored. He said: I don’t think the Parliamentary Labour Party should try to gainsay what the National Executive has decided so as far as I am concerned there is no case other than I should be reinstated on the Labour whip. It comes as Mr Corbyn called on the Labour party to have a sense of humanity and self-criticism on the part they played in wars in the past. Speaking at a Labour Conference fringe event on aposHow can we end  years of the war on terror , he said:We need to look to the future where we have a foreign policy and international justice strategy based on peace or justice, on human rights and respect for people and deal with the real issues of this planet. Which are global poverty inequality, as COVID is showing us and of course, the threats of environmental destruction and climate change, that has to be the right way forward. Yesterday Mr Corbyn accused Mr Starmer of failing to challenge the wealthy and the powerful. Writing in the i newspaper, he said: So far this week, Labour’s leaders have shown they want to prop up, not challenge that wealth and power. There is another way forward, that is based on social justice, and in the policies the majority of people actually want, not what the establishment and its media mouthpieces insist they should want.

The Times shared a photograph of Rayner having a cigarette during a break in an article about Keir Starmer not backing up her “scum” comments. The Daily Mail dedicated an entire article to Rayner having a “crafty cigarette”. Of course, it isn’t unusual for the public to make attempts to discredit a working-class woman in this way. Open up Twitter and you’ll see post upon post about how Rayner isn’t “classy”, or compared with other Conservative female MPs she’s “tacky” or like “chalk and cheese”. Even the Twitter account for Leave.EU tweeted that Rayner had no “class”. All ignoring the fact that Conservative MP James Gray admitted he made a joke about delivering a bomb to the office of Labour chair Anneliese Dodds.  But I digress — as we’ve all come to learn, working-class womenare judged to a much higher standard than others. When they can’t attack their brains, people will go for the superficial. Like hair extensions , smoking, accents, semantics.They do this all while distracting from or ignoring the serious issues plaguing the working-class communities in our country. Universal Credit cuts, soaring energy prices… who cares about that when Angela Rayner called the people responsible for those things “scum”  You only have to look at the Daily Mail article that dedicated itself to Rayner’s smoking habit and calling senior Tories “aposracist, homophobic, scum”. In the same piece, a couple of paragraphs in, it was quoted that a government official said that Rayner was “talking crap”. Why is that exempt from criticism but Rayner’s comments aren’t  Why is Rayner’s “class” being called into question when someone ’s isn’t  Why can Boris Johnson make comments about single parents and hijabs or Sajid Javid make transphobic remarks, but Rayner can’t call someone “scum”   It’s called the patriarchy and its ever-present double standards. But obviously, people don’t stop there. Rather than put Rayner’s comments down to her being from the working-class — she worked as a carer before becoming an MP — they put it down to “her strategy” to appeal to the working-class. Because apparently, all the working-class care about is calling Tory officials scum and whether or Rayner takes a cigarette break or not and whether she looks tacky doing so . Rayner’s comments, her appearance and her mass appeal have everything to do with her authenticity and her bravery to call out officials like Johnson, Dominic Raaband other senior leaders. It’s to do with her empathy for the working-class — her working-class.

About  men are said to be at a hostel in Southwark, South London, despite a local council calling the facility unsafe to house rough sleepers.That was said to be because of an inability to maintain proper social distancing in light of the rise of coronavirus.It has been reported that because of a Covid outbreak at the facility in recent weeks a number of people had been infected. It comes after new figures revealed the number of people who had made the dangerous journey across the English Channel in small boats this year had doubled the total for all of .  At least  people succeeded in reaching the UK on Sunday, bringing the total for the year to at least ,, according to official data. Small boats arrivals in  now stand at more than double the figure for the whole of , when , people crossed the Dover Strait.The Independent reports that residents at the London facility had spoken of incidents where their roommates tested positive for Covid but couldnapost isolate until several days later.It has been claimed that more than  people were sleeping in some of the rooms. Southwark Council is said to have not been consulted about the plan to move people into the hostel, and wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel warning it poses “immediate risks” to both asylum seekers and local residents.  The council was said to have demanded aposurgent interventionapos to ensure the safety of residents there, saying an outbreak was aposentirely predictableapos given overcrowding. One resident, an Ethiopian national, told the publication: “We are worried. I don’t feel safe. It’s lots of people in a small space. “Everyone has complained, but they don’t do anything about it. The staff say they can’t do anything and that we must talk to the Home Office, but the Home Office doesn’t respond to our calls.” Another resident, from Eritrea, said two weeks ago a roommate had tested positive for Covid but remained in the shared room. He said: “I immediately advised the hostel staff that he should isolate, but they didn’t tell him to. The guy was sick for three days. We had no masks at that time. He got very sick and one night I had to call an ambulance. It wasn’t until five days later that he got moved to another room. A spokesperson for Migrant Help, contracted to support asylum seekers, said it worked “hard to support as many asylum seekers as possible” and its average call waiting time in August was  minutes. A Home Office spokesperson was reported to have said all of its accommodation “must meet relevant health and safety legislation and provide their latest health and safety risk assessment”. They added: “Due to unprecedented demand we have had to use temporary accommodation to manage demands on the asylum estate and we encourage all local authorities to volunteer their support and work with us. “We take the welfare of asylum seekers very seriously and work closely with our providers, Public Health England and other relevant authorities to ensure all medical advice is closely followed and people self-isolate where needed.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Home OfficeCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate was joined by her husband Prince William as well as Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall on the red carpet at the Royal Albert Hall to watch the latest film in the spy franchise.She looked stunning in a gorgeous custom sparkling gold sequinned Jenny Packham cape gown and wore her hair up off her face to show off her beautul gold earrings by Onitaa that she previously wore on a tour of Pakistan. The royals were able to meet the filmaposs producers and directors before the screening of the film as well as James Bond himself - actor Craig - who is in his fth and final outing as Bond. And when she greeted him, he told her: You look jolly lovely. Elsewhere, Camilla opted for a pale blue corseted chfon dress with silver embroidery by Bruce Oldfield. Both William and his dad Charles looked very -like in black tuxedos. Other members of the Bond cast who walked the red carpet and met the royals included Rami Malek, Lea Seydoux and Lashana Lynch.

A number of healthcare workers and members of the armed forces joined the royals and the cast in the auditorium to watch the film as a thank you for their work during the Covid pandemic. The world premiere also benefited charities supporting serving and former members of the three intelligence agencies - the Secret Intelligence Service, the Security Service and GCHQ - as well as charities supporting past and present members of the UK Special Forces. The th instalment of the spy series has faced more than a year of delays due to the Covid- outbreak, but is being released in UK cinemas on Thursday. No Time To Die takes place after Bond has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil le in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help. A mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading to a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. It is just the fourth Bond movie to be chosen to have a royal presence the premiere.The last Bond film, Spectre, saw William, Kate and Prince Harry turn out for the first screening.The other two to be given the royal treatment were Die Another Day and Skyfall.

The unnamed -year-old woman from Norden, Rochdale, accidentally tipped scalding water on herself while holidaying in Northumberland. Having been suffering with her sinuses she had decided to try and steam them, but not being used to the kitchen set up caught the bowl and knocked it down her front.She was unable to treat the burns alone and so ed home with her husband to attend Rochdale Infirmaryaposs Urgent Care Centre as the town doesnapost have an AE, reports the Manchester Evening News. A staff member told her there would be a five-and-a-half hour wait for urgent care and so sent her to Fairfield Generalaposs Accident and Emergency Department in Bury.Have you suffered a similar experience due to the streaming protocol  Let us know at webnews@mirror  But the patient was told, due to protocol, staff couldnapost treat someone from outside the immediate area. She was then forced to sit outside on the pavement until her husband - who couldnapost wait with her in AE due to Covid restrictions - could come back to pick her up. “I couldn’t believe it, I was absolutely dumbstruck, the patient said, referring to being sent away. She said after having her temperature checked a nurse asked which surgery she is a member of and she said Edenfield Road. She said ‘that’s Rochdale’, I replied ‘yes’, and she said ‘we’ve got a protocol now that we’re not treating people from Rochdale’. “I said ‘what !’, she said ‘I’m really sorry but we can’t treat you’.”  “I said my husband has dropped me off at the door because he wasn’t allowed in, I was obviously in a lot of pain. And the nurse said ‘I’m sorry but you’ll have to go back to Rochdale’. I told her I’d just come from there and there was a five-hour wait. “She said ‘I’m sorry’, then got up and went out and started calling the next patient in. “So I didn’t really have a lot of choice. I wasn’t in a position to pick a fight. At this stage it was around pm and rush hour traffic had peaked, with her husband battling to get to her for half an hour as she sat outside.  “I just feel like it’s outrageous that someone on their own, in pain, would be turned away from the nearest AE to them, she said. “We don’t have an AE in Rochdale, and we were under the understanding that we could go to Bury which is the next nearest. “I just don’t know how anybody can justy treating me like that. On arriving back at Rochdale, she explained the situation to the same nurse whoaposd advised her to go to Fairfield and she couldnapost believe it. The patient was then rushed through and seen by a doctor. She said she doesnapost blame the doctors and nurses for her treatment but is very, very concerned about the welfare of people in Rochdale. I’m hoping that whatever this protocol is, it will be stopped. It’s something nobody seems to know about, evenyou have to accept it, it should be public knowledge.  Northern Care Alliance NHS Group has claried that patients who attend AE needing emergency care will always receive it - regardless of where they live or where their GP is based. A protocol relating to location does, however, exist and has been introduced as apospart of the reconfiguration of services across Greater Manchesterapos to improve patient safety and access, referred to as streaming and introduced several months ago. Dr Chris Brookes, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Medical Officer at the NHS group added: We are not treating patients ‘based on their locality’, but treating patients in the most appropriate place based on their clinical condition and with consideration, where possible, treating them in a place closest to their own home. “Where a patient’s GP surgery is located does not affect which AE they can be treated at, and via patient streaming we will always treat a patient in the right service closest to their home. “All of our urgent care staff have been fully briefed about the streaming service via their line managers and in team meetings including what to doa patient does not want to be streamed to an alternative setting.” Comment MORE ON NHSHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ian Tomlinson and his family had booked six months in advance to spend their summer holiday at the Retallack Resort near Newquay, Cornwall. The hotel is one of Cornwall’s top watersports centres, featuring an aqua park, a floating volleyball court, a wave pool and wakeboarding. But upon reaching the hotel following a four-hour drive, he was told by the hotel that there was no record of the booking they had made through the travel website Booking, and there was no way of fitting them in. Alerted to their plight, Booking sent an email telling the family that they had found them a similar alternative – in Uxbridge, a London suburb close to Slough. In the email, the agency said it hoped they were “having a great day”, thereports. Despite attempts to contact Booking by email and phone, Ian was unable to reach a representative from the agency and the family were forced tohome. “Uxbridge was  miles away and not a place anyone would choose to have a holiday,” Ian told the paper. “I had two very tired, upset children who were looking forward to all the resort’s attractions including a FlowRider wave machine for surfing, and my we was in tears. We were not having a great day.” It took  days for the travel agency to respond to Ian, where they claimed the hotel had overbooked and that it would consider refunding his costs but would not provide compensation for upset children. The online travel agency refunded the familyaposs expenses and paid them £ in compensation but did not explain how the error occurred.

They checked in at the easyJet desk at Bristol Airport on Friday and handed over their baggage and car seat at the check-in desk. The family were planning to drive from Lisbon across the border to western Spain to stay with Ireneaposs family for the ceremony on Saturday. Leigh and Irene had filled in their Passenger Locator Forms but did not think they needed one for two-year-old Antonio.However, at the check-in, they were given a form to fill in for the toddler and then went through security as normal, Bristol Live reports.Has something similar happened to you  Email webnews@mirror  Leigh said: We were pushing Antonio in his pushchair and when we got to the bottom of the steps to the plane, I carried him up the steps, and a guy with the ground crew took the pushchair and put it with the rest of the luggage to go on the plane. The family from Long Ashton, near Bristol, settled down for a routine flight, landed in Lisbon and thought nothing untoward had happened until they waited an hour in vain for their luggage to arrive at Lisbon Airport. When they contacted easyJet, they were left fuming as they were told the airline had taken their luggage, car seat and pushchair off the plane. Leigh and Irene were stunned when easyJet said it was because their systems had flagged that the three passengers had been denied boarding at the exact moment they were settling down on board the plane. The dad-of-one said: I phoned up easyJet and said aposweaposre in Lisbon, can you send on our baggage apos and they said aposno you werenapost on the plane, you were denied boarding, your boarding passes werenapost scanned, so we took your stuff off the planeapos.  We had no idea. Looking back, they were more concerned with making sure everyone had their Passenger Locator Forms than they were actually checking us in and scanning our boarding passes, and they said we never boarded, but we did, we flew on the plane and we’re here in Spain. Iaposve had an email from easyJet saying apossorry you didnapost get your flightapos, and then another email askingwe’ll be getting theflight. Itaposs really concerning. Leigh said he is worried about safety on planes as well because nobody checkedtheir seats were actually empty. He explained: There are Civil Aviation Authority rules about knowing exactly who is on every flight. If that plane had to make a forced landing or we all had to be evacuated or something, they wouldn’t have looked for us, they thought we weren’t on board.  The captain of that plane should not have taken off because they had a list of people they thought were on the plane and we were on the plane but not on their list. Why, when they got the order to take our stuff off the plane because they thought we werenapost on it, didnapost they check our seats  They would have found us sitting in them. Due to the incident, Leigh, Irene and little Antonio were left without their belongings, so they were forced to buy a car seat and a pushchair in Portugal. Leigh said: My we is seven months pregnant at the moment. All our stuff for the wedding, suits, dresses, presents and so on, was in our luggage so we didn’t have that for the wedding on Saturday and we have the clothes we came in. I’ve lost luggage before - once I flew back from New York and the airline managed to get it to me in Bristol the next day. This is dferent. easyJet have refused to send it to us because they said we are not out here, when we did fly on their plane. In Spain we’ve got nothing, and over the weekend they were not even saying when or eventhey will send over our luggage. Iaposve been on the phone to easyJet a lot, obviously, and one woman was questioning that we were really in Spain. She said their records showed that we had been denied boarding, and hadnapost flown, but we did - we were on that flight. Thataposs really worrying, that that could happen. Itaposs been four days now and they called again on Monday to ask what the address is weaposre staying at. So hopefully it will all be sent over, but we have plans to go to another address this week, and what do we do  Everything is wrecked, the wedding and our trip so far. EasyJet told The Mirror that the problem occurred at the gate during boarding and an investigation is ongoing. The airline said the luggage has since been delivered and the company has apologised to the family for the delay. EasyJet said in a statement: easyJet works closely with all of our airports and partners to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and crew.We have launched an investigation with our ground handling partners at Bristol Airport to understand what happened in this instance and have apologised to Mr Husband and Ms Garcia Santos for the delay in reuniting them with their luggage, which has since been delivered to them.The safety and well-being of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority.

They could be put into action across the UK this week. Defence Minister Ben Wallace readied the troops on the same day that the Prime Minister insisted fuel shortages were easing. Johnson said the situation on the forecourts was stabilising and people should be confident to go about their business in the normal way. Since fuel suppliers reported some localised shortages last week, motorists have been rushing to their local garages for a top-up.  The surge in demand has led to huge queues on the roads and widespread shortages. At the worst point over the weekend just % of the nationaposs petrol stations were thought to be fully supplied. On the same day the MoD signed off the deployment of troops, Johnson said that the indications from the industry were that the situation was beginning to improve with supplies ing to normal levels. On the forecourts the situation is stabilising and people should be confident and just go about their business in the normal way, he said.His appeal came as Sir Keir Starmer accused the Government of reducing the country to chaos through its failure to deal with the fuel crisis. The Labour leader said the haulage industry was beyond frustrated at the lack of a clear plan by ministers to alleviate the problems caused by the shortage of tanker drivers. The Government has reduced the country to chaos as we track from crisis to crisis. The Government is not gripping this, he told BBC News. This problem was predictable and predicted and the Government has absolutely failed to plan. But with the Petrol Retailers Associationreporting early signs that the crisis was coming to an end, the Prime Minister expressed confidence the worst was over. Mr Johnson said the Government was putting in place measures to ensure the entire supply chain could cope in the run-up to Christmas.  I want to say first of all how much I sympathise with people who have been worried about their journeys, worried about whether they will be able to use their cars in the normal way, he said. I know how frustrating and worrying it must have been to worry about a shortage of petrol and fuel. We are now starting to see the situation improve. We are hearing from industry that supplies are coming back on to the forecourts in the normal way.  What we want to do is to make sure we have the preparations necessary to get through to Christmas and beyond, not just in the supply of our petrol stations but all parts of our supply chain. Mr Johnson rejected calls for healthcare staff and other workers to be given priority access to fuel, suggesting it was unnecessary given the easing of the situation. After the Government announced it would be issuing , temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers to alleviate the shortages which led to the crisis, he also dismissed demands for more overseas workers to be admitted. What we want to see is a an emphasis on a high wage, high skill, high productivity approach to our economy, he said. What I donapost think people in this country want to do is fix all our problems with uncontrolled immigration. We tried that for a long time and in the end, people could see that it was leading to a low wage, low skill approach without enough investment in people or in equipment. Thataposs not the way we want the UK to develop and grow.His comments came after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps acknowledged that Brexit, which cut off the supply of drivers from the EU, had been a factor in the crisis. No doubt it will have been a factor. On the other hand it has actually helped us to change rules to be able to test more drivers more quickly, he told broadcasters.. So, it has actually worked in both ways. Meanwhile PRA executive director Gordon Balmer said the numbers of filling stations reporting they had run dry was falling as fuel deliveries recovered. There are early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending, with more of our members reporting that they are now taking further deliveries of fuel, he said. We have conducted a survey of our members this morning and only % of forecourts have reported being out of fuel today.  With regular restocks taking place, this percentage is likely to improve further over the next  hours. Ministers have insisted throughout the crisis that fuel stocks remain high and that panic buying was unnecessary. They argued the sudden surge in demand was driven by reports of of a shortage of a small number of tanker drivers leading to some hold-up in deliveries. In one particularly extreme case of panic buying, a woman was spotted filling up eight jerry cans with fuel on a Teesside station forecourt. The Ford Fiesta driver was snapped on Sunday at a filling station in Oxbridge, Stockton, where she spent a total of £. on either petrol or diesel. Another garage user spotted her filling up the row of cans with fuel, putting in  litres. He pulled up to the pump after her and noticed the massive spend. With many still vying to fill up their tanks, a Government source has said the troops were still on standby but can now start training now itaposs approved. Some senior Tories urged ministers to go further and begin actively deploying the military to restore public confidence. The chairman of the Commons Defence Committee Tobias Ellwood told Sky News: Simply hoping this situation willto normal is not a strategy.

The results show that it’s Londoners who have the biggest appetite for heat:  per cent of those in the capital said they like their food to be nice and spicy or even to feel their mouths on fire. The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right.

Other motorists looked on in laughter as a Deliveroo order was brought for Lily Potkin, , who said she was stuck in the mother of all queues as she tried to fill up her car on Tuesday lunchtime amid the ongoing fuel crisis. She claimed it was a genius idea to order a Nandoaposs chicken wrap and peri-peri chips from Deliveroo to her car. The mum-of-three said: It was really funny. The people behind me saw him delivering it and the mood changed. Everyone was really aggy and then I could see all the people behind me cracking up. They were just in hysterics.  Lily spent £. on her Nandoaposs delivery, which a Deliveroo driver brought directly to her blue Mini. Her delivery instructions read: I am in the queue for petrol in my car, my car is a blue Mini. Lily also got a visit from her aunt, who lives down the road and brought her more snacks as she waited in the queue in Kingsbury, northwest London. Lily added: I joined the queue just before lunchtime. My car was on zero and Iaposve got to do the school run. Everything in me was saying aposgo home you idiotapos as I was sat there getting so hungry. It took me an hour to get around one side of a roundabout. I sat there and I thought about what my husband was having for lunch and got really hungry. The traffic was moving so slowly so I thought I could get a Deliveroo where I was. I put the delivery pin a little bit further down the road and he just pulled up right outside my window.Lily, who works at a tech firm, documented her Nandoaposs delivery in a Twitter thread and other social media users praised Lily as an absolute hero and thanked her for brightening up their days. Helen Carr said: You are an absolute hero! Well done on the Nandoaposs, your lovely aunt, and the petrol x. Jodie agreed: Fantastic! Well done on finally getting fuel! Loved the Nandoaposs and Auntie food deliveries - absolute genius. Daniel Barker said: Lily this is spectacular. Lily said that the petrol station was absolutely mental when she finally arrived two hours after leaving her home. She could only fill up with £ of fuel due to new restrictions and even got stuck behind someone who had put the wrong fuel in their car. Lily said: Itaposs like the hunger games. The forecourts are filled with people with their fuel canisters. There are normal people marshalling others around the station. Itaposs a really charged atmosphere.

They are desperate not to give up the treatment halfway through however, having waited two years to get to the front of the waiting list.  Mairi, , said: We canapost give this chance at IVF up, it might be the only one we get. Some weeks we are at the hospital three times a week and we just canapost afford it after we both lost our jobs because of Covid. We are desperate for this IVF to work, but we need to be able to get there for that to happen. Mairi and Jamie, , applied for the fertility procedure back in , and were warned that it aposcould take yearsapos to get off the long waiting list. In December , after a year of many pregnancy tests, they were given the news that they could begin the IVF process in Edinburghaposs Royal Infirmary.  But, in January of this year, only a month into the gruelling and costly process, Jamie lost his agency warehouse work.The company he was employed with dropped excess staff in a bid to gain back their losses due to the coronavirus pandemic.Determined to find new employment, they carried on with the fertility treatment. However, in April , Mairi lost her job in Starbucks, which was deemed as a result of the pressures the business was under during the pandemic.  By that point, the couple were  per cent of the way through the procedure and could not pull out or  theyaposd lose their golden opportunity of becoming a mum and dad. Mairi said that as well as losing both jobs, their shared  Honda Jazz broke down and couldnapost be repaired, meaning they would have to rely on public transport to get them to and from the hospital. She said: We are paying £ per day and some weeks we need to go three times so thataposs £ a week and we donapost have an income. I have been trying to sell my clothes and handbags and things that might make us some money and I have been making jewellery to sell as well, in the hopes that it will pay for trains and buses. I decided to set up a GoFundMe so hopefully that will help. We just donapost know how we can keep paying out these travel costs. I havenapost even been able to think about what will happenwe donapost raise the money. The couple, who married back in October , quickly found out that they struggled to conceive after trying for a child for well over  months. After doctors tested both Mairi and Jamie, it was discovered that due to antibodies in Jamieaposs sperm, they were unable to conceive naturally. So the news of IVF treatment in December  came as a golden chance for the couple to finally have a family of their own. Mairi has said that all being well she could be pregnant within weeks, but fears the whole process could have been for nothingthey canapost finance their transport. She added: Next week I am going to have my eggs removed and,theyaposre viable they will start the insemination process. Realistically I could be pregnant in a few weeks, but it just might not happenwe canapost get to the appointments.

June Williams, , from Pontarddulais, South Wales, is now demanding compensation from Swansea Council. She claims she has been battling mould in the three-bedroom property ever since she moved in around  years ago.

Iaposve got damp issues in my bedroom on both walls, I wipe it down with bleach, but it comes back.

June has also had to bin £, of her own clothes and shoes due to the mould - and she is now demanding the council pay her compensation.

Amy Falconer feels she was abandoned after losing her baby, which she described as the worst thing thataposs ever happened to her.The -year-old is haunted by the experience despite the arrival of her son Rocco in July, Edinburgh Live reported. The magazine account director said: “It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. There was just no support whatsoever. I was absolutely traumatised by it, but you just get sent home to deal with it. You’re completely alone. “Nobody phones to check on you, no-one makes any appointments to seeyou’re coping or to offer tests to find out what went wrong.  “There’s no other part of the health system where this happens. “Once you’ve had a baby, there’s so much help and support and expertise – but where is that for those who lose one ” Amy, who had four miscarriages before giving birth with her fiancé Fraser Rutherford, first fell pregnant in December . “After about nine weeks things began to change, I stopped feeling the changes that had happened in the early part of the pregnancy, she continued. “But I was told everything would be ok, not to worry, basically made to feel like I was just being silly. So of course I just kept going, but deep down I knew something was wrong. “Two weeks later – it was on Valentine’s Day – I got an early scan because I’d been spotting. I went in, had the scan, and there was no heartbeat. I knew the baby had died two weeks ago because all the symptoms had gone, but here we were.” Amy feels wider education about miscarriage would help people discuss the issue more generally. “No-one knows what to say, so they end up saying things that are really insensitive, even though they don’t mean it to be, they mean it to be the opposite,” she explained. “They say things like ‘oh it just wasn’t meant to be’ which is just the worst thing anyone can say. It’s a death of a baby, that’s what it is. But because we never speak about it as a society, no-one knows how to deal with it. “I was on a Zoom call not so long ago with five other women, and four of us had gone through a miscarriage. None of us had known previously, that was the first time any of us had mentioned it to each other.” Amy continued: “It’s so traumatic, but after the third and fourth, I didn’t even tell my family. What was the point ” Amy’s fourth miscarriage had added complications because It was an ectopic pregnancy, where the baby grows outside of the womb.  The scenario which means the baby can’t be born safely, and exposes mothers to huge risk too. “That was bad because I had to go in for tests every two days at the Royal Infirmary,” she said. “Every two days, walking into the labour ward, past mums who’d just had their babies and people with ‘congratulations’ balloons. “You’re not telling me in a hospital the size of the Royal, or any other hospital, that they can’t make sure people going through something like that are seen in a dferent place, where they didn’t have to walk past it all the time. It’s horric.” By the time her newborn baby arrived safely, the couple were scarcely able to believe it had happened. Amy said: “You just don’t believe it’ll turn out ok. We were too scared to buy anything cots, prams, clothes. Even after he’d arrived it took us a couple of weeks to properly process the reality of it all. “Before I got pregnant for the fth time, we’d began talking about alternatives. We spoke about the extra money we would have for the rest of our lives, and all the extravagant holidays we’d be able to go on. “We were basically filling our lives up with the things neither of us actually wanted to do. It’s a le that would have been void of the one thing we wanted. And of course it makes everything so much better when you’re able to successfully have a baby.  “But that first miscarriage will never, ever leave me.”The Scottish Public Health Observatory estimates at least one in every five pregnancies ends in miscarriage.Amy spoke out as an expert on female wellbeing warned that new strategy for women’s health must place serious focus on the estimated , women who suffer miscarriage in Scotland each year. Lisa Kitching, director of Edinburgh-based Baby Fit, said that urgent support was needed for women who up to now have little in the way of help. Baby Fit is a personal training business which specialises in providing fitness classes to women who have recently had a baby. It also works with couples attempting to conceive and going through IVF, as well as women who have suffered miscarriage and are trying again for a baby.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Lisa said: “Everyone says miscarriages are common, but I don’t think current services reflect the fact there were around , miscarriages in Scotland last year alone. “Many of my clients have suffered miscarriages, and it’s clear just how alone they’ve felt throughout that process.“Often they’ve just been given a tablet to take and sent home, despite that being among the worst moments of their lives.“Even women who are further on in their pregnancy and need hospital care sometimes have to go through the miscarriage on a labour ward where other women are giving birth to healthy babies in the next room. “Aside from the great work of some charities, there is very little emotional help for women and their partners going through this awful experience. “It’s definitely welcome that the Scottish Government has recognised this, but it will need to go beyond paid leave and the promise of better services. “We need to see urgent action to ensure every woman who suffers a miscarriage can access the help they need. Through this plan Scotland has a chance to be a world-leader in miscarriage care. For the sake of thousands of women every year I really hope it happens.” Comment MORE ON Scottish GovernmentPregnancyGiving birthNewborn babyMiscarriageFertility\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Albanian Koci Selamaj, , appeared at Willesden magistrates court today for a hearing which lasted approximately two minutes in front of a packed public gallery. He stood calmly with his hands clasped together, wearing grey prison-issue tracksuit and blue facemask and spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. Prosecutor Umaima Peracha said the charge against the defendant is murder on September . He was not asked to formally enter a plea to a single charge of murder but was asked by District Judge Denis Brennan for an indication of his plea.  His lawyer Aidan Harvey, said: “I have indicated on the form it will be a not-guilty plea.” Mr Harvey earlier told the court that although an interpreter was in the building, his client’s English was “sufficient for today’s purposes”. The judge told Selamaj: “Your first hearing there will be a bail hearing on September  with the plea and trial preparation hearing being on October . “I will remand you in custody.”  Selamaj, who is understood to have been working as a food delivery driver in Eastbourne, was arrested in the early hours of Sunday and charged on Monday.

The exterior stairway at a Holiday Inn hotel was constructed from the wrong type of wood and had not been properly maintained. A total of  guests plunged onto the hard courtyard below and seven had to be rushed to hospital. The court was told that two of the victims suffered long-term injuries. Last week magistrates handed out fines totalling £, to the hotel owners and a management company. The prosecution was brought by Dacorum Borough Council. Cllr Julie Banks said: “I consider the safety of local residents and visitors to be an imperative. We will vigorously investigate and take appropriate enforcement action where serious safety failings lead to serious injuries or deaths. “All those involved in running businesses and operations should understand that they may face prosecution for their part in such failings, as the two companies did here. Peterborough Magistrates’ Court heard the stairs at the hotel in Hemel Hempstead, were constructed from laminated softwood. Although they were regularly used, particularly for wedding photos, they had not been maintained leaving the timber rotten. The posts holding up the stairs were in particularly bad condition. The dramatic collapse occurred in  while a wedding party at the hotel was gathering for photos. The court heard the upper flight of stairs gave way like a trapdoor. HICP Ltd, which had owned the hotel since , was ordered to pay a fine, costs and surcharge totalling more than £,. Interstate United Kingdom Management Limited, which assisted HICP in the management of the hotel, was ordered to pay penalties of almost £,. The sentencing took place on September . Rebecca Connolly, a health and safety worker at DBC, helped investigate the incident. She said: Those who operate premises, which they charge the public to use, are required by law to put in place adequate arrangements to monitor the state of those premises and to ensure necessary repair or replacement work is identied and done. External timber structures are notoriously subject to decay and regular and rigorous checks on them need to be conducted by persons competent to do those checks.

David has been warned that his health could take a noseehe keeps up with the unhealthy eating habit. The -year-old, from Darlington, says he has a crippling fear of food textures and mushy ingredients and has not touched a vegetable since he was a child. David orders from the food menu while out for a meal, the Daily Mail reports. He has appeared on Tuesdayaposs episode of Extreme Food Phobics on W and even admitted himself his diet of chicken nuggets is ridiculous. The effects of the diet on Davidaposs health was relayed by Dr Ranj, the showaposs host. David, one of six children said he was worried his bizarre eating habit would rub off on his siblings.  David was told he could be at a higher risk of obesity-related health problems including heart disease and Type  diabetes. He said: If someone said my diet is ridiculous I would agree. But I would explain itaposs something deep in the back of my mind that I canapost change which is why Iaposve come to the clinic today to hopefully get some help. Itaposs awful to see my brother has started to eat this way and I know itaposs because of me heaposs started to become the same. Iaposve struggled putting on weight all my le so eating fruits and vegetables will just make me feel so much healthier. Dr Ranj showed David the amount of frozen food he eats monthly and tried to find the underlying reasons for his fear. David said he did not like trying new textures, or softer foods including mashed potatoes as it made him gag. David said his fear of mushy food has been hard and stressful for his mother as he has his own freezer at home so he can make his own dinner while she makes food for his siblings. He also described his embarrassment at going for meals when he has to plan in advance or order from a kids menu. He added that heartbreakingly there were times he had missed out because of his food fear. David said to combat his fear he wanted to try mashed potatoes. As part of his rehabilitation he spoke with a leading food phobia expert who took him into a room full of potatoes with a serving of mashed potatoes under a platter, which he said made him feel sickly and anxious.  David was also taken to a clinical psychologist for hypnosis which he said after made him feel much better. His final challenge was a banquet. At the end of the programme, David could be seen four weeks later eating a sandwich. He said: Itaposs been amazing the whole experience, now I can try anything andI donapost like it I donapost like it. Iaposm looking forward to going for meals with my family, not worrying about what Iaposm going to order or what Iaposm going to eat.

The footage in east London has gone viral with many on social media slamming those watching the scrap without trying to help out. But there is some doubt over whether it really was an attempted robbery as police have not yet received any official complaint. The two men were wrestling outside an HSBC branch in East Ham on what police believe was Monday. The clip shows people just watching on during the pushing and shoving at the cash machine. One man seems to be trying to use the machine and pushing away the other who is also grappling with him.On Twitter one person asked: “Whoaposs robbing who here  Why no punching, tripping over or beating  Doesnapost make much sense to me.”Most people on social media were amazed that no one tried to intervene. A tweet said: “So not ONE person thought to intervene  Just standing there filming ! This is madness!!!!” Another put it: “That is maddening to see, I appreciate people get worried, but surely someone could have attempted some sort of intervention, geez.” Most frustration was targeted at the people filming what happened.  “Two lads filming could be helping,” said a Twitter user. Another agreed: “It’s the generation we live in now. They would post it online and say how angry they are.” As it was just wrestling some people felt that it wasn’t a robbery. “I don’t think this is a random robbery , both blokes know each other and they are probably trying to both take the cash hence why no real violence apart from some sh**** dancing,” another person tweeted. A spokesman for the politan Police told The Sun Online: On the evening of Monday,  September, police were made aware of a video on social media appearing to show a robbery at a cashpoint in East Ham. Enquiries were carried out and it does not appear the initial incident had been reported to officers. We have made contact with the person who uploaded the video and are waiting for them to provide further details.

Bradley Lowery Way leading to Sunshine Place is part of the new Hardwicke Place development in Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, close to his familyaposs home. Sunshine was the nickname Gemma and husband Carl gave Bradley, due to his sunny disposition despite the pain and discomfort he was suffering throughout his illness.It proved a double celebration for Gemma who had turned up expecting to receive a cheque for the charity launched in her sonaposs name, Chronicle Live reports.Staff from Gleeson Homes which is constructing the development walked  miles - the equivalent distance of Landaposs End to John OaposGroats - raising an amazing £, for the Bradley Lowery Foundation.  After receiving the cheque she was asked to unveil a street sign. An emotional Gemma, who recently revealed she is pregnant with the coupleaposs third child, said: Itaposs absolutely incredible. Thank-you so much, it means so much to us. Sunderland fan Bradley was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of cancer found mainly in babies and young children, at the age of just  months. He struck up a friendship with then Black Cats striker Jermain Defoe and was a mascot for Sunderland. Bradley was even named joint winner of the December  BBC Goal of the Month for a penalty he took against Cha. He died in July,  aged six.  The Bradley Lowery Foundation was established in August . The foundation aims to support families who are fundraising for treatment or equipment, which is not readily available or covered by the NHS. Earlier this year Sarah Marsden, Divisional Managing Director at Gleeson said: “We are delighted to be commemorating Bradley by naming the roads on Hardwicke Place after him.

York Gins is owned and run by Emma Goala, , Pete McNichol, , Paul Crossman, , and -year-old Harry Cooke. Speaking to us following the good news, they said: We’re absolutely delighted to win the prize. As a small business in these very strange and uncertain times, any help we can get is very welcome. We couldn’t quite believe we’d won when we were contacted! We’re pretty used to winning gin-tasting competitions - but this was out of the blue. We think our business is special because we put people, the planet and fun at the very heart of everything we do. We pay the Living Wage and make sure everyone is fully trained and gets any outside training they may need. York Gin only launched in  but has also grown rapidly. The team added: When we started, two of us were working in a cold former chicken shed, making the gin and bottling, labelling and packing everything by hand. We had a good hunch that the local market would provide some demand for a locally-made gin - in fact one of our directors, Paul, is a pub landlord, so we thought at least we’ll have one customer!The team are looking forward to using the new Square Stand Kit, adding: We are always interested in trying new solutions to tricky problems like payments. The loyalty programme Square offers looks particularly interesting.We have plans to grow - but in a controlled and sustainable manner. We have plans to open a second shop in York. We already have a shop in the historic centre right opposite the famous Shambles and now plan a new shop in the city’s train station. We have ambitions to grow our online store too which Square could help us with. Squareaposs POS technology in particular is very flexible for our outdoor events - which are key now we are all doing things outdoors even more! It will make such a dference having technology with the ability to grow with us - Clueit Webb Interiors, Margate Ollie Clueit, , has been surrounded by collectables and antiques as long as he can remember, whether in his family home or at the boot sales and antique fairs his parentsdragged him to. But over the years his parentaposs passion developed into his own love of all things antique and vintage, and three years ago, Ollie left his career in the music industry, retrained as an upholsterer and moved to Margate, where he operated Recovered by Ollie from a  foot shipping container. The business has come a long way since then, claiming a  square foot workshop and a shop space, but it’s during the next exciting phase that the Square technology will be invaluable. Last year, Corinne Webb, , came on board to help Ollie with his workload, brining with her a wealth of experience in textiles and interior design, and the pair quickly realised they made a fantastic team, and decided to go into partnership together to expand and rebrand as Clueit Webb Interiors.  “We are going to be adding extra products to the website and physical shop,” said the duo. “The Square kit will really help us keep track of stock and give us a real understanding of what is selling and what isnapost, and help us decide what we should be restocking. “Plus, the fact that it links up to our accounting software and keeps track of sales on social media will be beyond helpful.” Having combined their years of experience in upholstery, vintage furniture sourcing, textiles and interior design, Ollie and Corinne are able to offer unique and exciting services and products to clients nationally, as well as in the south east. “We have a hands-on approach, working really closely with clients,” they explain. “We have a passion for restoring peopleaposs furniture and helping them craft homes that are a true reflection of our clientsapos tastes.”  With that in mind, Ollie and Corinne are looking to open a larger shop space, take on additional staff and signicantly expand their online presence. And the ability to upgrade the Square software and expand the Square services will make the management of these additional areas so much easier. “We are delighted to win this prize,” they told us. “Our previous POS was very basic and offered no integration with our online store and accounting software, so it will make such a dference having technology with the ability to grow with us.” aposWeaposre over the moon - Square’s architecture is easily scalableapos - Outdoor Fire Pits, Nottinghamshire Husband and we duo Tony and Kate Cox set up their business in  on the eve of Tonyaposs th and say winning our Square bundle will help them continue to grow. The business manufactures beautul, sturdy, steel outdoor fire pits and other steel items for the home and garden. Reacting to winning our prize, Tony said: Weaposre over the moon to have won.  Weaposre on the brink of taking on some staff to run our retail shop, which would mean investing in some permanent payment taking hardware, as to date, we’ve each had a card reader paired with our phone. The Square Register will give us that permanent asset which anyone who runs the shop can use without needing an app on their phone. Secondly, we’ve seen an increase in the number of people who ask to order and pay by phone, which is something missing from our current offering, which will be resolved by Square. Tony and Kateaposs business is booming and has come a long way in a short amount of time. Tony added: Five years ago, we started manufacturing in a tiny  square foot rented barn building, with a lot of time spent on design and selling a couple units per month. We then doubled the size of our space. During the  lockdown to keep up with growth, we successfully partnered with some local welding schools and have now negotiated new partnerships which have given us the capacity to supply a number of garden centres in addition to our own direct sales.

Amy, , and Alberto, , who have not revealed their surnames, from Chiswick in west London, flew straight out to Barbados three days after they married in Ireland on September . They say their PCR tests they took before leaving the country came back negative but on arrival at Bridgetown Airport they had to take another test, and were sent to a hotel to wait for their results to come through.Although Albertoaposs result ed negative, MyLondon reports there was no sign of Amyaposs results.At pm that day they got a phone call from the Barbados ministry of health telling them Amy had tested positive for Covid and had to be moved to a government isolation facility, they say.  For a few hours they heard nothing, then at pm they received a phone call saying Amy needed to be ready to leave with her belongings in  minutes. She was then escorted to the Blackman and Gollop isolation facility, a building normally used as a primary school, to stay there for  days. Alberto said: “She was so scared and was crying, it was horrible. I stayed on the phone with her all night because she was so worried.” Amy says she had to share a room with six other strangers - men, women and children. And there were no locks on the doors. The facility was fenced in so no one could escape. She claims she was allowed three bottles of water a day, there was no toilet paper, no pillows on the beds and only one thin sheet to sleep under. Alberto said: “I understand that the government is doing what they can because the covid situation out here is escalating very quickly.  But the way they handled things was awful and the facility is inhumane. It’s more like a jail. She says it feels like being in a zombie movie. Luckily the other residents have been nice to her and are playing games with her so she doesnapost feel so alone, which she really appreciates. The government facility was free but the couple decided to pay for Amy to be transferred to the only private isolation facility on the island. She has now moved there and gets to share a room with only one other person. Meanwhile Alberto has moved to the cheapest government approved flat where he is stuck in quarantine. The private facility is costing them  a night, as well as essential doctors fees, which cost  per visit, and covid tests that cost  per test - she needs at least two negative results to leave.  Amy and Alberto had already spent £ on flights and £ on hotels which they won’t be able to get refunded. “It’s gone from being the best few days of our lives and turned into a nightmare,” said Alberto. All of the money the couple got from wedding gts has been used to pay the cost of both of their covid accommodation and to get another flight back home.  The newly weds have used up all their holiday for work so will be straight back into work when they .To help with the unwanted costs to their holiday, Amy’s sister has set up afundraiser . She said: “Any help would be really appreciated, hopefully we can make Amy and Albertoaposs honeymoon somewhat special.”My London has contacted the Home Office and the Government of Barbados for comment.

When the photographer asked himhe was sure he didn’t want to take the mask off for just a couple of seconds, he replied: “No thank you, I always listen to my mom!” Nicole was even more impressed as her son had just lost four teeth within the last few weeks, so he was “so proud” of his smile. She said that the pair had spoken at the beginning of school about the importance of safety, and how easily germs can spread without a face covering.

The critically acclaimed original movie by James Wan was based on accounts taken from inhabitants of the fourteen-room farmhouse. The property has been listed by Rhode Island realtor Mott  Chace Sotheby, who claim it is “one of the most haunted houses in the United States”.Built in , the farmhouse is just over , square feet and boasts three bedrooms and one-and-a-half bathrooms, plus eight acres of land, WalesOnline reports. It is said to have been the home of Bathsheba Sherman, who lived in the house in the s, and who has never left the property. Bathsheba was accused of witchcraft by the local population after it was found her baby had died, with the cause of death stated as a large sewing needle impaled into the base of the skull, according to the website Screenrant. From this, rumours began that Bethsheba had murdered her child as an offering to Satan, but this was never proved. Many qualied paranormal researchers have been invited into the home – most famously Ed and Lorraine Warren, who founded the oldest ghost hunting team in New England. In the s, the Warrens were hired to rid the home of its evil and they have confirmed that the events depicted in The Conjuring movie franchise did transpire. At the time, the house was occupied by the Perron family, who bought the property in  and stayed at the property for about  years.  The listing reads: “To this day, countless happenings have been reported. “The chilling stories, incidents, and recollections of residents and visitors of the property have been told in dozens of media productions including books, movies, and television shows.” Currently, the full ing restored farmhouse in Harrisville is rented overnight to paranormal researchers, ghost hunters, and folks of the like.  The most recent owners have claimed to have experienced unusual goings-on themselves, including “doors opening and closing on their own, footsteps, knocking [and] disembodied voices”. “Last night, we had a black mist in one of the rooms,” Mr Heinzen told NBC ’ WJAR. “It looks like smoke.

A master suite stretches out over ,ft, which is in itself twice as large as the average American home. Security comes in the form of a moat. Fortunately for the eye wateringly rich person who ends up buying this massive property, itaposs likely to go for a discount.The home has been buried under millionof debts and loans, reports CNBC. LA billionaire Don Hankey is said to have loaned million to Nile Niami, who has worked on the property for more than seven years, but has served him with a default notice. As a result, Los Angeles County Superior Court will require the property to be sold at a signicantly discounted rate. Ted Lanes of Lanes Management, which is putting the final touches on the home, said: “What I would love to see happen is that the house gets completed, the certicate of occupancy is awarded and we have an orderly sale that maximises the value.  “Hopefully, there will be sufficient proceeds from the sale to fund the secured and unsecured creditors and for the equity to realize some value.” It is unclear how much the property will sell for, but itaposs likely to be less than Mr Niamiaposs bullish estimate last year. He said in an interview: “When you have something that’s as rare as the Mona Lisa, you can command whatever you want for it.” Eventhe property goes for half his initial estimate, then it will still be the most expensive home ever sold in America. That current honour belongs to a Manhattan penthouse bought by hedge fund billionaire Ken Grfin for million . Other particularly expensive homes include a £million mansion in Knightsbridge being eyed up by a Chinese tycoon, and a £million French chateau bought by a Saudi prince. As expansive and shiny as The One is, it may not prove to be the easiest home to sell. Property expert Jonathan Miller suggested that its unique features may deter rather than entice potential customers.  He told Bloomberg last year: “The problem is, the more amenities you add, the more you personalise the property. “Even though the intention is to draw eyeballs to the property, you are also personalising it, which may reduce the size of the market pie. It’s a very small, very tight market.” Such a small market has led to big discounts before, including a millionhome that eventually sold for millionin Bel-Air. Britainaposs most expensive home is said to be owned by Phones u founder John Caudwell, who turned two mansions in Mayfair into one mega-mansion. It is now thought to be worth £million.

The video – which was filmed in Dublin – shows one man in the home slowly lowering the sofa toward the ground, Dublin Live reports.The other two men were standing on a low wall outside the house, and were using sweeping brushes to hold up the sofa so it didn’t come crashing down.

They manage to lower the sofa to a height where it looks like they would be to take hold of the sofa, but viewers didn’t get to seethey were ultimately successful, as the video ends with the piece of furniture still dangling in the air. But despite the unsatisfactory ending, the video’s viewers were amazed by the strange technique. One wrote: “Masters at work, hopefully it was successful!” While another said: “It worked and saved hours because it obviously didn’t fit through a door, so they would have had to take it apart. They’re big brained.” And a third posted: “That was actually pretty fantastic.” Other people didn’t find the strategy to be that weird, as they shared similar stories of their own unique ways of getting large pieces of furniture in and out of a house with narrow doorways. Someone said: “My brother and I popped out his sitting room window out last September to swap the suites. Took  minutes and the window popped straight back in.” However, some were unimpressed, with one person writing: “At that stage itaposd nearly have been faster to carry it down the stairs.” While another complained: “It would have been easier to unscrew one of the arms off.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralTikTokUmm what Funny ha ha viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Peter Charleton won £k on the Tatts Lotto in Australia but said he did not feel comfortable with keeping the money for himself and gave it away to those struggling financially and emotionally. He said his aim was to get rid of the money before people realised he had won the Lottery and thought he was sitting on a goldmine. The Scottish Sun reports that Peter spoke as part of a news YouTube series called My Big Story and revealed that he had at first bought three tickets in memory of his late uncle Charlie who had passed away a short time before.He told how he had had a close bond with his uncle Charlie and they shared a bond over playing Lotto. He later said: Maybe uncle Charlie pulled some strings on his way out.  After the windfall, Peter reached out to friends, family members and even strangers to offer to put some money into their bank accounts. He said: My theory on it was that Iaposll share it around and once itaposs gone, itaposs gone. Rather than people thinking Iaposm sitting on my goldmine, I felt more comfortable knowing that I had given it all away. So my mission was to get rid of the money before they realised that Iaposd won the Lotto.

Eventually Peter widened his efforts and put , on local pizza restaurants on tabs for people to enjoy before he went to express checkouts at supermarkets, paying for peopleaposs shopping.

The caches - earmarked for US counter-terrorism “over the horizon” attacks against al-Qaeda and Islamic State - were hidden to help the US quickly attack terrorist organisations. Both warehouse-sized stores contained hundreds of thousands of bullets, heavy weapons, missiles, survival supplies and even spare helicopters parts.

They had been left there as a contingency against a terrorist resurgence across the region as US troops withdrew to Kabul and faced having no in-country base.

It sparked one of the biggest airlts out of a war-zone since the Vietnam war but left thousands of locals stranded in Afghanistan, facing a grim future. Taliban gunmen have launched door-to-door searches for people suspected of having worked with the west in  years of fighting.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people. Participants will discover traditional building skills, learn how to guide visitors, or #takeover# the social media accounts for a museum: all with the aim of improving their future employability.The project, which runs until May , has three main strands of work: providing work experience placements for young people aged - who will study for a Trinity College Arts Award accredited workshops and events and a series of school visits.For more information, contact project co-ordinators Kirsty MacNabat kirsty@chartsargyllandisles.org or Pamela Campbellat pamela@chartsargyllandisles.org.Seymour Adams, Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles Board"},{"url":null,"title":"fiona celebrates double wins","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLochgilphead golfer Fiona McLeod completed a unique double, winning Dunaverty Golf Club#s R.N.L.I Open Event with a net score of .Fiona#s victory added to her previous success in winning Dunty#s Holiday Open back in July with a net score of .

St Peter#sSt Peter#s win - on penaltiesRed Star welcomed St Peter#s to the Ropework last Saturday for their Scottish Cup first round tie and were disappointed to exit the competition after an even contest ended - after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs next month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"new love local

At times, such was the turmoil and ineptitude on display, you would not have left this crew in charge of a rubber duck, never mind a nuclear-powered submarine.Precision was not the point though, this being a piece of fiction. In its favour, Tom Edgersquos drama had a solid gold cast and a strongoccasionally baffling script .Above all, Vigil had pluck and ambition. While this was a tale made for the small screen, the action scenes could have passed muster in a cinema.: No Line of Duty but Jones makes impactWhen we left Amy Silvaat the end of episode it looked as though the jig was up for the DCI.Lamped by a sonar operator who turned out to be an agent for the Russkies, Amy had been stuffed in the same kind of missile casing that had been Martin Compstonrsquos home for the past five weeks. She would have been a goner in the first ten minutessomeone had not walked in on the villain just in time. A lot of that went on in the final hour.Entombed in a tube, all Amy could do was scream for help and think back to the love she had driven away, fellow copper Kirsten , and the daughter who had lost her fatherin a car accident.Eventually, Amy remembered she knew Morse code. As luck would have it, there was someone in the control room who could interpret the messageand with one bound, and a quick vomit, Amy was free to nick the villain.But she had to avoid him killing her first. The chase through the submarine was heart in the mouth stuff, the corridors bathed in red, lights fizzing and flashing.Amy, lithe and muscular, sweating for Scotland in her vest, looked positively Ripleyesque as she hunted the alien presence in her midst.Meanwhile, water was pouring into the boat courtesy of the bad guyrsquos earlier handiwork - he had been a very busy boy - and HMS Vigil was heading for Davy Jonesrsquo locker. The unluckiest submarine in the world looked to be about to meet its fate.But onboard and on shore, the women were not going to let that happen. Though men were predominant, especially at the boss level, it was women who made the key moves, much as in Line of Duty .The men squared off and honour was saved, the anti-Trident MP agreeing to keep quiet ldquothis time. Not before he had a mini rant about getting nukes out of Scotland within his letime, however.It had all been a Russian plot to make the nukes in Scotland seem unsafe and steer MPs into cancelling a replacement deterrent, which sounded a bit rum. Who was to say it would not have had the opposite effect : Was Vigil filmed on a submarine There was no time to worry about any of that because there was hair to be stroked and a relationship to repair.

The impact on the unemployment rate could be +.%. In Glasgow this would equate to a loss of pound.m per annum and the loss of  jobs.Graeme Blackett of BiGGAR Economics agrees there is no question that the lack of housing is an issue for the Scottish economy but pointed out that it is a problem for every advanced economy, even those where the tourism sector is not as large as it is in Scotland.ldquoThat suggests tourism is not the main driver of the housing problem, he said. ldquoThe consensus amongst most economists is that there is not enough supply ndash we donrsquot build enough houses - so regulations are not going to solve the problem.Mr Blackett said any regulations would come with a cost.ldquoThey donrsquot exist yet so it is not possible to be certain about the effects, but we can look at how such things affect the economy to give us some sort of guidance andit puts up prices, which it is likely to do, you would expect that to reduce demand.ldquoThe other consequence you would expect to happenthere is a regulation system is that it will put off some hosts.He said some would be likely to question whether the regulation was worth spending money on while others might be put off by the ldquohassle of going through the process.ldquoIf there is a reduction in demand and a reduction in properties there will be fewer visitors staying in Airbnb which means there will be less money spent in the economy by guests and Hosts, said Mr Blackett.ldquoIf you do something that impacts on prices then it will have an economic effect. It does not really matter how much it is as any sort of cost will increase prices. Any regulation will have a cost and that will feed its way through and the question is whether people will think that cost is worth it.ldquoIt might be thata price goes up by % it will make no dference to most people but it will to some and they wonrsquot come any more so you will see the effect in terms of lower demand.Mr Blackett said people would either not come at all or would have less money to spend in local shops, restaurants and businesses because they were spending more of it on accommodation as they would be paying indirectly for the regulation.ldquoThe key point about the report is it provides some evidence of what the consequences would be of less activity, he said. ldquoIt is then up to the people who are proposing and voting on the legislation to look at the downside as well as whatever problem they hope to solve so they can balance those things and decide whether it is a sensible thing to do.Under the new proposals, short-term lets, hosts may have to pay almost pound, just to comply with new regulations, making it the most expensive short-term lets regime in Europe.Hosts might also face costly home alterations, such as replacing wooden floors with lino.ldquoContrary to popular myth, Airbnb is actually a strong advocate for sensible proportionate regulation and has entered into over  tax and regulatory agreements worldwide so this is not new to us, said Amanda Cupples, Airbnb General Manager for Northern Europe.ldquoHowever these proposals are among the strictest in the world and incredibly costly. The majority of Hosts on Airbnb in Scotland actually share their own home and the average earnings per year are around pound. However the regulations as drafted mean that whether you share your spare room for one night or your entire property, you need to apply for a licence that could cost you up to pound. This is really disproportionate. In this post-pandemic phase, a lot of Hosts on Airbnb rely on that additional income to make ends meet so we want to do the right thing by them.As well as being in favour of registration for those letting out their properties, Airbnb has a neighbourhood support hotline and a range of other tools available to local authorities and communities to help them manage tourism.*BiGGAR Economics Report ldquoScottish  Local Tourism Economic Impact Assessment, October , commissioned by Airbnb.This article is brought to you in partnership with Airbnb."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13051728.jpg?type=article-full","title":"historic-scots-venue-remains-shut-six-years-delayed-15m-refurb","story":"In its heydey, the unique example of rsquos seaside architecture was enjoyed by tens of thousands of tourists from home and abroad who sailed ldquodoon the watter for summer sunshine on the Isle of Bute.The Rothesay Pavilion, designed by James Carrick in  is regarded as one of the finest examples in Scotland of the international modernist style. Some say it has earned a place alongside acknowledged Scottish architectural icons, including Butersquos gothic mansion Mount Stuart House and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.But it has been shut for six years and a re-opening has been limbo for over two years as the process of restoration toit to its s Art Deco glory has stalled over and over again.In the meantime the costs have nearly doubled from initial estimates of poundm.It had been announced in  that that the ldquojewel in Butersquos heritage would re-open its doors in the summer of the same year.The plan was to turn it into a cultural and community hub, with the aim of creating a tourism attraction for Bute and the wider area, with organisers saying it would be a ldquosignicant catalyst for regeneration and change on the island.When complete, it was to see the creation of four separate spaces: a main hall capable of seating up to  people a self-contained studio theatre space for  a flexible exhibition area and a unique glazed top floor with spectacular views for weddings and other bespoke events.But the refurbishment of the building, which has been exposed to the salty air of the Firth of Clyde since opening in  and was placed on the ldquobuildings at risk register in , has since been dogged by issues as a result of weather, construction issues, the insolvency of a contractor and the pandemic.Now the container ship that caused global disruption after blocking the Suez canal earlier this year has been identied as one of the factors which could further hold up the completion of Rothesayrsquos new Pavilion.Argyll and Bute Councilrsquos deputy leader Gary Mulvaney has said in a report that work remains ongoing to ensure that the building can safely be finished.While the Rothesay Pavilion website indicates a re-opening this year - the council before the concerns about the container ship estimated it would not be completed until the summer of next year.Mr Mulvaney has indicated that there could be even more delays, as there are issues because the construction industry was facing ldquounprecedented pressures through the Covid- pandemic.The blockage of the Suez Canal in March,eof the biggest traffic jams in shipping history was also a factor as it delayed the delivery of materials.In May, last year, the resurrection of the Pavilion hit a major blow after Central Building Contractors, the main builders on the poundm project went ito administration.And so far there has been no sign of replacement contractors to carry the work through.Before that the council, which owns the building said attempts to open in the summer of  were put back because a month before it was due to open its doors it emerged that only  per cent of the work had been completed.Project manager Jonathan Miles said it was primarily caused due to works including undercroft excavation, roof replacement, cast stone repairs and cast stone coping replacement, not having progressed as swtly as thought due to weather and \"complexity challenges\".He said that despite the main contractorsrsquo best endeavours, maintaining the water tightness and integrity of the structure had been \"challenging\".There was also concern that asbestos in the existing main hall ceiling was in a far worse condition than surveys led the council to believe.Mr Mulvaney, who is the councils policy lead for financial services and major projects said they had been involved in detailed negotiations with a major construction contractor to take on the rest of the work.\"Our initial engagement with them has enabled their appointment to undertake lsquopreconstruction activitiesrsquo. This is where they will work closely with our inhouse team and our design consultants to further develop our specic technical and contractual requirements for completing the refurbishment of the Rothesay Pavilion,\" he said.ldquoThe construction sector globally is facing unprecedented pressures arising due to a number of factors including the Covid pandemic and the recent blockage of the Suez Canal which, taken in combination, have impacted upon the availability and material and transportation costs for core construction resources, materials, plant and equipment.He added: \"As part of the pre-construction activities, the preferred contractor is undertaking an extensive market engagement exercise with its established supply chain, such that later this year it will be able to submit to us its price and programme of activities to complete the works.\"In July, , Rothesay Pavilion had a video created as part of a countdown to re-opening.The Pavilion, while having played host to seaside entertainment shows such as wrestling and the Miss Rotheseay pageant, in more recent times played host to bands such as the acclaimed Scots post-rock band Mogwai.The council felt that the relaunch would play a pivotal role in the islandrsquos economic regeneration and social inclusion initiatives through increased tourism and an elevated national and international profile.Ambitions for future programming include artistic collaborations and accessible community workshops, offering wide appeal across generational boundaries and erse cultural tastes.It aimed to host national and international music, comedy, theatre and dance acts, as well as showing major exhibitions of history, photography and visual arts."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September ,  at : amA major Scottish consortium has announced a bid for an offshore wind project west of Orkney.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

We now want to capture the experiences of all local dog owners so we can build a picture of dog ownership today and what more Dogs Trust can do to help them and their dogs.“This will be the most comprehensive census of dogs and dog lovers ever completed and we would love iteveryone who is passionate about dogs could do their bit to help our four-legged friends of the future have the best lives possible.“What people tell us today will help us make sure we are able to do everything we can to support dogs and their owners for the next  years and more.”For more information and to take part in the National Dog Survey, visit www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk Dog owners who complete the survey will get tailored behaviour advice sent direct to them.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFirst Minister Paul Givan. Credit: Liam McBurney PADavid YoungSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Executive has decided to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and some other indoor settings in Northern Ireland. At a meeting on Monday night, ministers decided to remove the one-metre distance requirement for the retail sector, indoor attractions and seated indoor venues.However, ministers were split on vaccine certication and over guidance to business and venue owners to mitigate the impact of allowing ato full capacity.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood accused the DUP and Sinn Fein of making an “astounding and reckless” decision to oppose moves to introduce certication in light of winter pressures on health services. First Minister Paul Givan tweeted: “Progress made after a constructive meeting of the Executive to remove social distancing requirements for indoor seated venues, indoor visitor attractions and retail settings.“Guidance will be provided for measures that can be taken to mitigate risk.”The measures are to take effect from pm on Thursday. Further consideration is to be given to the hospitality sector on October .The Executive said that despite the social distancing requirement being removed, “we would ask people to keep close face to face contact to a minimum at all times”.An Executive statement said: “The Executive has today considered the existing regulations and has agreed to remove the legal requirement to socially distance in retail and indoor visitor attractions.“We ask that those responsible for these venues, and those attending them, continue to utilise all other available mitigations such as hand sanitising, good ventilation, and using one way systems where possible. The wearing of a face covering remains a legal requirement in these settings.“The Executive has also decided to remove the requirement to socially distance in indoor seated venues such as theatres, concert halls and cinemas.”The advice includes the installation of screening, one-way systems and increased ventilation. Ministers will issue additional guidance to indoor seated venues advising that they introduce entry policies that require proof of either Covid- vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or evidence of a positive PCR test within the previous six months.However, ministers were split on this. The SDLP’s Nichola Mallon opposed the move to only advise that indoor seated venues ask for Covid certication or negative lateral flow test result or proof of infection in the last six months.Ms Mallon proposed that the steps be mandatory. She also wanted the measure beefed up to mean patrons had to show vaccine certication and a negative lateral flow test or proof of infection in the last six months.Alliance Justice Minister Naomi Long supported this but the other ministers, including Health Minister Robin Swann, voted against it.When it came to the vote on the original proposal to make the recommendations in guidance only, Ms Mallon voted against and Ms Long abstained. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood said: “It is astounding and reckless that DUP and Sinn Féin Ministers have kicked the can down the road instead of bringing certainty and clarity.“Their decision not to put vaccine certications in regulation but instead to remove social distancing requirements and advise businesses to opt in is totally irresponsible. Not only does this offer no incentive for vaccination, it puts the onus entirely on businesses themselves. This is a cop out and another failure of leadership.”Ministers will not consider social distancing in the hospitality sector until next week. Four further deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid- were reported here on Monday, along with  new confirmed cases.Related topicsSDLPSinn FéinColum EastwoodNichola MallonPaul GivanAlliance PartyNaomi LongRobin SwannMore On SDLP PremiumViewpointOpinionPacts feed into the democratic deficitCoveney set to be sent to Northern Ireland centenary church service in Armagh PremiumDUP at : Started off as a protest party before becoming part of the political establishment, but is it now turning full circle Derry GP handed -month suspension over Covid misinformation PremiumSDLP delays annual conference as Covid rates remain highMost ReadFuel crisis: Asda imposes £ cap at  NI filling stationsVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yours‘You’re Rory f**king McIlroy’: Shane Lowry reveals Ryder Cup blast that inspired Holywood star’s singles winSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsTop VideosPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest CoronavirusRight move, now back us: Social distancing move welcomed but some feel left in ‘no-man’s land’Lisa SmythOpinionMore mixed messaging and confusion when a strong public health message is necessaryMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSwann calls for vaccine passports to be ‘on the books’ as four deaths and , cases reportedRevealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchLatestIan Baraclough opens up on Northern Ireland contract hopes as boss aims to take new team to major tournamentGood Doctor star Freddie Highmore: I have married a ‘wonderful woman’Today#s headlines: PPS accused of ‘not caring about women’ as judge blasts ‘inept’ prosecutors in case of man who stabbed partner in head three timesFoxtons agrees to cut executive bonuses following shareholder backlashKatie Price’s fiance will ‘always be there’ for TV star following car crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

DfI officials warned at the time that four council areas here are facing delays in repairs that could stretch into January of next year.Ulster Unionist infrastructure spokesperson Roy Beggs said the claims figures represent a failure of public services and policies.There have been years of under-investment on maintaining our roads. Regular resurfacing or road maintenance would be a much better use of public funds rather than having to continually pay compensation for maintenance negligence in addition to expensive repeated patching and pothole repairs, he said.“Our roads resurfacing budget needs to be increased. We need to refocus our road capital investment into maintaining our existing network rather than continuing to build new roads which we then cannot afford to maintain.”DfI said it continues to inspect roads routinely on a cyclical basis. It said: Any defects identied during these inspections, which meet current intervention criteria levels will be scheduled for repair on a prioritised basis in accordance with the Department’s current road maintenance standards.“Earlier this year the Minister announced her high level budget commitments for the new financial year which included a capital investment of £.m in our road network. This included £m funding for the Roads Recovery Fund which will be used to address areas of greatest need across the road network, of which £m is specically directed towards rural roads.“There has been historical under-investment in the maintenance of our road network for a signicant number of years and many rural roads in particular are in need of repairs. Minister has therefore increased the Rural Roads allocation for the current year to £m from £n in   representing a % budget increase, reflecting her commitment to continue this important work to benefit rural communities.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsRoy Beggs Jr.Andrew MuirDepartment for InfrastructureMore On Roy Beggs Jr. PremiumStormont’s gang of seven: MLAs elected to the first Assembly in  who have stayed the course, NI road repairs waiting to be done as officials blame coronavirus for lack of action, wait over  hours in Northern Ireland AE - almost double last yearRoy Beggs: #Peter Robinson once referred to me as a loathsome creature.

I’m thinking about it...”The paucity of new cars is a result of the global shortage of semiconductors which began in the first quarter of this year and has halted assembly lines around the world.Many motorists, meanwhile, are changing cars with the money saved from not getting away on expensive family holidays during the Covid- pandemic.In some cases, six-month-old cars with , miles on the clock are changing hands for more than they would cost new.Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist, told the Belfastthat the used car market has been affected by a double whammy of a slump in available stock and a surge in prices.“UK new car registrations recorded their slowest August in eight years with sales down % compared to August last year, and it’s a similar story in Northern Ireland,” he said.“Local dealers had their worst August since the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Tradersseries began, with sales down % year-on-year and were one-fth lower than pre-pandemic levels in August .“During the first eight months of the year there were fewer than , new cars sold.“That may be % higher than last year, but it is over , fewer thanthe corresponding period in .”Mr Ramsey said the undersupply of new cars has continued to reduce the flow of stock into the used car market here.“For example, in  there were , new cars sold in Northern Ireland,” he said.“This fell by % year-on-yearto less than , in  with the latter marking a series low for new car sales locally.“Strong demand and limited supply are pushing prices higher. Indeed, UK second-hand car prices jumped by .% year on year in August.”Parkers, the popular online car price guide, researched how much the price of several three-year-old cars with , miles on the clock had increased since February this year – a time when second-hand vehicles would normally depreciate in price by around %It found that a Toyota Auris hybrid had gone up %, from £, to £, Mazda MX- .% from £, to £, Mercedes C-Class Cabriolet .% from £, to £, Vauxhall Mokka .% from £, to £,.Meanwhile, second hand Toyota Yaris GRs – which are listed at £,. new – have been advertised online for over £,.Another online seller was asking £, for six-month-old Dacia Sandero – £,. more than the price of buying a new one.It’s clear that,you own a car you don’t need – perhaps due to working from home instead of the office – now would be a good time to sell.It will only benefit you, however,you don’t want a replacement – which will also have cost a lot more than it did six months ago..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Read MoreSam McBride:OpinionJournalists want to bring the public the truth... but they need help to do it and it’s vital that Northern Ireland’s defamation law is changedMost ReadFuel crisis: Asda imposes £ cap at  NI filling stationsVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yours‘You’re Rory f**king McIlroy’: Shane Lowry reveals Ryder Cup blast that inspired Holywood star’s singles winSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsTop VideosPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest Northern IrelandToday#s headlines: PPS accused of ‘not caring about women’ as judge blasts ‘inept’ prosecutors in case of man who stabbed partner in head three timesStep up patrols in Northern Ireland, worried young people urge police after Sabina Nessa’s murder… ‘Every woman I’ve spoken to doesn’t feel safe’Parents of Fermanagh man who took his own le over gambling launch charity… ‘We don’t want anyone to go through pain we’ve had’‘Finn’s Law’ Bill to be brought before MLAs this autumnFailure to properly investigate murder of Martin O’Hagan a ‘stain’ on Northern Ireland policingLatestIan Baraclough opens up on Northern Ireland contract hopes as boss aims to take new team to major tournamentGood Doctor star Freddie Highmore: I have married a ‘wonderful woman’Today#s headlines: PPS accused of ‘not caring about women’ as judge blasts ‘inept’ prosecutors in case of man who stabbed partner in head three timesFoxtons agrees to cut executive bonuses following shareholder backlashKatie Price’s fiance will ‘always be there’ for TV star following car crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCouncil to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsGuest Column: The Obvious solution to tackling overcrowding on Derry- Belfast rail service overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derryrsquos AMH providing vital support to those suffering with ill mental healthDerry News“I just feel like you leave here and your heart is lighter.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs.

The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

ONEILLS DERRY SFC ROUND  Slaughtneil -Swatragh - The -point winning margin saw Paul Bradleys side finish in second spot behind Lavey, with the Davitts dropping to third on score dference.With ongoing maintenance on their main pitch at Davitt Park, Swatragh have been playing on their training pitch and while it was in pristine condition, its tight confines made it dficult to find space.Swatragh were more aggressive on their press and limited Antoacutein McMullan to just one short kick-out and a  percent first-half retention rate. A possession won by Fionnbharr McGuigan was the only break won with the rest coming from frees awarded for pushes in a congested middle third.At the other end, Sean McNicholl had marginally more freedom and kicked excellently throughout, losing just two kick-outs over the hour.Kevin Madden handed Michael Friel a first start of the championship and stationed him at corner forward, where he was picked up by Brendan Rogers. Karl McKaigue went across to Francis Kearney, with Peadar Kearney on Fintan McGurk.Oisin McWilliams wore number , but started at midfield where Chrissy McKaigue lined up against him. In the reshuffle, Cahal Murray started at centre forward where he pulled to the wings and the centre of Slaughtneils defence was manned by the rotation of Patsy Bradley and Padraig Cassidy.It left Slaughtneil needing a high concentration level to balance a compact centre with Cassidy getting forward to punch holes in Swatraghs defence. Brendan Rogers also had a major impact on the game and got forward at every opportunity.At the other end, Sean Francis Quinn picked up Christopher Bradley, who played slightly ahead of Shane McGuigan and Brian Cassidy. Sean Tad Cassidy and Seaacuten Oacute Caiside were alternating on Slaughtneils right wing against James Kearney and Niall Coyle. Oacute Caiside was later forced off with a suspected torn cruciate ligament injury.On the other wing, Keelan Feeney got on enough ball to keep Sean Martin Quinn out of the game. His case wasnt helped by not having a gumshield and Barry Cassidy let him re-enter the fray with one in situ.Feeney and McGrath combined on the left wing for Shane McGuigan to get a run on Diarmuid Dillon and fist over the first score of the game and the Emmets doubled their lead with a confident Sammy Bradley point at the end of a Rogers foray upfield.Midway through the first-half, a McMullan kick-out was punched back into the Slaughtneil defence where Chrissy McKaigue saw black for taking down the galloping Oisin McWilliams.Three minutes later a Diarmuid Dillon body check on Brian Cassidy also saw him in the sin-bin and it opened the game up.A close-range Meehaul McGrath goal after the water break put Slaughtneil - to - ahead. After Rogers and Padraig Cassidy ran at the Swatragh defence, McGrath was calm enough to sidestep in a crowded penalty area before slotting to the net.Slaughtneils game of closing down the midfield involved players dropping off to the closest man, but when Sean Cassidy lost his footing Sean Francis Quinn came forward to kick a point with the outside of his right boot.Peadar Kearney, who escaped an earlier yellow card, was walking a fine line after another foul on Fintan McGurk who was Swatraghs most potent forward. James Kearney missed the free, but when Conor McAtamney won the next kick-out, McGurk went through to make it a three-point game, - to -.The Swa then had a goal chance, started by Francis Kearney and involving McGurk, that saw Kearneys low shot blocked by the feet of Rogers. Oisin McWilliams and Francis Kearneyalso missed chances to eat into the lead before half-time.Friel started the second-half at centre-forward and after an early Christopher Bradley wide, Francis Kearney hit Swatraghs only point of the second-half from a free.Seven minutes into the half, a well-worked move involving Rogers, McGrath and Sammy Bradley saw Shane McGuigan in on goal, where he was fouled and referee Cassidy awarded a penalty. Sean McNicholl saved McGuigans first attempt, but only into the Slaughtneil man path and he finished the rebound to the net.McNicholl worked the kick-out short and an Oisin McWilliams run up the right flank pulled Slaughtneil out of position and when the ball was squared, Cahal Murray palmed to the net at the far post, making the score - to - in the visitors favour after  minutes.Swatragh had a spell with the McWilliams twins inside, but Murrays goal was their last score of the game. With limited space, the diagonal ball wasnt an option and anytime it was played in straight, Rogers was able to come from behind to turnover the ball.McMullan was able to poke some of his kick-outs to Feeney and slowly but surely Slaughtneil got a firm grip on the game. Rogers got forward to kick a point, followed by a Christopher Bradley point after Seacute and Shane McGuigan linked up on the left wing.When Francis Kearney kicked the ball over the sideline, and with Swatraghs defence open, Cormac ODohertys cross field ball found the run of Shane McGuigan who thumped the ball high, confidently and straight between the posts for a - to - lead to rubber-stamp Slaughtneils rampant third quarter.With the eight point winning margin in sight and with the game firmly in their clutches, Slaughtneil hit five unanswered points in the final  minutes on their way to a commanding win. googletag.cmd.push SLAUGHTNEIL: Antoacutein McMullan Peadar Kearney, Karl McKaigue, Brendan RogersSeaacuten Oacute Caiside, Padraig Cassidy, Keelan Feeney Patsy Bradley, Chrissy McKaigue Sean Cassidy, Cormac ODoherty, Meehaul McGrathChristopher BradleyShane McGuigan , Brian CassidySUBS: Fionnbharr McGuigan for S Oacute Caiside , Seacute McGuiganfor B Cassidy , Francis McEldowney for P Kearney , Ronan Bradley for M McGrath BLACK CARD: C McKaigue YELLOW CARD: P Bradley  SWATRAGH: Sean McNicholl Aaron McGuckin, Diarmuid Dillon Sean Francis QuinnBrian Diamond, Tiarnaacuten Walsh, Niall Coyle Conor McAtamney, Oisin McWilliams Sean Martin Quinn, Cahal Murray , James KearneyMichael Friel, Francis Kearney , Fintan McGurk SUBS: Lorcan McWilliams for J Kearney , Patrick Turner for B Diamond , Liam Kearney for N Coyle , Niall McAtamney for C Murray BLACK CARD: D Dillon YELLOW CARDS: M Friel , O McWilliams  REF: Barry Cassidy     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCouncil to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsGuest Column: The Obvious solution to tackling overcrowding on Derry- Belfast rail service overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derryrsquos AMH providing vital support to those suffering with ill mental healthDerry News“I just feel like you leave here and your heart is lighter.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCouncil to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsGuest Column: The Obvious solution to tackling overcrowding on Derry- Belfast rail service overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derryrsquos AMH providing vital support to those suffering with ill mental healthDerry News“I just feel like you leave here and your heart is lighter.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Speaking after last week’s event, Kathryn Hill, Director of Active Communities in the Department for Communities commented:     “I was delighted to have been invited along today to join in celebrating the launch of the Churches Trust’s Community of Homes, Creativity and Wellbeing book. “The Department has funded the Community of Homes project in recent years though our Together: Building a United Community Uniting Opportunities grant scheme, a good relations programme delivered through the medium of sport, physical and creative activity. “This project has engaged young people in a unique range of creative activities that brings communities together, addresses barriers to participation and increases social skills. “I want to thank Fiona and the Churches Trust for successfully delivering this project and most importantly the young people that have taken part.” Showcase Wednesday’s book launch also included the showcasing of seven youth projects involving over  young people each year from local schools, churches and communities. Many of the youth project are structured using the creative pathways: all projects are underpinned by good relations, personal development and skills development. Projects range from ongoing one-to-one mentoring programmes, to summer camps, to small groups working on themed ad hoc projects and to larger groups who engage in three-six month programmes. Speakers at the event included the Mayor, Graham Warke Kathryn Hill, Department for Communities, artist Sinead Smyth, Faustina Starrett, North West Regional College, and the Churches Trust’s own Catherine Coyle who delivered an address on the success of the four year programme.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCouncil to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsGuest Column: The Obvious solution to tackling overcrowding on Derry- Belfast rail service overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derryrsquos AMH providing vital support to those suffering with ill mental healthDerry News“I just feel like you leave here and your heart is lighter.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

However, Mr Durkan noted his disappointment that the Bill as it currently stands fails to protect people vulnerable to gambling related harm. He has demanded regulation both North and South to protect , problem gamblers. googletag.cmd.push Speaking ahead of the Second Stage of the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill, the Foyle MLA said: “Gambling addiction has been a scourge within our communities. “It has destroyed iniduals and their families with its far-reaching implications – not just the financial impact but the toll this addiction has on people’s mental health, wellbeing and the hold it can take over lives. “While I welcome steps taken to address gambling related harm within the gambling legislation, it’s clear that it falls short of what is needed and does little to protect vulnerable people here. “The North has the highest rates of problem gamblers across the islands – it is critical that gambling laws now are as robust as they need to be.” Mr Durkan also hit out at Sinn Feacutein for not pushing the same line in the North as they have done in the Republic. He added: “This issue is not isolated to the North but rather is a problem for the whole of this island. “I note with interest that Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeys own party has contributed to a similar debate in the Daacuteil calling for all the bells and whistles we would like to have seen within this legislation in a  counties ‘Gambling Strategy’: a gambling regulator, online regulation and self-exclusion regulation.     “My question is, why has Minister Hargey opted to deviate from Sinn Feacutein policy here in the North  Surely, we should be pushing for an all-island strategy. We desperately need regulation both North and South. “The Minister and by extension the Executive cannot run the risk of missing the opportunity now to implement a fit for purpose gambling strategy when given the chance.”  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCouncil to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsGuest Column: The Obvious solution to tackling overcrowding on Derry- Belfast rail service overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derryrsquos AMH providing vital support to those suffering with ill mental healthDerry News“I just feel like you leave here and your heart is lighter.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Chair and Deputy Chair of the Councils Planning Committee, Cllrs Kyle Black and Sean McPeake, have written to DfI after aspecial meeting of the Planning Committee agreed that the new ‘Planning Advice Note for Development in the Countryside’ would have serious ramications for rural communities and the Council’s ability to make planning decisions which accommodate rural dwellings. googletag.cmd.push The issue centres on a new definition of buildings which can be taken into consideration when assessing a planning application for development on a farm and proposes that a group of buildings which include a house and domestic garage should not be included. The new policy advice would, according to the Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Kyle Black, be so restrictive as to prevent many people from getting a perfectly sustainable rural dwelling: “In Mid Ulster, the proportion of new dwellings allowed in the countryside is lower than the proportion of people living in the countryside, he said. “There is no need, therefore, to place any additional limitations on development in rural areas. “In fact, I would argue that there is a need to explore policy to provide additional sustainable opportunities for Mid Ulster’s existing rural dwellers. “This policy would effectively tie our hands when it comes to making decisions tailored to, and based on, the needs of local people, which is what the transfer of planning powers to local council was all about”.     Deputy Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Sean McPeake, said the area had the space required. “While other councils may face pressures in terms of accommodating rural development, we in Mid Ulster have the capacity to absorb new dwellings, he said. “To address the issue with a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate, reasonable or fair. “We are also concerned that the guidance could prejudice our ability to progress our Draft Local Development Plan which has been, rightly, developed to ensure that we take account of the very specic planning needs of our rural communities”. A letter has been issued to the Minister detailing the Committee’s objections and asking her to withdraw the planning advice guidance.

Councillor McGlinchey made the comments last night , three days after a continuous lane closure was put in place at Chapel Road, Dungiven. Temporary traffic lights have been operating since Friday, September  and are expected to be in place until Friday, October  to facilitate work as part of the bypass of Dungiven town. googletag.cmd.push As a result of the lane closure, there has been y tailbacks in both directions, something which Councillor McGlinchey says must end. Fridays Derry intermediate football championship clash between Steelstown and Ballymaguigan was scheduled for pm at Derry GAAs Centre of Excellence in Dungiven, but county officials were forced to delay the throw-in by  minutes as Ballymaguigan supporters, players and match officials were caught up in the tailback. Lavey supporters attending their clubs senior championship clash  with Claudy, also on Friday night, missed part of the first half, with the roadworks also causing their delay in getting to Banagher. “The long delays are totally unacceptable and just not good enough,” said Councillor McGlinchey. “People living in Magherabuoy, Traceys Way, Abbey Fields and Glenroe Park cannot get in and out of their homes because of the traffic and drivers blocking the entrances to the estates. “Our party met with the Department for Infrastructure six months ago and asked them to come back and complete the roundabout at a later date. The contractor, Wills Bros, have been very accomodating but it is the Department for Infrastructure and the client Aecom that need to make the decision.” Councillor McGlinchey said the long delays are also having a major impact on local businesses in Dungiven.     “People are avoiding stopping at local shops because of the long delays in traffic and these businesses are missing out even though there is a simple solution,” he said, adding that his party colleague, MLA Caoimhe Archibald has called for an urgent meeting with DfI and Aecom to discuss the issues. “We are asking the Department and client Aecom to intervene as this cannot continue. A common sense approach is needed here and I will be calling on these roadworks to be suspended until such times as a solution is found.” Last night, a DfI spokesperson said: “The Department can confirm that Caoimhe Archibald MLA has todayrequested a meeting to discuss the roadworks at Dungiven. “The Department has been engaging with local representatives and has received positive feedback on this engagement.

The representative for the Sperrin ward was commenting ahead of Thursdays meeting of Derry  Strabane Council where Sinn Feacutein intend to table a motion calling for social care reform. googletag.cmd.push Ms Boyle said that staff shortages and the need for fairer wages that cover travel costs and a lack of pathways for career progression were putting additional pressure on staff and patients. Cllr. Boyle said: “No one doubts there are massive pressures and challenges facing our social care system which is impacting on the ability to deliver high quality domiciliary care within the community. “That was true before the pandemic but has been greatly exacerbated over the past  months. “There are major problems over a lack of workforce planning, leading to staff shortages and high vacancy rates which in turn puts additional pressure on staff, service users and their families. “There is a clear need to improve the terms and conditions of domiciliary care staff, including rates of pay, covering travel costs, and providing career progression pathways. “All that is vitalwe are to ensure that the social care system is fit for purpose now and into the future so that those who need care are properly looked after and staff are properly valued. “To that end, I hope that all parties can support my motion at the full council meeting as it will call on the Western Health and Social Care Trust to provide us with a detailed briefing on the current position regarding social care.     “We are also calling on the Minister of Health to outline his plans to reform adult social care, including a detailed report into the true cost of delivering all aspects of the necessary changes.” In response, Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed his intention to launch a public consultation on reforming adult social care. The consultation will begin later this year. The Minister stated: “I am on record as describing Northern Ireland’s social care system as not fit for purpose. “This was also a central conclusion of the independent Power to People review commissioned by the Department of Health and published in late . “We need to increase the quantity of social care to meet growing demand, we need to improve the quality of social care so that people can live with dignity and independence and we need a fair and equitable answer to the questions of who pays and what and when they pay. “We also need to do right by those hard working and dedicated people who work in this sector, often for minimum wage and in some cases, in real terms, even less than minimum wage. “These are not new challenges though the need to address them becomes more pressing with every day. Solving them will not be easy or cheap which is why they have unfortunately been kicked down the road time after time. That has to stop. “I will be launching a public consultation on reforming social care in Northern Ireland later this year. Options to be addressed in this consultation will include introducing a cap on care costs incurred by iniduals, but this cannot be looked at in isolation from the need to signicantly increase investment. “Reforming social care is one of the biggest and most important issues facing Government. I am looking forward to a wide ranging and informed public discussion on how best to get it right.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCouncil to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsGuest Column: The Obvious solution to tackling overcrowding on Derry- Belfast rail service overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derryrsquos AMH providing vital support to those suffering with ill mental healthDerry News“I just feel like you leave here and your heart is lighter.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

The call comes from SDLP Foyle MLA Sineacutead McLaughlin who was speaking after being told by Health Minister Robin Swann that the local service was under serious pressure,to the point that thealready long waiting list to access contraception through the Family Planning Service was closed to new appointments. googletag.cmd.push Ms McLaughlin said: “Several constituents contacted me to complain about delays in accessing contraception servicesthrough the Family Planning Service. In his answer to my written question, health minister Swann revealedthat people in Derry are at a signicant disadvantage compared to people in other areas in the North when it comes to accessing this essential healthcare service. “While I am pleased the Western Trust was able to start accepting new clients from July this year, I am very concerned at the impact of waiting for access toa full range of contraceptive options. “These need to be accessible to all who need them, when they need them. “I have also written to Health Minister Swann to ask whether his department has any strategy in place to tackle this issue and whether he will commit to making the necessary funding available to ensure there are enough staff to meet demand and reduce waiting times for an appointment. While I realise the Western Trust is dealing with a range of dficult challenges, including staff shortages, it must recognise that access to contraception can be essential in avoiding unintended pregnancies and the personal crisis this can cause.     “Not only do my constituents deserve improved access to the full range of healthcare services, but increased investment in contraception has been demonstrated to save public money in the long term.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Constable Michael Ferguson, , was shot dead in Derry in January, .DerryNowMan arrested in Derry for  murder of policeman Michael Ferguson overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCouncil to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsGuest Column: The Obvious solution to tackling overcrowding on Derry- Belfast rail service overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derryrsquos AMH providing vital support to those suffering with ill mental healthDerry News“I just feel like you leave here and your heart is lighter.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.  DERRY CITY: Gartside, Lafferty, McJannett, Toal, Boyce , Harkin , Hery , Fitzgerald , McGonigle , Akintunde, Ogedi-Uzokwe.

The  Johnnies will explain and demysty each topic and the world it occupies, providing real insights for viewers at home by deconstructing the skills required to make it in this unfamiliar territory themselves. In taking on TikTok, the lads meet with some of the top TikTokkers in Ireland like Lauren Whelan whose TikToks have been viewed over  million times. They also learn some valuable TikTok tips from Dublin comedian Killian Sundermann. Killian’s bizarre interactions with hedges have amassed millions of views. Meanwhile, Matty the Viking from Wicklow has made a living from training and chopping wood in a nearby forest, prompting Johnny B to try his hand at chopping wood with the usual hilarious results. They also meet experts in social media and try to discover the magic formula to ensure your TikTok goes viral. Armed with this knowledge, the lads set out to become TikTok famous, with the aim of getting a million views whilst raising funds for their local GAA club. To do this they need to be able to dance - which they can’t - so who better to call upon than professional dancer Karen Byrne of Dancing With The Stars fame to help them out for their big TikTok takeover...      In another episode, the  Johnnies take on urban art. This episode stems from the  Johnnies meeting with Peter Tunney, who runs the Wynwood Walls project in Miami, who appeared on their showThe  Johnnies Take on America last year. Inspired by his art, the lads wonderthey could help create a special mural in their native Tipperary, and so ensues a whirlwind tour of Ireland where they take inspiration from urban art festival Waterford Walls who specialise in large scale street art, take a lesson from childhood legend Don Conroy, meet some final year art students and put on their very first art exhibition! In another episode, the pair attempt to find a sport to represent Ireland in. And in true  Johnniesstyle, they won’t be taking the most well-trodden route. First up it’s a cricket lesson from Irish International legend Kevin O’Brien. The lads then head off-piste to Kilternan, where they get to grips with the ski slopes. Over the course of this episode, they also try their hand at clay pigeon shooting and find themselves in uncharted waters at the National Aquatic Centre but will they take the plunge off a -metre ing board  Finally, the lads are taken on by a Cork American football team and manage to make the trials for the Irish Wolfhounds. In the final episode in the series, the  Johnnies take on E-Gaming. Gaming and e-sports are growing at a tremendous rate with gaming now an entertainment phenomenon grossing more than the biggest movies and consuming more leisure time from the average household than Netflix. In this episode, the lads want to find out more about this ever-evolving subculture of competitive gaming and e-sports. They meet top gamers, streamers and Twitchers, as well as the Munster Rugby e-sports team, play FIFA with the FAI and compete in an e-sports tournament, rounding up some hurling legends to help them on their way. The lads then try to further assimilate into the gaming world, designing and attempting to sell their own game, “Grand Theft Chicken Roll”.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre has fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, councillors hope the complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.News of the shock decision to abort the Dunleath Park scheme was confirmed at a meeting in the town on Monday night when it was revealed that for legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the Charities Board when the lease was first drawn up.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A popular Ballynahinch newsagent has this week been forced out of business by burglars who ransacked his store.On Monday the shutters were pulled down on Ricersquos newsagents at High Street and are unlikely to be opened again by the current owner, Mr Eamonn Rice, who said the attack, the third in three years, has left him ldquomentally and physically wrecked.Thieves smashed their way into the store some time between Sunday night and the early hours of Monday morning and after stealing a large amount of property they completely destroyed anything in sight with crow bars and sledge hammers.Police believe the attack was carried out by professionals who are more than likely from outside the area, probably Belfast, and would have needed ready transport to escape with the goods.Yesterday Mr Rice as adamant that he did not want to have anything more to do with the shop saying that he could not go on working there after the heartless attack.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh pensioner, who has been stripped of his -minute-a-day home help, has accused health officials of abandoning him.Seventy eight year-old John Heaney, who can only walk with the aid of walking sticks, says he is ldquogutted his home help service has been axed and claims the decision came out of the blue.Mr Heaney, from Grove Park, said the first he knew about the decision to remove his daily home help cam when the woman who has been attending him for the past number of years informed him two weeks ago she would not be back.He said he now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free travel for the elderly scheme during a meeting with Strangford MP Iris Robinson.Down councillor Peter Craig and Strangford MLA Kieran McCarthy have been at the forefront of the free travel for pensioners campaign.Describing the ferry crossing as a ldquovital service, Mr Campbell said he ldquofirmly believed free fares should be offered to senior citizens, in keeping with the Department for Regional Developmentrsquos policy to target concessions at users of public transport.The travel scheme will only be available to passengers over  years-old who are travelling by foot and will not be put into effect until January.The Ministerrsquos announcement comes at the same time as confirmation that the pound.m ferry, the MV Portaferry II, will be delivered towards the end of

their battle to preserve the beauty of the foreshore which they fear is being irreparably damaged.Residents say diggers are being used to excavate large quantities of sand and shingle close to Fishermanrsquos Row and have already raised the issue with the Killough Community Association.Councillor Eamonn McConvey says he is concerned at what is happening and has asked Down Council to determinelegislation exists which prohibits sand and shingle being taken from the beach.NEWCASTLE mdash A telecommunications company which sparked controversy in Newcastle in recent weeks has taken steps towards healing damaged relations with local people.BT Cellnet representatives last week dismantled a mast at the Castlewellan Road in the town in an effort to appease the action group, Residents Against Masts , which was established to fight against the structure.The pressure group was formed last Monday night, just hours before the mast was erected against the wishes of local

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI. Thank you so much to the Air Ambulance team mdash you are amazing.With the recent easing of restrictions, Joanne was recently able to visit the Air Ambulance NI airbase and meet with representatives of the medical team.Joanne is encouraging the entire Equestrian Community to support her campaign. You can do so by Supporting the Horse Powered Take Off competition via https:dragoncompetitions product horse-powered-take-off .Including Ambulance NI in your horse show, such as by making a small donation from ticket sales.Organising your own lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo event, such as a cake sale, tea party, sponsored give away, or hack and snack.Working alongside Dragon competitions, Joannersquos competition will run throughout September and October and she has secured some fabulous prizes, including an equine bundle worth pound, from Fane Valley, pound, in cash and a horse solarium worth pound from R Nesbit Paddock Equipment. The winners will be drawn on October  by Dragon Competitions.Grace Williams, Area Fundraising Manager for Air Ambulance NI, said: ldquoWe are so inspired that Joanne has made a great recovery. Patients are at the centre of everything we do, and it is always lovely when patient families choose to get in touch.ldquoWe are humbled she decided to support the of wonderful work of Air Ambulance NI through her equestrian competition and campaign.ldquoAs a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep the medical team in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland.

For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

Picture Matt Mackey   Press Eye.Mr Swann said it was “regrettable” that the Executive has yet to agree a policy position on so-called vaccine passports.On Monday, Stormont ministers agreed a plan to drop the one-metre social distancing requirement across a range of venues, but decided that mitigation measures requiring proof of vaccine for entry to indoor seated venues would be advisory only.At the meeting, SDLP minister Nichola Mallon proposed Covid vaccine passports for those venues should be compulsory and introduced by way of legal regulation.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...While the proposal was backed by Alliance minister Naomi Long, it was voted down by the other Executive ministers, including Mr Swann.Those ministers instead voted to issue guidance to the venues, which include theatres and indoor concert venues, recommending the use of proof of vaccine as one entry requirement.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood branded the decision as “astounding and reckless”.The health minister said he did not back the proposal to make passports mandatory for indoor seated venues because such a scheme was “neither agreed nor ready”.He said the Executive would have been “ridiculed”it had told businesses fearful about the end of the furlough scheme that ministers had decided to mandate a vaccine passport system that was not ready to use.The issue is set to come to a head again next week when ministers consider whether to remove the one-metre social distancing requirement for hospitality venues.The DUP has consistently voiced concern about any move to introduce vaccine passports, citing potential human rights and equality issues.It has also emerged that Mr Swann wrote to all ministers on Saturday expressing frustration that the Executive Office’s Covid- task force had still not produced a policy paper on the issue, five months after he asked for the work to be done.In the letter, seen by the PA news agency, Mr Swann wrote: “I would ask as a matter of urgency that the TEO paper on domestic use certication be brought to the Executive without further delay.”In a statement yesterday, he added: “I want a domestic vaccine certication scheme to be in place, on the books, available for use as soon as necessary.“It is regrettable that the Executive has yet to agree a policy position on this. I wrote to Executive ministers as far back as April  asking for this matter to be taken forward by TEOthrough the creation of a cross-departmental working group.“We have waited for the Covid Task Force to pick up the ball and run with this. It is central to the task force’s entire purpose – charting a pathway out of restrictions.”Mr Swann said a passport system could be voluntary in the first instance with the option to make it mandatorythat was necessary.“If we can get a domestic scheme agreed – with the necessary regulations and technology in place – it gives us both options and opportunities, new tools to userequired,” he said.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularFormer IRA ‘folk hero’ is ‘hardly fitting face for Amnesty International campaign’ say unionistsCovid NI:  NI postcodes with the highest number of positive Covid test results in the last seven daysThe unionist parties come together to reject the Northern Ireland Protocol, and call for its replacement with arrangements that respect NI’s place in UKEx UDR soldier: I would never have missed the fine th anniversary tribute parade in Lisburn to an almost forgotten armyWhat is bunny hugging  - Boris Johnson reference mocked by leading climate activist Greta ThunbergMost PopularUNCUT: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s full letter about  Agreement to top US Democrat Nancy PelosiDublin UVF bomb victim condemns SDLP and Alliance Party over TUV appointments billThe DUP support for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea in  was a catastrophic error — one of the worst unionist mis-judgements of recent historyMan detained over  murder of RUC officerNorthern Ireland High Street Voucher Scheme: Almost , apply for £ spending card                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
