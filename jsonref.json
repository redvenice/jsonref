The findings will now constrain the liberties of everyone in Britain for much of the next 18 months. (Stock image)DO NOTHING?The Imperial College calculations show that if coronavirus were allowed to run its horrifying course in Britain unchecked, the results would be apocalyptic.Deaths would peak in the third week of June, with more than 20 people out of every 100,000 in Britain succumbing to the virus — almost 13,300 every day.Ultimately, more than 80 per cent of us might be infected.Critical-care beds would be filled completely by mid-April, with an eventual peak in demand 30 times bigger than the health service\u0027s maximum capacity.America, the report adds, would see 2.2 million deaths.The authors point out that this would only be part of the toll: many more would die of other illnesses because hospitals would be overwhelmed.Thankfully, however, nobody is recommending this approach.NOT ENOUGH?         The paper suggests that stopping mass events is predicted to have relatively little impact. (Stock image)The Prime Minister\u0027s original strategy against coronavirus was relatively limited, including asking people who had contracted the virus to self-isolate at home.Just four days later, he was asking us to put our lives on hold, possibly for months or longer.That first \u0027mitigation\u0027 strategy was based on the hope that the virus might progress at a predictable speed.Since the vast majority of people recover from coronavirus with no lasting harm, thereby acquiring immunity (at least for a time), the theory was that so-called herd immunity would kick in and the epidemic would die out.However, the computer simulation from the Imperial College team showed that mitigation would let the epidemic run like wildfire, causing an emergency surge in demand that would be at least eight times larger than the health service\u0027s ability to cope.Even if all those emergency patients could be treated, the report grimly predicts that about a quarter of a million Britons would die under this approach.SUPPRESSION KEYWith doing nothing and mitigating both predicted to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, the report stresses that \u0027epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy\u0027.This aims to reduce cases to low levels, making sure that the average person infects less than one person.To achieve this, the entire population of Britain must be instructed to distance themselves from others as far as possible, at work and at leisure.That is why everyone is now being told to avoid socialising, travelling or going out.Anyone who shows symptoms of coronavirus infection must be isolated at home, and their whole household quarantined.Without a vaccine, it seems there is currently no alternative.         The findings show that each person passes the virus on to an average of 2.5 others, and the number of infected people doubles every five days. (Stock image)VIRUS REBOUNDThese rules may be relaxed after five months or so, predict the authors, if the measures cause infection levels to drop.However, the restrictions will need to be re-imposed, perhaps repeatedly, when the virus inevitably returns.This yo-yo process could continue for around 18 months until — it is hoped — an effective vaccine might be produced.WHERE YOU GET ITThe report estimates about a third of transmissions happen in the household, a third in schools and workplaces, and the rest in the wider community.The experts believe that people who catch coronavirus typically incubate the illness for five days before displaying symptoms.They become contagious on average about 12 hours before their symptoms first appear.Each person passes the virus on to an average of 2.5 others, and the number of infected people doubles every five days.About half of those infected show no symptoms, or ones so mild they\u0027re not identified as coronavirus cases. Those who do exhibit symptoms are twice as contagious as those who don\u0027t.Happily, those who recover are currently thought to be immune to re-infection by coronavirus, at least in the short term.DEATH RISKJust under 1 per cent of people who contract coronavirus are expected to die. Around 4.5 per cent of those infected will need to be hospitalised. A third of those people hospitalised will need critical care. Half of those critical-care patients won\u0027t survive.AGE PERILIt is more helpful (though more sobering) to look at how different ages respond to the disease.The older you are, the more likely you are to have serious complications from the virus.The death rate for people:In their 20s is 0.03 per centIn their 30s is 0.08 per centIn their 40s is 0.15 per centIn their 50s is 0.60 per centIn their 60s is 2.2 per centIn their 70s is 5.1 per cent80-plus is 9.3 per centCLOSE SCHOOLS?Experts acknowledge that the most effective way to cut transmission would be to close schools and universities in addition to the other proposed strategies.However, they acknowledge this would present a serious difficulty. Vast numbers of health service staff have children at school, so they would have to take time off work to care for them.That could push the NHS beyond breaking point.GIGS AND SPORTMass events have been put on hold or cancelled. But the report suggests this might not be necessary. \u0027Stopping mass gatherings is predicted to have relatively little impact,\u0027 it says.This is because people spend less time in contact with others at such events compared with at work or in bars or restaurants.WE DON\u0027T KNOW...For all the expertise and computer modelling involved, the authors admit that their report remains only a best guess.\u0027Given that this coronavirus is a newly emergent virus, much remains to be understood about its transmission,\u0027 they say.Predicting epidemics will always involve many unknowns: for example, the virus could eventually mutate and become more or less infectious.Moreover, people can behave in unpredictable ways.Chillingly, the report says: \u0027It is not at all certain that suppression will succeed long term. No public health intervention with such disruptive effects on society has been previously attempted for such a long duration of time.\u0027For now, however, it seems we must seek to do everything we can to suppress this virus, thanks to the report\u0027s essential findings.        "},{"url":null,"title":"BBC air Taking Control Dominic Cummings Story kind look chief adviser","story":"Share this article          More than 20 supporters and critics will share their thoughts on Dominic Cummings, pictured with his wife Mary Wakefield in September last year.

The British Library is this month putting on a digital display of some of its more hidden treasures, including historic globes which will be available to explore online.The library has about 150 historic globes in its vast collection of books, manuscripts and maps. Most are so delicate they are rarely seen by visitors.On 26 March the library will launch the first fruits of an ambitious two-year project to digitise the globes, allowing people to see them in incredible close-up detail.“Everyone loves an old globe, don’t they,” said Tom Harper, the lead curator of antiquarian maps at the library. “When you see one you want to spin it.“They seem really visible, accessible things … but actually original globes are really quite elusive and even mysterious. Because they were built as tactile objects original ones are really rare and often in a terrible state.“The globes we’ve got here we have to be very protective of them. We can’t bring them out for readers to look at because they are so fragile so they are the hidden world maps and hidden star charts of the collection.”Seven globes will go online initially, including what is possibly the earliest miniature pocket globe, made by Joseph Moxon in 1679, which would have been seen as a gentlemanly status symbol.Other globes will include Richard Cushee’s 1730 terrestrial globe which has California as an island and the northwest of north America labelled “unknown parts”.Harper said globes were able to tell fascinating stories about the history of discoveries. “Globes are brilliant for that. You get a sense in the 18th century, before and after Cook, of this incredible excitement about exploration, what latest things were being found all over the world.“You can appreciate it more when you are looking at a globe, you get a physical sense of it being completely on the other side of the world which you don’t get when you look at a map.”There will also be original celestial globes going on the website, including one from 1606 made by the Dutchman Willem Janszoon Blaeu.These globes, which show the stars, would often have been paired with terrestrial globes, to be seen together as a 3D model of the universe.“It was quite a profound, conceptual thing to do when you think about it,” said Harper.“People haven’t really given enough time to them in the past, they are quite complicated things to understand.“It is with the celestial globes that you really get so much more of the culture of the age, of the people who were looking at and making the globes.”Library staff have worked with the digitising company Cyreal on the project for two years. Some of the globes have been photographed as many as 1,200 times to capture every aspect of their surface area. “The technology now is so much more accessible than it was five years ago.”The globes will be available on the British Library website. There will also be an augmented reality version of the globes, available via the Sketchfab app.Harper said there was still much to learn from historic globes and he hopes the public will help.“We want to find out things about these globes that we haven’t noticed before. It’s not just features or places on the globe which we haven’t noticed, they have been well studied, it’s more how these features are shown, and what that tells us about the people who were looking at them. It is more the contextual history we are interested in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4070ded3b88b4e42b3e3840cf5fd59c8611b266/140_0_4164_2497/master/4164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbdfe707fa254cca35e9104314c2c401","title":"chimamanda ngozi adichie rejects delusional plagiarism claim","story":"Author’s agents say renewed accusations by Anne Giwa-Amu, that her 1996 debut novel was plagiarised, constitute ‘harassment’Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s literary agency has fiercely dimissed “delusional” claims that her award-winning novel Half of a Yellow Sun was plagiarised.Nigerian-Welsh author Anne Giwa-Amu alleged in a YouTube video uploaded on Saturday that Half of a Yellow Sun plagiarises her own debut novel, Sade, which was published in 1996. In the video, Giwa-Amu describes Adichie’s book as “a rewrite of Sade” and says that “no one should profit from stealing another person’s work”. She uploaded a lengthy document to her website, laying out what she called “similarities” between the two novels.Sade is set during the Biafran war and follows the mixed-race daughter of a Nigerian supreme court judge, who falls for a barrister who is engaged. Adichie’s Orange prize-winning novel, published in 2006, follows lives torn apart by the Biafran war, focusing on an educated young woman, her houseboy and her lover, a professor.A statement from Wylie, Adichie’s literary agents, denied Giwa-Amu’s allegations and said that the author and her publishers “had never heard of Giwa-Amu’s novel until she brought her delusional claim” in 2016, when she first alleged plagiarism.According to the literary agency, a “professional independent reader” studied both novels and “concluded that there was absolutely no basis for Giwa-Amu’s claim”. But Giwa-Amu continued with it, and in February 2019 her claim was struck out by the court, which found it to be “an abuse of the court’s process”. Giwa-Amu was ordered to pay Adichie and her publishers £14,250, as well as the legal costs incurred by Adichie.“Her present allegations are false, libellous and constitute a harassment to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Further legal actions are being taken,” said the Wylie Agency, adding: “Till date, Giwa-Amu has not paid the money.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a2b94d4bbd207bc6c02dc8ad4c01bdb6a544ad/0_913_2660_1595/master/2660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c84960de3a6050e36c6aaaf8f8733e05","title":"hunker down cheer up and read books to distract","story":"From Nora Ephron to Thomas Mann, here are 12 books to entertain, challenge and inspire if you’re confined at home due to Covid-19 If you are the type of person who is tormented by the thought of all the books out there still waiting to be read, you are likely, for the worst of reasons, to have some time on your hands. Nobody would choose these circumstances in which to tackle their to-be-read pile, but books have a distinct role to play in times of trouble. The best of them absorb our attention, enlarge our sympathies and understanding and provide not merely simple distraction but a more complex way of engaging with the world and our place in it. These books – inidually brilliant and absorbing – also try, in very different ways, to examine how we function as human beings.This is the novel of recent years that I have most frequently pressed on people it is magnificent. Set in the late 15th century in a tiny Somerset village during Lent, it’s a cunning mystery – who is responsible for the death of the village’s benefactor? – and a profound exploration of faith, guilt and social cohesion. What elevates it is the quality of Harvey’s attention to the minuscule kinks and reflexes of human behaviour.Admittedly this book should come with a trigger warning for those whose greatest fear is getting stuck in a medical institution for years on end, but if you can stick it out in the Alpine sanatorium to which the protagonist, Hans Castorp, takes himself, the rewards are great. It’s hard to believe that Mann originally thought of his epic examination of Europe in the run-up to the first world war as a compact work – but he clearly needed all those pages – more than 700 – to weave his spell-binding, quasi-surreal story of civilisation and its discontents.Sixteenth-century devotional literature might not seem the rest cure you need, but to Donne, who wrote this series of meditations, expostulations and prayers in the aftermath of serious illness, it came naturally. Even now, its minute attention to what happens to the body, mind and soul when it is besieged by sickness and temporarily separated from wider society is deeply nourishing and, in an odd way, curative.Novelist Ben Okri describes this book, published in 1952, as a paradigm shift in literature experimental in nature, searing in subject matter, it stands as a novel that shifted the goalposts. In it, a nameless black man tells the story of his life from his current home, an underground room – through his upbringing, his abortive college career, factory work and his eventful relationship with a black civil rights group. It is, quite simply, unforgettable.Yes, in one sense it is “about” human cloning, but it is more importantly about the painful truth of our mortality and how we deal with the fact that, one day, we will be separated from everybody we love. No point in sugar-coating it: Ishiguro’s tale of a group of boarding-school students being used as part of a scientific experiment is immensely troubling and upsetting. But, this being Ishiguro, it also gets to the heart of the bonds between us, what we cannot bear to say, and what will survive of us.This essay collection – substantial but perfect to dip into – showcases the breadth of Smith’s curiosity and the facility with which she can shift between the sombre and the humorous, the small-scale and the vast. Subjects include Smith’s north London upbringing, Ella Fitzgerald, Justin Bieber and US politics as witnessed through the eyes of a British expat.Gallant was Canadian by birth, but a citizen of the world by nature – she lived in Paris for most of her life and retained an abiding interest in rootlessness and movement that inflect all of her work. This collection focuses on her early and previously uncollected pieces, and includes the extraordinary long story “The Burgundy Weekend” and “Going Ashore”, the peerless tale of a rackety woman on a cruise with her young daughter.Many have longed for escape from irritating family members, but very few have opted for full-on witchcraft – unlike Lolly, who alights on the village of Great Mop, moves there, and discovers herself making a pact with the devil, not to mention a cat called Vinegar. A delightful piece of earlyish 20th-century writing, with a nice line in appreciating the lengths women have to go to in order to avoid the domestic and familial responsibilities placed on their shoulders.Would that Ballard were here to see so many of his eerie predictions becoming flesh. In his absence, though, we have his work, including this turn-of-the-millennium warning about a gated hi-tech community peopled by sleek executives and an extremely disturbing psychiatrist, cast in the role of Prospero. Violent, subversive and gripping, it will make you relieved to be at home.Into each life some rain must fall, but journalist Christina Patterson had, by the time she reached middle age, endured a monsoon – serious illness, bereavement and the loss of a job that played a large part in her sense of identity and well-being. Undefeated, she set about collecting the stories of others who had stuggled to create a powerful portrait of the continuation of life and the pursuit of contentment.I read this novel on a ship in the middle of the ocean, so I’ve thoroughly sea-tested its ability to draw you in when there’s not much else to do. Set in rural West Yorkshire, it follows the lives of a group of villagers scandalised by the vandalism visited on the local postbox through its stolen letters (including one, written to the local authorities, that boasts 100 footnotes). Disgruntled dog walkers, manic amateur dramatists and a policeman in pursuit of the culprit all feature surreal humour and linguistic antics abound.There’s barely a day when I don’t think of Ephron as I contemplate the loss of elasticity and youthful vigour in the mirror. But it’s not all sic transit gloria mundi in this wonderful celebration of life: there’s also the story of the author’s time as an intern in JFK’s White House, in which she is sure she’s the only female employee whom the president didn’t make a pass at (“Perhaps it was my wardrobe, which mostly consisted of multicoloured Dynel dresses that looked like distilled Velveeta cheese”), her search for the perfect handbag and, pertinent for our purposes, her lifelong love of reading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e36e70f31b1bfb02aa3addd76c4d1f0e52c86b/0_56_1190_714/master/1190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2208f891a55f6d63da187814fc1cf9e4","title":"brewdog begins making hand sanitiser shortages uk","story":"Brewer says product will be given away for free to those in need during coronavirus crisisThe independent brewer BrewDog has begun making hand sanitiser at its distillery in Aberdeenshire amid shortages driven by coronavirus fears.The firm said it would be giving away the “punk sanitiser” for free to those that need it.BrewDog’s founder, James Watt, announced on social media that the company had started producing sanitiser to help with shortages. “We are determined to do everything we can to try and help as many people as possible stay safe,” he said.The company said it was “working around the clock on producing the first batch to have it available for next week”, and the sanitiser will be given away to local charities and the community rather than sold. It comes amid shortages of hand sanitiser, which has been flagged as an important tool in combating the coronavirus.HMRC said it was prioritising applications from manufacturers to enable them to produce denatured alcohol, a type of spirit that is not for human consumption and exempt from excise duty. A range of chemicals is added to the alcohol to render it undrinkable.Many supermarkets and chemists have placed strict limits on the number of hand sanitising gels shoppers can buy as producers struggle to source enough ingredients and small plastic bottles.With heavy demand, independent gin producers have also been switching their production. Verdant Spirits, based in Dundee, is reportedly aiming to produce 400 litres of the gel starting this week, while Bristol’s Psychopomp Microdistillery and 58 Gin in London are also working on similar products.In France, the luxury goods group LVMH has switched to producing hand sanitiser at three of its perfume and cosmetics factories for distribution to French hospitals fighting coronavirus.Twelve tonnes will be produced as soon as this week, instead of the usual Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy scents and make-up usually made at the three French sites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe7d13332d9ae25c67a1c82afea35016aee70682/0_228_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592f61957b39330bcd651df4c8b52697","title":"sellafield nuclear waste plant close coronavirus staff","story":"The controlled shutdown of the Magnox plant in Cumbria will begin in the next few days after an outbreak of the Covid-19 virus within Sellafield’s 11,500 staff.The company told employees on Tuesday evening that it would “scale back some operations” to “make best use of available people”.Sellafield revealed last weekend that a staff member had tested positive for coronavirus, and on Monday it confirmed that another employee with suspected Covid-19 had begun self-isolation.The number of Sellafield employees self-isolating has quickly climbed to about 1,000.A Sellafield spokesman said the number in self-isolation included people with symptoms of the virus as well as those with underlying health conditions who undertaking social distancing.In an open letter to staff, Sellafield’s safety director, Mark Neate, said: “We have a critical mission so our response must ensure the safety and security of the public, our workforce and protection of the environment at all times.”The company has plans for remote working for some staff to help limit the spread of the virus but Neate said many employees would need to keep coming in to work.“Given the nature of our work many of you will need to continue to attend your workplace – either because your work directly impacts nuclear safety or security, or because you provide a business continuity or support function and are unable to work remotely,” he said.The Magnox plant is to close permanently this year.

Some 10,000 claims were filed Monday and nearly 12,000 more came on Tuesday, bringing the number to 30,000 since Friday.“I’ve never seen anything like this,’ deputy commissioner Daryle Dudzinski, who has been at the Labor Department since 1992, told the Courant. “It’s unbelievable.”The sell off is picking up on Wall Street.

But the “high” scenario shows it jumping by 24.7m worldwide, from 188m last year.By comparison, the 2008-9 global financial crisis increased global unemployment by 22 million.That ‘low’ scenario is based on governments protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and employment, and supporting jobs and incomes.

Add the £290m of store-related business rates that the company won’t be paying this year (at least according to the natural reading of Rishi Sunak’s emergency plan) and, hey presto, Morrisons could be looking at a year of bumper profits, runs one line of thinking.Unlike pubs, clubs, restaurants and theatres – Sunak’s main intended beneficiaries – the doors of supermarkets are wide open and punters are rushing in, to the extent that restrictions are being placed on what they can buy.Yet the idea that investors are poised to enjoy a pandemic bonanza is very silly. Supermarkets were not included in the business rates holiday so that shareholders could pocket the difference. The Treasury, one assumes, was trying to incentivise behaviour that the chains, to their credit, are adopting anyway.David Potts, Morrisons’ chief executive, gave a few examples: paying small suppliers immediately extending sick pay to staff who would not normally be eligible adding cleaners hiring more staff to cover absences extending online deliveries. Such “feed the nation” policies cost money.If there’s anything left from the business rates freebie, it’s unlikely to find its way to shareholders. A bonus for staff would be a far better use of surplus funds. The Treasury might even want a few quid back if things turn out better than expected.The new governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, says his “strong preference” is to keep stock markets open. Quite right: closure would look panicky and deprive some ordinary savers of access to their investments, even if the value of those investments has plunged.What’s more, the stock market’s fumbling daily assessment of points of stress can be useful to policymakers. The signals are mostly showing red for danger, but the shades of red also matter.Bailey, however, sounded weak when he called for short-sellers – those betting on share prices to fall – to behave themselves. “Anybody who says, ‘I can make a lot of money by shorting’, which frankly might not be in the interests of the economy, the interest of the people, just stop what you’re doing,” said the governor. An appeal for everybody to play nicely is probably not going to cut it.A ban on short selling would be controversial, and is generally only adopted by policymakers when there are specific dangers, such as runs on banks. But, if the Bank judges that short-selling is making a bad situation harder to manage, just implement a ban. “Please stop” is not a message that is likely to be universally obeyed.Over in the government bond market, the European Central Bank ought to be worried. The gap in yields on eurozone countries’ bonds is widening. In short, there’s a rush for the safety of German bunds, with the debt of the likes of Italy, Greece and even France being shunned, relatively speaking.The situation is a long way from being a rerun of the eurozone debt crisis of 2011. Nor did the position worsen notably on Wednesday versus Tuesday. One would also expect market gyrations – investors can see a tidal wave of new government IOUs coming down the track as countries rip up borrowing pledges.This subplot could quickly become significant.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba1cd5d19609416bc4aa0036718a172d1ecb51f0/0_291_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe3776082f4690f53f61bd38f3ce0c74","title":"coronavirus exposed britain insurance industry businesses cover","story":"Businesses are being caught out, lacking the cover they thought they had. The whole sector needs a rethink• See all our coronavirus coverageThe concept of insurance is marvellous. Iniduals or corporations pay to spread risk across a large community, creating a greater degree of financial security and peace of mind, regardless of what challenges might end up materialising.In many cases it’s worked flawlessly for centuries. Businesses burned to the ground can often emerge from the ashes in a matter of months. Disability and sickness mustn’t spell certain bankruptcy. In the 18th century, the wives and children of deceased members of the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office were guaranteed cash, thanks to what’s believed to be one of the earliest examples of life insurance as we know it.The insured should be able to rely on an uncompromising safety net in the toughest of times, and yet - as we’re enduring precisely such a time - coronavirus is adding debilitating insult to unprecedented injury by exposing the shortcomings of the insurance sector: the system we’re using is not fit for the modern world, and the cost of these deficiencies could well be cataclysmic.In theory everything looked quite all right. The vast majority of companies across the UK and beyond tend to have business interruption insurance that pays when they can’t operate. A similar type of insurance, known as contingent business interruption insurance, comes into play when a critical supplier to an insured organisation can’t function. If you’re a company that makes smartphones in the US, but the Chinese factory supplying your microchips suddenly floods, you’re likely to be protected. A French luxury goods company whose Indian fabric manufacturer has been wiped out by a storm? Same thing.The problem is that in the vast majority of cases, these policies cite “direct physical loss or damage” as a requirement to be triggered. Quarantines and travel bans might make it impossible for a business to keep its doors open, but they don’t constitute obvious physical damage. So as far as the insurer’s concerned, it’s not their problem.It wasn’t always like this. In years gone by some insurers were more forgiving when it came to the prospect of paying out when disease struck, mostly because at that point major global disease was little more than a theoretical prospect. Then Sars and Ebola provided a lesson in what was actually economically viable - how far insurers can be stretched - and suddenly it became pretty clear that the parameters would have to shift.The world has become much more interconnected. Supply chains are deeply complex and travel far easier. Bugs can be spread from one side of the planet to the other in a matter of hours while infecting hundreds en route. Taking on the risk of having to foot the bill of an uncontrollable pandemic has simply become unpalatable for anyone, particularly if no one can actually say for certain what the true extent of the impact might look like. It would be like asking an insurer to sign a blank cheque.In the best case scenario, businesses are aware of this and have made alternate provisions, even if these might be painfully pricey. In the worst case though, they’re blind to the risk altogether. For smaller companies unable to hire a team of experts, understanding the nuances and caveats of what might look like a pro forma policy is an unenviable task. Ten years ago no one was stress-testing for coronavirus.So we need education. Businesses can’t afford to be caught out as is happening now. They need to be able to scan the horizon and know what could be lingering up ahead: what provisions are in place and what risk truly means.Perhaps even more urgently, though, politicians need to understand the domino effects of an inadequate insurance sector. On Monday, Boris Johnson advised the public against going to pubs, restaurants and bars. As of Tuesday night, he hadn’t issued an official order for such venues to close – and this matters. Many business owners, particularly in the hospitality industry, have expressed outrage, sparked by fears they won’t contractually be able to make insurance claims unless the government explicitly bans their venues from staying open. Some commentators accused Johnson of favouring the insurance industry, after it was revealed he was paid £25,000 to speak at an event held by the British Insurance Brokers Association (Biba) in May. (Biba has since defended the decision.)In a furious letter to the prime minister on Monday, Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (and a former Tory MEP), warned of an existential crisis as a direct result of the guidance issued by the government. “Thousands of pubs and hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost in the very short term unless a proactive package creating cash and liquidity is provided immediately to the industry,” McClarkin wrote.The Association of British Insurers was quick to point out that, even if the government were to force closures, the “vast majority of firms won’t have purchased cover that will enable them to claim on their insurance to compensate for their business being closed by the coronavirus”. But it nonetheless admitted that some, typically larger, firms “might have purchased an extension to their cover for closure due to any infectious disease”. Surely if the government can relatively easily provide a swift lifeline to even a tiny number of large businesses – businesses that provide jobs and jobs that support families - then that’s a step worth taking.It’s human nature not to entertain the grimmest of ideas. We don’t like to think about the worst case scenario because it’s uncomfortable. But perhaps the lesson we’re learning here is that we have to confront the inconvenient to protect ourselves.On Tuesday the government said it would guarantee £330bn of loans to businesses struggling in the face of coronavirus. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also announced tax breaks in an effort to avert a full-blown recession. That’s to be applauded, but the shortcoming of the insurance sector is just one example of why we need a structural and sweeping rethink of the way in which the government supports business. A one-off sticking plaster just won’t do the trick.• Josie Cox is a journalist and broadcaster specialising in business, finance and gender equality"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d802ae154d3ad8a70e65e19c73a5ead238e90c5/0_178_2775_1666/master/2775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fabd3b4def63bc3cc66354a6a4b50e7","title":"coronavirus uk expert advice wrong","story":"The warnings from China and Italy were loud and clear. But politicians and their advisers wasted valuable time – and lives will be lost as a result• Richard Horton is editor of the Lancet medical journalOn 24 January, Chinese doctors and scientists reported the first description of a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus. They described how a strange series of cases of pneumonia had presented in December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the capital of Hubei province. At that time, 800 cases of the new disease had been confirmed. The virus had already been exported to Thailand, Japan and South Korea.Most of the 41 people described in this first report, published in the Lancet, presented with non-specific symptoms of fever and cough. More than half had difficulties in breathing. But most worryingly of all, a third of these patients had such a severe illness that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Most developed a critical complication of their viral pneumonia – acute respiratory distress syndrome. Half died. The Chinese scientists pulled no punches. “The number of deaths is rising quickly,” they wrote. The provision of personal protective equipment for health workers was strongly recommended. Testing for the virus should be done immediately a diagnosis was suspected. They concluded that the mortality rate was high. And they urged careful surveillance of this new virus in view of its “pandemic potential”.That was in January. Why did it take the UK government eight weeks to recognise the seriousness of what we now call Covid-19?In 2003, Chinese officials were heavily criticised for keeping the dangers of a new viral disease, severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome (Sars), secret. By 2020, a new generation of Chinese scientists had learned their lesson. Under immense pressure, as the epidemic exploded around them, they took time to write up their findings in a foreign language and seek publication in a medical journal thousands of miles away. Their rapid and rigorous work was an urgent warning to the world. We owe those scientists enormous thanks.But medical and scientific advisers to the UK government ignored their warnings. For unknown reasons they waited. And watched.The scientists advising ministers seemed to believe that this new virus could be treated much like influenza. Graham Medley, one of the government’s expert scientific advisers, was disarmingly explicit. In an interview on Newsnight last week, he explained the UK’s approach: to allow a controlled epidemic of large numbers of people, which would generate “herd immunity”. Our scientists recommended “a situation where the majority of the population are immune to the infection. And the only way of developing that, in the absence of a vaccine, is for the majority of the population to become infected.”After weeks of inaction, the government announced a sudden U-turn on Monday, declaring that new modelling by scientists at Imperial College had convinced them to change their initial plans. Many journalists, led by the BBC, reported that “the science had changed” and so the government had responded accordingly. But this interpretation of events is wrong. The science has been the same since January. What changed is that government advisers at last understood what had really taken place in China.The UK’s best scientists have known since that first report from China that Covid-19 was a lethal illness. Yet they did too little, too late.The virus quickly made its way to Europe. Italy was the first European country to suffer huge human losses. On 12 March, two Italian researchers, Andrea Remuzzi and Giuseppe Remuzzi, set out the lessons of their tragic experience. Italy’s health service simply could not cope. They did not have the capacity of intensive care beds to deal with the scale of infection and its consequences. They predicted that by mid-April their health system would be overwhelmed. The mortality of patients with severe infection was high. A fifth of health workers were becoming infected, and some were dying.They described the situation in Italy as an unmanageable catastrophe. They wrote: “These considerations might also apply to other European countries that could have similar numbers of patients infected and similar needs regarding intensive care admissions.” And yet the UK continued with its strategy of encouraging the epidemic and the goal of herd immunity.Something has gone badly wrong in the way the UK has handled Covid-19. I know Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance. I have the utmost respect for both. They have had the services of some of the most talented researchers in the world to draw on. But somehow there was a collective failure among politicians and perhaps even government experts to recognise the signals that Chinese and Italian scientists were sending. We had the opportunity and the time to learn from the experience of other countries. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the UK missed those signals. We missed those opportunities.In due time, there must be a reckoning. I sat with the director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Geneva in February. He was in despair. Tedros had been criticised for not calling a public health emergency of international concern sooner. But when he did and when he asked for the modest sum of $675m to help the WHO combat the growing global pandemic his pleas were ignored.The UK is now taking the right actions to defeat this new epidemic. But we have lost valuable time. There will be deaths that were preventable. The system failed. I don’t know why. But, when we have suppressed this epidemic, when life returns to some semblance of normality, difficult questions will have to be asked and answered. Because we can’t afford to fail again. We may not have a second chance.• Richard Horton is a doctor and edits the Lancet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854eabf8be9787971efe64ea4228b89815272e8/0_194_5232_3139/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15d75ab3ed7fe102a2567f481221c180","title":"pupils schools open government coronavirus","story":"The government urges us to avoid gatherings to contain Covid-19, yet does nothing about classrooms. The situation is fast becoming untenable•See all our coronavirus coverageSchools are to remain open in England. So says a government that, seemingly, worked out later than Twitter that herd immunity would cost a quarter of a million people their lives. It is the same government that is unable to clearly explain the logic behind not testing doctors and nurses on the frontline of fighting this virus. Teachers, therefore, can be forgiven for thinking that our leaders are, again, wrongly interpreting the facts.The rationale for keeping schools open (though Scotland and Wales are closing theirs from Friday) has been that children do not seem to get seriously ill with Covid-19 and that closing schools would cause huge social disruption. Health and social care would suffer as workers remain at home looking after children grandparents might be tasked with childcare when already at greater risk from the virus. Yet it still remains unclear what role children play in the spread of the virus.On Monday morning at the secondary school where I teach in central London, and across the country, thousands of pupils, parents and teachers had approached the day with the weariness of those expecting the very worst but unable to take a different course of action. My school being open meant that I, despite my underlying health condition – asthma – needed to swallow the fear of contagion and turn up to do my job. School was abuzz with talk from pupils and staff about why we were there at all, and when the government might see the light and follow the rest of Europe by closing its schools.Younger pupils, whose parents are concerned about them being home all day, were most likely to be in class. Those in higher year groups were, in some cases, nearly a third down. But as the day wore on and more pupils showed symptoms and were sent home, the mood began to turn. By the last lesson, when a student quipped with gallows humour that he was “dying to learn”, I was having to ask myself what, exactly, were we all doing there?After school that day, we learned from the prime minister that the country was moving from the delay to containment phase, where mass gatherings were banned and people would be asked not go out “even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others”. The government’s insistence that schools remain open, even after such an announcement, only supports the notion that it is unable to grasp how schools actually function.Over the weekend, in a group chat with teaching colleagues, I had joked that the closure of our prime minister’s alma mater, Eton College, meant it was one rule for the rich and another for the herd. Many colleagues have expressed a similar sentiment, believing that the government sees teachers and state-school pupils and their parents as expendable.The National Education Union has asked for, though not received, modelling comparing different scenarios for school closures. As teachers, our anxiety and uncertainty is only deepened by the vague language of guidance and advice that the government insists on dishing out and the seeming inconsistency of its approach. Thus, in this moment of national crisis, Boris Johnson can advise that we protect ourselves and those who are vulnerable, yet make our doing so feel like the desertion of colleagues who we know are struggling to find their way through this emergency.Already a number of schools have announced that they will be closing their doors. Simply put, there aren’t enough teachers and ultimately, closing schools might be a decision taken out of the government’s hands. A fifth of teaching staff are, like myself now, already self-isolating. Classes are being collapsed and supply teachers are proving difficult to come by. While school staff can only be commended for working their way through the chaos and confusion, we are fast approaching the point at which the situation becomes untenable.If closures happen without coordination, proper provision cannot be made for our most vulnerable children. How will children and families in volatile homes be supported through the stresses of illness and self-isolation? How, in the event of schools closing, does the government intend to support children whose only proper meal of the day is the one they have at school?There are so many questions – and that’s before we ask whether GCSE and A-level exams are to go ahead in spite of such widespread disruption. So many questions and, as is proving a theme, so few answers.• Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and  columnist focusing on race, politics, education and feminism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c65e1eca05c49397ecc7c49dcc6b6378dc73577/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=216b2fd3e51fdd87e99e78f7c6d88b93","title":"when i am working at home no distraction is too small","story":"I am avoiding my shared office for fear of potentially infecting my colleague, but how am I meant to get anything done when there is an old bag of lentils to finish off?I have long being doing, or trying to do, most of my work at home. This involves writing, watching and listening to stuff and an awful lot of reading. Somehow, heroically, I manage to do a little of all of these things despite the cacophony of distractions.Consider the fridge and the kitchen cupboards. There is just so much in there to be thought about, resisted, thought about again, nibbled at, put away, nibbled at again, put away again, taken out once more and finally polished off.During this enervating ritual, I might chance upon a foodstuff I have not noticed for a while and see that it is approaching its best-before date. I will try to get back to my laptop, but the, say, old pack of silken tofu will niggle away at me it will become a scratch I have to itch. Before I know it, I am leafing through cookbooks, my massive file of cut-out recipes and the entire world wide web. I will find something that excites me. Usually, it will have a dozen or so ingredients, all of which I will have – bar one. But now I really have to, absolutely must, cook this thing. I will pop to the shops after I have done a bit more work.I go back to the laptop and see something I need to print out. Unfortunately, the printer inexplicably won’t print, which feels like an total affront. All work, even meal planning, must stop for the printer to be fixed. Nothing else matters. I can’t possibly do any more work until this calamity is resolved. I turn the printer and my laptop off, then back on again. I do this several times, until the printer eventually starts working. By this time, I have clean forgotten what needed to be printed in the first place. But I do see that an ink cartridge needs to be replaced. What with that and the missing ingredient, a trip to the shops can’t wait a moment longer. Off I go.It has been like this, or a version of this, every day for as long as I can remember. So, when a friend of mine, a proper writer, suggested we rent a tiny office space, in desperation, I agreed. Here we sit, typing away, facing each other across a small desk. It works, for me, anyway, like a dream. He has this incredible ability just to sit and work for whole minutes and even hours at a time. This means I have no choice but to do exactly the same. There is no food in this bare cell, just two jars of herbal tea (chai and rooibos) that I have been trying to get through for years. I get lots of tea drunk and plenty of stuff written.I am put in mind, not for the first time, of something Alexei Sayle said years ago: “The secret of being funny is having funny friends.” I have been nicking my funny friends’ funny lines all my career. Now I find that the secret of focusing on writing is to have a friend to sit with who is good at focusing on writing.The trouble is, this friend of mine has a lung condition and I am frightened of breathing potentially offending droplets in the poor bloke’s direction. So, I am writing this back at home. Since I sat down three hours ago, I have made my daughter her tea and, in doing so, chanced upon an old bag of red lentils. With that, I have made a Moroccan-flavoured dal I found a recipe for on a vegan website. While cleaning up, I noticed the dishwasher was making a dreadful noise. I spent 15 minutes finding the handbook, which advised that the problem might be a foreign body in the drain pump or non-return valve. No, me neither. A vein pulsing on my temple, I set about the matter at hand. This was a bad idea. As any member of my family will confirm, there is no technical problem I can’t make worse by attempting to solve it. But I pressed on it was, after all, something other than what I was supposed to be doing, and that is the main thing.Eventually, I found a small nail in the impeller. I am 53 on Saturday, and in all my days I have neither successfully repaired anything nor come across the word impeller. To my consternation, I managed, with the impeller newly nail-free, to reassemble the appliance without breaking anything. And, joy of joys, the noise is no more. Such a welcome shaft of light in these dire times. I am now seriously thinking of descaling a shower head. I will let you know how that goes.The dal was great, by the way. Who knew Moroccans were so into lentils? I do now, because I have just frittered away another 15 minutes Googling it. But I am bang out of red lentils. Better get off to the shops to pick some up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d29f5e2aa8ebb32afb2cf06a43b731e816b4135/0_0_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5420123a17f7b9620232c53281aa4ff6","title":"cambridge students urge university to cancel final exams over coronavirus","story":"Hundreds of Cambridge students have signed a letter asking to retake their final year or postpone their examsCambridge University is facing calls to allow students due to graduate this summer to restart their final year in September due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Hundreds of undergraduate students have signed a letter to Graham Virgo, the pro-vice chancellor for education, calling on the university to overhaul its summer exams amid widespread fears that the outbreak will adversely affect their exam performance.The demands came as the university’s vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope, announced it was asking all students to leave, with all teaching moving online and no exams being held in Cambridge. The university plans to shut on Friday.He wrote: “We are all facing an unprecedented crisis. It may be months before we resume normal activity.”The students’ letter raises concerns that they face significant hurdles to revising and taking exams remotely during the Covid-19 outbreak, such as self-isolating or being quarantined due to potential exposure to the virus, and restrictive firewalls in some international students’ home countries.The students called on the university to offer alternative modes of assessment, such as vivas conducted via video or coursework or postponing exams and dissertation deadlines until after the pandemic passes or restrictions such as social distancing and quarantining have been relaxed. Some degree courses are normally entirely graded on final-year exams.They also want final-year students to be given the option to restart that year in September, or to retake the Easter term in 2021. They also propose students could receive a degree classification based on previous grades, dissertations and other coursework, or even be awarded an unclassified degree.The letter warns that unless students’ needs are accommodated the situation could be detrimental both to their academic performance and their wellbeing. It adds that marginalised and less privileged students, including those with disabilities and those who have gone back to repressive regimes, would likely be worst affected.The letter warns that students have raised concerns in recent days about issues posed by studying at home, such as lacking desks, books, computers and a stable, high-speed internet connection.A final year social sciences student, who signed the open letter, said he was concerned that even taking exams remotely might become untenable if growing numbers of staff and students became ill or had to care for loved ones during the pandemic.The student added: “We are asking for students to be given a choice of options because they faces different challenges. All my family are self-isolating, and I do not have a stable high-speed internet connection in London. Many overseas students will likely face further difficulties.”The finalist said he would prefer to receive a grade based on his previous assessments or a portfolio of essays submitted next term. If he postponed his graduation this would prevent him from either pursuing a masters degree or a job offer in the autumn, both of which were dependent on him achieving specific grades, he added.A director of studies at Cambridge, who is also a teaching officer in one of its faculties, said the students were “rightly concerned” about the summer exams, as the situation posed serious challenges for the university. The academic, who asked to remain anonymous, added: “There is for most students also four weeks of teaching still to be done. Cambridge also has more to decide about in that relatively little teaching has ever been done online and there is relatively little continuous assessment.In an email to all staff and students today, the vice-chancellor announced that the university had moved into its most serious “red” phase in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with all students asked to return home.Toope added: “There will be no face-to-face teaching in the Easter term, and there will be no examinations in Cambridge. All teaching will move on-line. The university will communicate with all students by the end of March about alternative assessment arrangements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46d66d27e20429bf7421501763a679f13d004213/0_198_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a52f11e8ac7eeeb4512a8794ff9f7ee5","title":"scotland and wales to close schools by friday due to coronavirus","story":"Decision on English schools said to be imminent as Welsh schools are repurposedSchools in Wales and Scotland will close by the end of this week, as Boris Johnson hinted that a similar decision on closing schools in England was “imminent”.The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said schools were to close by Friday at the latest, and would then be repurposed to provide childcare and supervision for children affected by the coronavirus outbreak, including the children of key workers.“From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak,” Williams said.“The key areas we are looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. We are looking in detail at how we can support and safeguard all those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs.”The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said “lives are being disrupted like never before” before announcing schools and nurseries would be closing at the end of the week.Sturgeon said her government would be focusing on three things as schools closed: supporting vulnerable students, particularly those who rely on free school meals, addressing the issues with exams, and arrangements that provided some kind of support and care for key workers’ children. The Scottish government will set out the details on Thursday. “In some areas, private daycares and nurseries can play a massive role in helping key workers keep going,” Sturgeon told a press briefing in Edinburgh. “In other areas, councils will use school buildings to reach vulnerable children. We will support any and every plan that helps people make this work.” The first minister said people should not assume that schools and nurseries would reopen after the Easter break or summer holiday. “We will of course only keep them closed for as long as we absolutely have to. But at this stage, I cannot promise that they will reopen before the summer holidays.” Sturgeon described closing schools and nurseries as one of the hardest decisions the government had had to make so far during the pandemic.Schools policy is devolved to inidual national administrations, allowing them to make their own decisions over closures before those in Westminster.The moves in Scotland and Wales came as headteachers were increasingly being forced to turn away pupils, cancel events and secure essential supplies while preparing for closure.Hundreds of state schools in England have either closed or partially closed because of severe staff shortages sparked by the government’s new policies on long-term self-isolation, affecting pregnant women and those with conditions that make them vulnerable such as asthma.Independent schools, including some of the most famous names in English education, have also announced immediate closures. Winchester college announced that all pupils would return home from Wednesday afternoon because of staff shortages.“The requirement for more stringent self-isolation on both academic and support staff means that we are nearing the point where we will be unable to offer boys the necessary levels of care,” parents were told.Meanwhile, local authorities and schools were pre-empting the government by drawing up plans to keep skeleton staff in schools to look after the children of key workers such as those in the NHS or frontline services. Some schools are preparing to go further and offer supervision for children whose parents are still required to work, such as those in catering or delivery networks.Schools in local authorities including Hackney and Rotherham have been contacting parents to ask whether they are employed in key sectors.Answering questions in the Commons, Johnson told MPs that they “should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools”. He has previously promised to resolve issues including looking after the children of key workers and providing food for pupils currently eligible for free school meals.School leaders have expressed frustration with the lack of advice on staffing and staying open they have received so far from the Department for Education, with heads waiting on hold for more than an hour for their calls to the DfE’s coronavirus hotline to be answered.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Meanwhile, British universities also moved to empty their their campuses of all but essential staff and researchers. Oxford University’s famous Bodleian library shut its doors on Wednesday, while Imperial College and University College London told students that services and facilities would be unavailable, and that they should prepare to move out of accommodation.The University of Cambridge said its libraries would close from Wednesday evening and other buildings would shut on Friday, with staff to work from home unless needed for “business-critical” activities.“We are asking students – both undergraduate and postgraduate – to return home now, if possible. It is especially urgent for international students needing to make travel arrangements to do so as quickly as possible, as many countries are already imposing travel restrictions,” Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope, said.Toope said for students unable to leave Cambridge, “college accommodation will be available if needed”.Previously, universities had cancelled lectures and in-person teaching while otherwise remaining open, but are now taking more aggressive action."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a7dae2b08f5b98caa13343f12369d93ae43ead1/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec2da7a795ff4fb44e8c2fd6d1f7ab1e","title":"wonderchicken oldest fossil of modern bird discovered","story":"Tiny creature, half the size of a mallard, found in rocks dating back to dinosaur ageExperts have discovered a fossil of the world’s oldest known modern bird – a diminutive creature about half the size of a mallard duck.Dubbed the Wonderchicken, the remains were found in rocks dating to about 66.8m to 66.7m years ago, revealing that the bird was active shortly before the asteroid strike that wiped out the dinosaurs 66m years ago.“This is the oldest evidence of modern birds that we have so far,” said Dr Daniel Field, of the University of Cambridge, an avian palaeontologist and co-author of the research.Modern birds evolved from meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, with creatures such as the 150 million-year-old Archaeopteryx cropping up along the way. In sharp contrast to Archaeopteryx, modern birds have no teeth and tend to lack the bony tails and clawed wings of many of their predecessors.It is not clear exactly when modern birds emerged, but estimates range from about 110m years to 85-70m years ago.“As best as we can tell, this fossil sits very close to the common ancestor of two major groups of living birds – the group that eventually gave rise to chickens and their relatives, and the group that eventually gave rise to ducks and their relatives,” Field said.The team says the discovery pushes back the date of the earliest known modern bird: the record was previously held by Vegavis whose fossils were discovered in Antarctica and dated to about 66.5m years ago.Writing in the journal Nature, Field and colleagues describe making the discovery while carrying out CT scans on a specimen donated to Maastricht Natural History Museum. The fossils were unearthed 20 years ago by an amateur fossil hunter at a quarry in Belgium, near the border with the Netherlands, within sedimentary marine rock that is part of the so-called Maastricht Formation.At first, said Field, the specimen appeared unprepossessing. “It is basically four small blocks of rock with a handful of broken limb bones visible, poking out of the rock,” he said. However, on digitally “removing” the low-density rock around the fossil using computer software, the team found something special.“As soon as I did that, this incredible skull – one of the most incredible fossil bird skulls in the world – stared straight out at us, and we could not believe our eyes,” said Field, noting that the lack of teeth and other features of the skull quickly suggested it was from an early modern bird.The team say the bird would have weighed about 400g, about half the size or less of a mallard duck. “It is the same size as a green-winged teal, which is one of the smallest ducks in the entire world,” said Field. “We think it would have had a face that looked a little bit like a modern chicken, and the back of the skull looked a little bit more like a living duck,” he said. Its long slender legs – together with the rocks it was found in – suggest it may have lived along the shoreline.The bird’s official name is Asteriornis maastrichtensis, a reference to the place it was found and the Greek goddess of falling stars, Asteria.“We thought that that was apropos because the fossil is so close in time to the asteroid impact,” said Field, adding the Greek myth describes Asteria being transformed into a quail and throwing herself into the ocean to avoid Zeus, features that nod both to the animal and the habitat in which it may have lived.The team say the fossils not only suggest modern bird evolution was in its early stages when the asteroid struck, but its discovery in Europe opens up debate about whether modern birds emerged in the southern hemisphere, as has previously been proposed.Prof Julia Clarke, an expert in avian palaeontology and Vegavis from the University of Texas, in Austin, who was not involved in the study, described the find as “fantastic” and said it fitted in well with predictions based on Vegavis. “Finding this new fossil in Europe is key to understanding a global pattern of extinction and survivorship in the Latest Cretaceous,” she said. Prof Mike Benton, a palaeontologist from the University of Bristol, said the new skull was “gorgeous”, adding that previous contenders for the world’s oldest duck have been queried, and that fossils hunters have been searching hard for unambiguous members of the modern bird group that definitely lived before the dinosaur mass extinction.“The new fossil ticks all the boxes,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d28f5d63d4438231ea2ce02a1b2518d05c4d1e04/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8bda9518704c79eed0f5b916f4a0b6","title":"home wears comfort dressing from socially conscious brands in pictures","story":"Bamboo eye masks, beauty products from waste coffee grounds and socks to support homeless charities: here’s our pick of items to help you feel snug while supporting small businesses"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d903120b3484e2c5863f8740646cc85b782f651/0_162_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f67e73228a23925c556260b2804df747","title":"david atherton recipe butternut pasta bake squash","story":"Pureed squash makes a silky sauce – and means you can scoff this macaroni dish in the knowledge that you are not eating loads of cheeseButternut squash is not just a vegetable.

Sentences like, “Manchester United are working from home.” Or, “West Ham’s Karren Brady has suggested there is an antidote to the deadly coronavirus pandemic.”If the latter reference puzzles you, let’s see it in action in Karren’s critically misunderstood Sun column from last weekend (in which she decided, among other things, that the Premier League season should be declared null and void and Liverpool denied the title despite being 25 points clear at the top).“The only antidote at present,” explains Baroness Brady of coronavirus, “is care in human contact and unrelenting pursuit of hygiene.” I heard that antidote meant something different than that? But as I’ve had to remind myself so many times over the past couple of weeks: you’re not an epidemiologist, Marina. Listen to the experts in this case, the vice-chair of West Ham.In many ways it feels unfair to single out any particular master or mistress of the footballing universe for mild sarcasm. From Brady’s bunch of arse to de‑facto virus‑modelling from Uefa, who seem to be speculating that Istanbul could well be fine in June, Big Sport is struggling to pivot to its new position of immense irrelevance.Not that a form of lip service isn’t being paid. Arguably the most unintentionally comic pose is that of the sporting big cheese taking magisterial care to explain to you there are more important things than sport right now. Is that a fact? Like me, you probably had no idea there were, until a member of Her Majesty’s Sports Press enlightened you.But of course the self-importance goes much higher. In this vein, it is absolutely no surprise to receive a lengthy statement from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in which he informed the planet: “Cooperation, mutual respect and understanding must be the guiding principles for all decision-makers to have in mind at this crucial moment in time.” Something for the director-general of the World Health Organization to take on board, there. I’m sure it means so much more to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, coming from one Swiss‑headquartered chief executive to another.Even well-meaning gestures seem like acts of absurdist theatre. On Tuesday, Sky Sports made a public announcement that pubs will not be charged for their Sky Sports accounts during this period of no sport. And, indeed, this period of no pubs.Against this backdrop of wild malfunction and warp-speed recalibration, then, comes the Breaking! News! that Uefa will hold Euro 2020 in the year 2021, or at least it will on current estimates. The decision was reached in Uefa’s Tuesday conference call, a telephonic fixture trailed slightly more portentously than a second-tier Champions League tie. The announcement would have seemed unthinkable once upon a time (ie two weeks ago). But this week it was largely met with the sort of seismic shock you’d expect to greet the news that your club’s second-choice right-back was likely to be out this weekend with a thigh strain.The Premier League will be next out of the traps, of course, with their “crunch talks” scheduled for Thursday. I note from football dispatches that England will be “worst hit” by the mounting fixture backlog and there is a “genuine fear” the season may not be able to be played out. Which does feel like it should place maybe three or four on the list of “genuine fears” doing the rounds.In some ways the most fascinating reaction to the implication of the postponement is those who have retreated into the familiar comfort of simply assessing where the England team may be in terms of development one year after scheduled kick-off. If your way of dealing with existential stress is to say, look: it’s going to give Phil Foden a whole extra year to be brought on … then, you know, fine. Whatever gets you through it. But I would be failing in my duties as a human if I didn’t say: are you OK? Do you want me to get some shopping in for you?We’re in the relatively early stages of a deadly pandemic and the leader of the free world is Donald Actual Trump, while our prime minister is Boris Actual Johnson. I feel like wondering if Dean Henderson will be pushing Jordan Pickford for the England goalkeeper spot is at best a slight swerve of the main point and at worst not quite the swings‑and‑roundabouts positive it’s being billed as. Though your footballing fundamentals are doubtless sound, even working through them out loud feels considerably less rational than even the Twitter user I saw react to the Euro 2020 postponement with the deathless analysis “fuck the person who ate the fucking bat”.Then again, why cavil? There is a strong displacement activity feel to a lot of these high-level discussions and which of us can say we aren’t in need of a bit of that right now? If you, me, or anyone else can even momentarily distract themselves with the ins and outs of how Uefa may reach this or that decision that will almost certainly be overtaken by events infinitely bigger than it, then let’s have it. Social goods come in many forms and we’ll have plenty of time to be surprised by some of the more recherché ones in the months ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f633c96c8a49177da8bdb4ddaa297c1ae7052ebd/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=256dcdc382f7306c170705fdac948973","title":"euro 2020 euro 2021 winners and losers football","story":"Kane and Rashford can recover, Haaland can get even better but Belgium, Ronaldo and Modric could be on the way downFor several weeks it had been clear that, given the rate of Covid-19’s spread, a pan-European tournament was the least desirable event possible. Postponing it was the only sensible, conscionable and practicable thing to do: it sends the right message at a time when people across the continent will have to make temporary changes to their lives and also ensures football plays its own part in keeping potentially dangerous movements to a minimum. And when this is all over, perhaps Euro 2021 will take on a new, potent and poignant life as a celebration of bonds restored and friendships rekindled.Harry Kane and Marcus RashfordIt would not be a major tournament without a personnel scare in the England camp and, realistically, will probably still not be one either. But a year’s delay lifts the anxiety over getting Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford fit and firing for a tournament whose Wembley-based latter stages ensure there is plenty of pressure to be present at the sharp end. If nothing else, the long months ahead will allow time for plenty of daydreaming about a Kane trophy lift on 11 July next year.Erling Braut Haaland and Europe’s other young gunsWould Euro 2020 have come too soon for some of the continent’s best youngsters to upstage the existing order? We will never know but, assuming they can outgun Serbia in the play-offs, an exciting Norway generation – spearheaded by Erling Braut Haaland and Martin Ødegaard – will have extra time to smooth the rough edges. Other teams may benefit similarly even their fellow play-off participants Kosovo, whose star winger Arber Zeneli now has added scope to recover from a cruciate injury. Perhaps the year’s delay will ensure the orthodoxy is turned on its head.Dutch fortunes have picked up considerably over the past year and there is a school of thought that, given another 12 months and a few more fixtures to prepare, Ronald Koeman’s team may be able to compete seriously for the title. They already have the world’s best defender in Virgil van Dijk but Frenkie de Jong, Donny van de Beek and Donyell Malen will have had more time to refine themselves into a unit better than the one thatcurrently looks likely to fall just short against the very best.It comes some way down the list of current health concerns but there still seems little harm in giving Europe’s top-tier footballers a breather, especially if this is backed up by shortened domestic and ChampionsEuropa League campaigns. You will hardly find a top manager who, at least privately, likes the relentlessness of the modern schedule and perhaps a buildup with less football being played will help players’ fitness and give us a better spectacle too.Euro 2020 always looked like the last chance for the rump of Belgium’s hugely feted “golden generation” to bring home a trophy. Shifting things back a year is not the end of the world but it might make a difference to a squad whose best players are hovering precariously around their peak. Eden Hazard will be 30 by the time the rescheduled tournament kicks off Kevin De Bruyne will turn 30 during it. Toby Alderweireld and Axel Witsel will both have turned 32 while Jan Vertonghen will have attained confirmed veteran status at 34. Even Romelu Lukaku and Thorgan Hazard will be senior players at 28. Youthful promise will have given way to delivery-or-bust.Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka ModricWill a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo still be in prime shape to help Portugal retain their European crown? Far stranger things have happened given the supreme condition in which he keeps himself but it is hard not to think that, given his astonishing goalscoring record with Juventus this season, Euro 2020 would have arisen at exactly the right time. Modric, seven months younger than Ronaldo, has a similar issue. The way he dragged Croatia to the World Cup final was inspirational but will those legs be able to perform one last hurrah in 2021?The Football Association of Ireland’s financial woes are well-documented and have, over the past year, been the subject of an official inquiry. So the postponement of four games at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin is unlikely to be good news for the debt-stricken organisation, and nor is the wait over as to whether Mick McCarthy’s team earn them a windfall by qualifying through the play-offs. And therein lies another huge, thorny issue: McCarthy was to be replaced by Stephen Kenny on 1 August as part of a long-established succession plan. Early suggestions are that both men will assert their right to the throne if Ireland do make it – assuming the play-offs take place this summer at all – and the situation could become a messy one.It should not be taken as a dismissal of women’s football that the original Euro 2021 will almost certainly now need moving. Covid-2019 has wreaked havoc upon the entire calendar and everyone is going to have to absorb some significant inconvenience. The priority now must be to make sure the competition gets the platform and visibility it merits. Holding it back-to-back, or even concurrent, with the men’s tournament would be logistically difficult on many fronts – not least when this summer’s Olympics still seem in the balance. Far more sensible would be to maintain its own slot in 2022 no one wants to wait another two years given the immense quality of Euro 2017 and the 2019 World Cup but there is unlikely to be a better way.The veteran manager was due to bow out with a Euro 2020 campaign partly contested on his team’s home turf in Copenhagen. He will retire this summer and be replaced by Kasper Hjulmand, with no wrangling expected over that state of affairs. “My contract expires on 31 July and I expect we will terminate our cooperation after that date is planned,” Hareide said. It is an unfortunate way for a fine career to end but, it seems, a dignified one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166dcfd84a9c626239d5a20bf4973be581df4560/1452_169_2896_1737/master/2896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ebd1442f277a7b13bce2292db9f502a","title":"i havent worn colour since i was 14 meet britains longest standing goths","story":"Born in the 80s, goth is still going strong. Four devotees discuss the music and fashion and how love of the macabre draws together a warm and friendly sceneGoths are perhaps the most maligned of all subcultures. Over the decades, they have been unfairly blamed for high-school shootings, depression in teenagers and antisocial behaviour. In reality, goths are a collective of people bound by a shared love of fashion, music and art.Goth emerged out of the punk scene in the north of England in the 1980s. Its adherents are immediately recognisable by their black clothing and jewellery, their passion for artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Nick Cave and the Sisters of Mercy, and their fondness for imagery and lyrics referencing the macabre, darkness and death. And the eyeliner, of course.Years of unfavourable press attention have bound goths together more tightly than other subcultures. “The scene has been partly defined by how it’s been viewed negatively,” says Dr Paul Hodkinson, a sociologist at the University of Surrey and an expert in goth culture. “That negative attention can give its participants an extra commitment to the scene, and strengthens their identity in the face of a perceived mainstream society that misunderstands or mistreats them.’”Unlike other subcultures, says Hodkinson, goth culture tends to be close-knit as a result of this shared experience of victimisation. Many goths stay active in the scene throughout their lives. We spoke to some of Britain’s long-standing goths about the scene, fashion and music, and whether they ever see themselves wearing colour in their future.I have been a goth since university. There was a girl – she was interesting and cool and she dragged me to a goth club. Nothing ever happened with her, but the goth thing stuck.I was living in Wolverhampton at the time, and there wasn’t much goth stuff going on. I heard about the first Whitby Goth festival, in 1994, through forums on the internet. There were 212 of us there. It completely exploded my mind.My dress sense has varied a lot over the years. I’m not as young as I once was. I don’t have a full mohican any more – I got rid of it around 2000, when I started going thin on top. Since then, I’ve developed a love of hats. I’ve got a massive wardrobe. I wouldn’t call it a wardrobe – it’s probably about three rooms.I always make a big effort on Halloween. One year, I was a white wolf. I had lace-up white boots, a white gothic jacket and a wolf head. I crept up behind my friend and growled at her. She ended up having a panic attack. I guess that outfit was a little too successful.Being goth is not something I’m going to grow out of. I’ve got masses of friends from the alternative scene. There’s this misconception that all goths are miserable. Yes, there’s a sense of macabre, but there’s an amazing camaraderie and sense of community.I think because of my size, I get less abuse than other goths. I’m quite good at de-escalating hostile situations. I can normally sort things out without fighting. There’s always the odd drive-by shouting, but you get used to that. A few years ago, I was in Camden, north London, with a girlfriend — we were all dressed up to go to a ball. People in the street started whistling The Addams Family theme tune. But we were quite proud of it. At one of the earliest Whitbys, a few idiots came up from Scarborough and decided they would try and intimidate us by blaring 80s music from a Vauxhall Corsa. But the police moved them on pretty fast.Lots of goths tend to avoid customer-facing roles, because they get asked to tone down their outfits by their bosses. I’ve only been asked to do that once, when I was working for a traffic company years ago. I had grabbed a T-shirt out of a drawer without looking at it and it had quite an offensive slogan on it, so that was fair enough. It’s not such an issue for me, because I quite like wearing suits. I look good in them – as long as they are tailored.I have a theory that lots of goths were bullied growing up. Society turned its back on us, so we all went off and did our own thing. The clothes and the makeup are just a way to differentiate who is worth getting to know. Some people look at the clothes and are put off. But the people who take the time to look beneath it are the ones worth getting to know.I have been a goth since I was 13. It’s just my taste – I’m drawn to darkness. Growing up in Italy, I was really into music and art. I loved Caravaggio, because he was so dark. I discovered the band Paradise Lost when I was 18 – they were the first band I heard that blended metal with goth. For me, that was the perfect mix. I read an interview with them where they talked about being from Yorkshire, and I thought: where is Yorkshire? When I moved to York, it was bizarre, knowing I was in the place where goth metal was basically invented.I dress goth every day. I haven’t worn colour since I was 14. Normally, I wear pale foundation, black eyeliner and blue, black or dark red lipstick. I can’t see myself ever wearing colour. I briefly worked as a theatre steward in Cambridge when I was younger. The uniform was yellow – it wasn’t like it was burning my skin or anything, but now that I don’t have to wear a uniform, I only ever wear black. I think if I ever went into work wearing coloured clothes, my colleagues would have a heart attack! We joke that I should wear a floral dress on Halloween.My house is entirely black and white. I have too many skulls to count. I’m really proud of the downstairs toilet – I call it my little catacomb. It’s painted black, even the ceiling, and I have a customised loo-roll holder in the shape of a coffin. I’m currently waiting for a customised four-poster bed with a built-in spiderweb to arrive.I’m more into goth music than the aesthetic. I don’t like how the goth scene is split in two. There are the people who are there because they love the music, and then the people who just like to go to Whitby and dress up. Why would you pretend to be goth just for a day? It makes a mockery of goth culture.People assume that you’re depressed if you’re a goth, but it’s just the way I am. I think it’s a positive thing to think about death. You think about the end to remind yourself to make the most of life each day.I have been a goth, on and off, for 20 years. I got into it as a teenager – I would listen to bands such as Sisters of Mercy, the Mission and New Model Army. It helped that I grew up in West Yorkshire, which is where lots of goth culture was based. Growing up in a small town, people weren’t used to alternative subcultures they were quite vocal about it. You had to be careful about how you would present yourself in public, to avoid getting into trouble.I can still remember my first proper goth night out. It was a club called the Phono, this old-school alternative goth club in Leeds. I’d go there all the time. It was so exciting. It was this world of dreadlocks, big hair, PVC and Dr Martens.For a long time, the goth scene was in decline, but things are probably as good now as they have ever been. I run a festival called Goth City and in addition to that there are maybe a dozen goth festivals in the UK, and 100 gigging goth bands.If I’ve got meetings at work, I wear a suit. Otherwise, I wear black jeans, a black blazer, pointed boots and a black frock coat. I always find myself returning to that hammy Victorian style – I like the tailcoat and white shirt and big hair aesthetic. David Vanian of the Damned is probably my biggest style influence. And if I’m going out, I like to make my long black hair as big as possible with hairspray.I would like to be able to express myself as I want more often. Work isn’t such an issue – you can rock a strong goth look and still be extremely smart. I think goths tend to look more professional than non-goths. But it’s harder to find the time and spaces to dress goth as you get older. It becomes less practical, as you are in goth spaces less often. That said, I definitely don’t ever go out in tracksuits or blue jeans. I do own a single pair of jeans. I wear them maybe once a year, in summer.There can be a bit of street heckling that goes on. It’s never particularly intelligent: people will shout “Dracula”, or whatever horror movie they can think of. It’s only ever if I find myself in a town centre on a Friday or Saturday night, when people have been drinking. That’s when you want to be careful. But I would never go out in that environment anyway, because you’re looking for conflict. I tend to avoid town centres on a weekend. I don’t want to attract attention. It’s not really an issue for me – I wouldn’t want to go out there anyway. Nothing brings me into town.I see myself as an old-school goth. Not in an elitist way, but more in the sense of being true to the original counter-culture tradition of goth, as it came out of Leeds. We have an agenda that is liberal and progressive and an affinity to a darker, romantic view of the world. We’re not all unhappy. There are a lot of extremely chipper goths out there. The idea that all goths are morbid and depressed definitely isn’t the case.I got into goth music when I was 13. When you’re a teenager, you feel like you need your own identity. Post-punk alternative goth music appealed to me, so I went from there. My father absolutely hated it. He couldn’t understand why I was dressed all in black. The more he disliked it, the more I rebelled.Between 13 and 16, I couldn’t go to pubs or nightclubs and meet other goths, so I stayed in my bedroom and listened to goth music and read Melody Maker and NME. When I left my bedroom, I would wear black leggings, pointy boots, a Sisters of Mercy T-shirt and have my hair all black and crimped. I did get a lot of stick for how I looked – I was the only goth in my sleepy market town.As soon as I turned 18, I moved to Leeds because that was the epicentre of goth culture. It was great: amazing nightlife, really nice people. But the scene died overnight in 93, 94. I’d go down to the Phono nightclub and it had completely changed. All the people I knew there had stopped going. They all moved on with their lives. But I thought: “I’m not ready to grow out of this.” So it developed into more of a lifestyle than a phase. There isn’t another Mel who isn’t a goth.My house is all goth: black flock wallpaper, black settees, black gloss furniture, baroque-style ornaments. I never get bored of wearing black. It’s a godsend, because you never have to separate your clothes when you’re wearing them. I married a goth. We had the wedding in a castle, and I wore a purple corset, with a big flouncy skirt to go with it, and purple and black hair extensions.Any time something bad happens, like a shooting spree, people say: “He was dressed in a trench coat and listening to Marilyn Manson.” But that doesn’t define goth. It goes a lot deeper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b63b9954893e848fb889ffb0624837db104fe072/0_1155_3073_1844/master/3073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=993c7743308372b512995dfb8f209f87","title":"the back door fell out and we cant shower in our new rental","story":"My partner and I signed a £900 rental agreement on a house three months ago. It was described by the letting agents, Connells, as a having a bath and a separate shower. On the first day we found out that the shower dispenses scalding water only – and is therefore dangerous and unusable – and we immediately reported it to Connells. We had several visits from a plumber before it was concluded that the whole unit needed to be replaced. Moreover, the back door fell out of its rotten frame and it took two days before it was boarded up, which invalidated our insurance. It was never replaced. We have also reported the conservatory roof leaking badly and causing mould on the walls. This complaint was not even acknowledged. We know from the landlord that the faulty shower was reported by previous tenants – so he was aware of the problem, but chose not to do anything about it. We would not have rented the property knowing it had no working shower. I know that, for goods and services, we would have protection under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 for items “not as described”. Does it apply to tenanted properties? MS, CannockUnfortunately it does not. Or rather, not in the way you are hoping. The act does outlaw unfair terms in tenancy agreements which are not prominently and clearly stated.In your situation the rights are stacked in favour of the landlord who, ultimately, can withhold your deposit or even evict you. When I asked Connells whether it checks properties before renting them, it said they are assessed thoroughly and claimed that the rotten door was marked in “good condition” there was no sign of a leak and the shower fault was not known about as a different agent had previously managed the property.It said the landlord preferred to use his own contractors, but has now agreed to allow Connells to organise the work. However, although Connells told me the landlord was prepared to discuss compensation, he has since refused your request for a rent rebate, stating that a shower is not reflected in the rental cost, which covers “space, location and facilities such as a new kitchen and two toilets”. Many properties lack a shower, he adds irrelevantly in his response to you.Tenants in your predicament have limited options. If you withhold rent the landlord is entitled to serve a notice to quit. You run the same risk if you sort repairs yourself then deduct the cost from your rental payments, although you can do this for minor repairs provided the landlord has had ample opportunity to carry out the works and you have notified them in writing that you plan to organise the work yourself if they don’t step up within a given deadline.You must obtain three quotes and send receipts and forewarn them in writing at each stage. You can’t even decide to walk out or the landlord may sue you for any rent you owe right up until the contract ends, although you can give notice if there is a serious breach of the agreement.If neglected repair work is causing a health and safety risk you can ask the local council to inspect the property. You could also complain to the property ombudsman, of which Connells is a member.As a last resort the small claims court is an option for repairs costing less than £1,000.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

He has jammed with the likes of Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, BB King and even Bill Clinton. Loyal to music but not to genre, he plays jazz, blues, rock’n’roll, country, boogie-woogie, swing, big band and beyond. No matter the musical style, Davis will play it, because he believes that music in all its variations is a great equalizer. So when he entered the Silver Dollar Lounge in Frederick, Maryland, for a country gig one fateful night in 1983, being the only black man present did not perturb him at all.While this was not his first country gig at the Silver Dollar Lounge, it was his most significant. After he and his band finished their set, Davis was approached by a patron who was around 15 years his senior. Not an unusual occurrence for a working musician. However, while praising Davis on his performance, the patron candidly noted that he had never seen a black man who could play like Jerry Lee Lewis.More curious than offended, Davis used this encounter as an opportunity for friendly discourse rather than outrage. “I explained to this older white guy that Jerry Lee Lewis was influenced by the same black boogie-woogie and blues piano players as I was,” Davis says with a chuckle. “He didn’t believe me. Then I told him that Jerry Lewis is a good friend of mine and well, he didn’t believe that either, but he was fascinated.”“So he asks me to join him for a drink,” he continues. “I don’t drink so I had a glass of cranberry juice and then he took his glass and cheered me. Then he said, ‘You know, this is the first time I ever sat down and had a drink with a black person.’ I was instantly curious and thought, ‘What’s going on here?’ So I asked him why. He didn’t answer at first but eventually admitted that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.”This is a story Davis shares on lecture stages and in classrooms – both nationally and globally. It is an important anecdote as it marks a catalytic moment in which Davis’s trajectory pivoted from working musician to race relations crusader.What began as a hobby gradually transformed into a calling. As his music career continued to flourish, Davis also became enmeshed in quite arguably the world’s strangest side hustle – meeting with KKK members of various ranks and attending so-called cross lighting rallies. Some of these Klansmen became close friends of Davis’s – the aforementioned Silver Dollar patron included – their long conversations untangling a knot of hate that had coiled for decades. In many cases, these civil dialogues led them to quitting the organization because they no longer believed in its tenets.While some say Davis converted these men, he prefers to say that they converted themselves, and that he merely provided the impetus for them to do so. Over the past 30 years, Davis has become well-versed in the organization’s ethos and hierarchy which led to him to becoming the first black man to write a book about the KKK entitled Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man’s Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan, which was published in 1998.The Ku Klux Klan was formed in 1865 by a group of Confederate soldiers at the end of the American civil war in an attempt to keep newly emancipated slaves suppressed. Having seen several iterations, what remains consistent across all chapters of the group is its hate toward people of color, sometimes resulting in assault and murder. In 2018, 153 years later, a record high of more than 1,000 hate groups – including the KKK – were documented as active in the United States by the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights group. “Our ideology needs to catch up to our technology,” Davis said recently as a guest on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.So why would a successful musician like Davis willingly meet with high-ranking KKK members in his spare time? The journey to that answer begins long before his Silver Dollar Klan encounter in 1983.“In 1968, when I was the age of 10, I had a racist incident,” Davis recalls with conviction, his voice sonorous and unwavering. “I was in the Cub Scouts and we were in a parade when people started throwing rocks and things at me. I didn’t understand why people would do that and I formed a question: ‘How can you hate me when you don’t even know me?’”“The answer was always, ‘there’s some people who are just like that,’” Davis adds. “Well, that wasn’t good enough for me. What does ‘just like that’ mean? Where does that come from? You’re not born ‘just like that. I was curious about racism ever since, but even still, nobody can seem to answer the question.”One of Davis’s first and most fabled encounters was with Grand Dragon Robert Kelly, who eventually became the Imperial Wizard of Maryland. After having his secretary set up a meeting with Kelly under the pretense of including him in a book about the KKK, Davis knew he was entering new territory. Kelly was unaware that Davis was black, so the grand reveal was a shock. After a few tense hours of conversation, the two parted ways, but their relationship did not end there.Eventually, Kelly began inviting Davis to his home and then to Klan rallies in which ritualistic chants were intoned, giant crosses were burned, and beer and hot dogs were served. Kelly shared everything with him, including the deeply racial stereotypes that help form the foundation of the Klan’s hatred. All the while, Davis listened, asked questions, took notes, and through his actions, slowly dispelled each stereotype one by one. With each conversation, the gap between them narrowed and they were able to become friends.Finally, Kelly quit the Klan, shut down his entire chapter and, as a trophy of sorts, gave his robe to Davis. That was not the last Ku Klux Klan robe that Davis would be gifted nor was it the last Klansman he would befriend.“I still perform sometimes and though I would much rather be on stage playing happy music all the time and seeing people dance than be talking about the KKK and neo-Nazis,” Davis says with a laugh, “I have found that lecturing and talking and educating people is far more important and necessary today.”Davis has lived through several eras of hate – from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 to the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Though he has convinced hundreds of white supremacists to deradicalize and join the land of the loving, he does not deny that some are beyond saving. However, that acknowledgment does not deter his mission as he continues to focus on those who are open to conversation, open to civil discourse, open to friendship, and ultimately, open to change.Most recently, Davis partnered with Minds, an open source social networking platform that uses blockchain to reward the community with ERC20 tokens. Davis hopes to utilize this platform, founded by Bill Ottman and John Ottman, to educate people on how to conduct civil discourse. Beyond the world of white supremacy, the idea is to help iniduals navigate through opposing perspectives – be it at a political protest, in a classroom, on social media, or at the dinner table.“People must stop focusing on the symptoms of hate, that’s like putting a Band-Aid on cancer,” Davis says. “We’ve got to treat it down to the bone, which is ignorance. The cure for ignorance is education. You fix the ignorance, there’s nothing to fear. If there’s nothing to fear, there’s nothing to hate. If there’s nothing to hate, there’s nothing or no one to destroy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e48af1ec972a6c998d4a92019fc7793cf1a03e9/0_9_8660_5196/master/8660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a800ce48a61c19aa5f6e93f126d73924","title":"a cure for insomnia","story":"Like a growing number of people, Simon Parkin suffered from insomnia for years.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

The coronavirus can be spread through airborne droplets released when infected people cough or sneeze, so keeping your distance reduces your chances of becoming infected by this route. Avoid contact with anyone with symptoms of coronavirus: a high temperature andor a new continuous cough.No, but for most people it means radical lifestyle changes. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family, avoid venues such as pubs, clubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres, and work from home wherever possible. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. You can go out for a walk for exercise, but stay two metres away from others.Avoid it whenever you can. Handrails, buttons, windows, seat fabrics and other surfaces can all become contaminated. If you have to travel on buses, trains or trams, try to avoid rush-hour and other busy times of day, and wash your hands.Some people are at much greater risk from coronavirus than others and it is doubly important for them to follow the advice. This includes everyone aged 70 or above, regardless of how healthy they are, and people of any age with specific underlying conditions. The list of medical conditions includes long-term respiratory problems, such as asthma, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) heart disease, such as heart failure chronic kidney or liver disease neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s and MS, problems with the spleen, including sickle cell disease, and anyone with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIVAids, or on steroids or chemotherapy. People who are obese, with a BMI of 40 or more, and those who are pregnant are also in the high-risk group.A further group of people at even greater risk from coronavirus and NHS England intends to contact them with specific advice in late March. That group includes people who have had organ replacements and are on immuno-suppressants those with cancer who are on chemo- or radio-therapy, people with bone marrow or blood cancers, such as leukaemia those with severe asthma, cystic fibrosis and other serious chest problems, and people with other serious medical conditions, for example those needing kidney dialysis.The government is expected to issue even stricter advice in the coming weeks, with those aged 70 and over, and other vulnerable groups, being asked to self-isolate at home for 12 weeks. This aims to keep their contact with others to a minimum when the epidemic in the UK reaches its peak.First of all, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, drinking enough water, and exercising regularly. Try to avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Open the windows for some ventilation and try to get some natural sunlight. It’s an opportunity to read, listen to the radio, watch TV and pursuing other indoor hobbies.The most common symptoms are a new continuous cough andor a high temperature. If you live alone and have either, no matter how mild, stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days.The infection is likely to spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period.If you can, move them in with friends or family for as long as you are in isolation. But if you can’t it is important to be meticulous about cleaning and handwashing and stay away from them as much as possible. Minimise the amount of time they spend in shared areas, such as kitchens, bathrooms, and sitting areas, and keep those areas well ventilated. The infection can spread through shared towels, crockery, cutlery and other items, so if possible make sure they have their own. If you share a toilet or bathroom, clean all the surfaces after using the facilities.There is no specific advice on breastfeeding. Babies can pick up the infection, though the evidence so far suggests that children are generally not as badly affected as adults. The government states that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks of the virus, but add that it is a personal decision people can discuss with their midwife or health visitor.Keep yourself hydrated and consider painkillers such as paracetamol to help with symptoms. If your condition worsens, or your symptoms don’t improve in seven days, use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111. In an emergency, call 999."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc3dab8dcf134aacf8a0377c8dc0b132daab13f/0_12_4023_2415/master/4023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=911ceda879b35920d408da5aa259a3d1","title":"my favourite game uruguay v ghana world cup 2010 quarter final","story":"I was in the stadium to see Luis Suárez break Ghanaian hearts with his handball. It was cheating, but also an understandable act of self-sacrificeAlmost a decade on, the 2010 World Cup is recalled as a tournament of low-scoring matches, played out amid the distracting honk of vuvuzelas. As is usually the case, the host country showed its best and most welcoming side, rendering happy memories to visitors only to leave a disappointing legacy for South Africa itself.Every tournament, though, will throw up at least one segue of incredible drama, of unlikely and since-forgotten heroes, skulduggery and adrenaline-surging plot twists. The rest of the quarter-final between Ghana and Uruguay was decent enough. The climax to the 120 minutes made the night unforgettable.Fine goals were scored by Sulley Muntari and Diego Forlán, but it was not a classic, in keeping with much of the fare on show during those 31 days. Luis Suárez’s handball, and the subsequent penalty drama, meant it ended up as a tale of the bad guys running off into the sunset, chortling at their ill-gotten gains.Soccer City, a monstrous carbuncle looming over Soweto, was the venue. The South African support in the stadium lay with the Ghanaians, in a spirit of pan-African partisanship. Almost as inescapable as the vuvuzelas that month was the Shakira earworm “Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)”, which blared from speakers everywhere. The sentiment of that song was followed by fans of the disappointing Bafana Bafana, willing on their friends from west Africa to become the first team from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final.Ghana and Africa were to be denied by Suárez’s cynicism. Dirtier deeds done since mean his deliberate handball from Dominic Adiyiah’s goalbound header in the dying seconds of extra time is almost the least of his on-field sins. In fact, it was perhaps his most forgivable transgression against football’s code of conduct an act of self-sacrifice.Footballers of any level would consider it, if the price of breaking sportsmanship’s codes was defeat. Alongside him, his teammate Jorge Fucile had made a far more obvious, ing attempt to punch the ball away to safety, but it was the then-Ajax striker whose hand got in the way.Still, if Ghana scored their spot-kick here they would be through. Asamoah Gyan, then of Rennes, was brave enough to step up. The prize was a Cape Town semi-final against the Netherlands, who had earlier that afternoon defeated Brazil to widespread cheers in the press room. The world’s foremost footballing country brings the most journalists and Brazil’s exit meant that those self-interested hacks still in South Africa had a good chance of being at the final a week later.Gyan missed his penalty, crashing it against the crossbar. He had clearly been distracted by the lengthy delay as Uruguay – ludicrously – protested the innocence of Suárez. And from the vantage point of the press box high in the stand Suárez’s solemn march down the tunnel became a sprint of double-fisted joy as he ran to the dressing room.And yet, when the dust had cleared, and a penalty shootout followed, it was Gyan who chose to take Ghana’s first penalty after Forlán had stroked home the opener. Whereas Stuart Pearce waited six years to find redemption for England in scoring a spot-kick against Spain at Euro 96, Gyan was not given much more than five minutes to collect himself.This time, he slotted past Fernando Muslera to set up a sequence that ended with Adiyiah, denied a second time, missing his penalty. Uruguay’s Sebastián Abreu rubbed Ghana’s noses in it, scoring the decider with a Panenka.Gyan’s redemption had lasted barely five minutes as he broke into understandable tears. Uruguay’s celebrations did not show much in the way of regret. “Calling it cheating is too hard, it could have been a mistake,” said their manager, Óscar Tabárez. It was an answer that defied credibility, almost as deeply as what had taken place during the match itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997b206e1abcb97938985aee5142ef004397e925/0_464_3322_1994/master/3322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=174023be6cb506204fa33db23a238930","title":"talking horses racing industry left to contemplate cost of suspension","story":"Ireland is now the only major racing jurisdiction in Europe where the sport is continuing during the coronavirus pandemicRacing in Ireland will continue behind closed doors from this weekend but with a series of added measures to guarantee social distancing and minimise the impact on key resources, leaving Ireland as the only major racing jurisdiction in Europe where the sport is continuing during the coronavirus pandemic.From Friday, when the scheduled all-weather Flat meeting at Dundalk will switch from the evening to the afternoon, there will be no more than one meeting each day and no evening meetings. Owners will not be allowed to attend, no runners from overseas will be allowed to enter and there will be a maximum of 30 minutes between races to assist with social distancing.All weighing room saunas will also be closed, and jockeys’ weights will increase by 2lb both on the Flat and over jumps to help riders make their allotted weight. The new measures have been introduced after a meeting of the sport’s senior executives in Ireland on Wednesday reviewed five meetings staged behind closed doors since last Friday.“These are unprecedented and sombre times,” Nicky Hartery, the chairman of Horse Racing Ireland, said on Wednesday, “and we are seeking the best ways to support the racing community and industry throughout what lies ahead. Health and welfare of employees and industry participants is the prime consideration and within that context, we have introduced protocols which can allow racing to continue and thousands of families who rely on the sector to maintain a livelihood. This will be kept under review on a daily basis and we are also planning measures for reprogramming fixtures as it becomes required.“We have made it clear at all times that our medical facilities and personnel will be available for the Government to use if necessary. That will take precedence above any other consideration.”Brian Kavanagh, HRI’s chief executive, said that the revised programme will not be “race fixtures as we knew them” and that social distancing will be strictly enforced.“Racecourses by their nature offer opportunities for social distancing that few other workplaces can,” Kavanagh said. “Nothing in Irish life is as it was a week ago, and in the same way, these are not race fixtures as we previously knew them.“They are big open-air sites with very few people present and nobody on site if they are not involved. Once a jockey or trainer has finished their business for the afternoon, they are required to leave.Â Furthermore, we have carried out risk assessments according to each inidual racecourse facility, and some fixtures may be subject to greater restrictions and limitations to ensure social distancing is easily achievable and maintained.”French racing, which had been behind closed doors for a fortnight, cancelled its racing programme until mid-April two days ago, while the British Horseracing Authority abandoned its attempt to continue the sport without spectators on Tuesday, when all racing was cancelled until at least 30 April.Ireland, however, is determined to carry on for as long as it can, following the lead of both Hong Kong and Australia, where racing also continues behind closed doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db1c652e058bc838cdc2e8be78520a5851a0a6b/0_154_4645_2786/master/4645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddc078e268621959524bdc51f68a8c33","title":"tom brady tampa bay buccaneers nfl new england patriots football","story":"The quarterback teamed up with Bill Belichick to become a ruthless winner in New England. Tampa Bay coach Bruce Arians has a very different philosophyMontana finished in a Chiefs jersey. Jordan retired as a Wizard. Gretzky went out in New York. And now it appears Tom Brady will spend the final years of his professional career playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.I repeat: Tom Brady, he of six Super Bowls, New England Patriots fame, is departing the most successful team in modern NFL history and is all but certain to move his operation to Tampa, Florida, in order to join a team with the NFL’s third-worst record over the past decade. The Patriots went 125-35 between 2010 and 2019, winning three Super Bowls: The Buccaneers: 59-101, with zero playoff appearances.Brady leaving the Patriots to join the Bucs is as much about lifestyle as anything else. Tampa’s coach, Bruce Arians, is famed for his laidback, there’s-more-to-life-than-football style. He drinks beers in the parking lots with the players and their families after games. He threatens to fire coaches if they miss a dance recital or ballgame or a family member’s birthday. “Those years don’t come back,” Arians famously said.Arians certainly does not reflect the ruthless, win at all costs Patriot Way. For Brady, a man soon-to-be in his mid-40s, the family stuff starts to matter a whole lot more.There are football reasons for the switch, too. The Bucs have one of the best two-man receiving tandems in the sport: Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. There is also a chance Antonio Brown joins the group. He and Brady have remained in close contact, and Brown worked under Arians back in his Pittsburgh days. And you can chuck into that mix tight end OJ Howard, who is as physically gifted as any at his position in the sport, though he fell victim to Arians’ scheme – which almost vehemently opposes the use of tight-ends as pass-catchers – in the coach’s first season in Tampa.The Bucs were impressive on both sides of the ball last season, despite Jameis Winston tossing 30 interceptions. In fact, it’s likely that Brady surveyed the landscape and sought out the best possible defense rather than offense when making his decision. The Bucs defense finished fifth in DVOA last season. The other two Brady suitors? The Raiders, 31st the Chargers, 21st.The fit between coach and quarterback remains iffy. Arians is known as a fun-n-gun coach, someone who wants his quarterbacks to make long throws. When his offenses have been at their best – first in Pittsburgh and then in Arizona – it’s been when he’s had a strong-armed quarterback who could throw the ball deep down the field outside the numbers, often supplemented with a sound running game.That’s not Brady. He is a rhythm player: hit the back foot, get the ball out. Everything he does is about precision and timing. In New England, Brady was also the master of pre-snap manipulation. He controlled everything and the Patriots ran everything: two-back sets, spread-sets, motions, shifts, fullbacks, h-backs. The Patriots align players anywhere and everywhere. Players’ roles shift on a week-to-week, concept-to-concept basis. Wide receivers become ball-carriers, and they shift between inside and perimeter positions. Running backs are used as a deep threat in the passing game. It was a complex, all-encompassing system.And it all flowed through Brady. He digested each morsel of information and made sure the team used the best play possible against whichever look a defense presented. Indeed, the Patriots system was always at its best when Brady was able to jump into the no-huddle, marshaling things alone at the line of scrimmage.Adjustments flow both ways. Will Arians let Brady bring the New England blueprint with him? Will Brady welcome a shift away from a system that puts so much focus on his decision-making and timing rather than letting him just go out there and rip it?Remember: Brady will be 43 by the time the new season starts. His arm remains as strong as it’s been since the early 2010s, but, barring a wild 2007 run, throwing the ball vertically has never been his biggest strength. Will Arians be happy running a system reliant on precise, underneath routes? If it works, you would think so.But it remains an essential question the pair must figure out together. Taking deep dropbacks would be a recipe for disaster. Tampa Bay’s offensive-line ranks anywhere from solid to good by most metrics. They finished 22nd in adjusted sack rate and 16th in pressure rate. But even those numbers were slightly inflated by Winston’s, umm, ability to go off-script, break a play, and avoid sacks.Tampa’s group has talent, most notably inside. But they’re a group built for an Arians offense, not a Brady one. They maul people in the run-game then set deep in the passing game.The shift to Brady couldn’t be more radical. Brady isn’t utterly immobile, but he’s not exactly mobile either. He’s a pocket shuffler. Others bob and weave like a boxer, keeping a play alive until they scamper away or find an open teammate. Brady likes to adjust the radar of a pass-rusher by a fraction. At high speed, it feels like a world of difference. They can see still him. It looks like he’s in the same spot, but for some reason, he’s now out of range. It is exceptionally effective, but only to a point. Brady has noticeably become gun-shy in the past two seasons, chucking the ball into the dirt or throwing it away in order to avoid big hits. There were times last season where he was inching closer to the fossil most quarterbacks become at the very end.But Brady is still good. That’s important to note. Is he the Brady of old? No. But he still ranks as a league-average starter, one with a rolodex of football information stored in his brain. Wriggle his way into the post-season, and with the weapons, he has on the perimeter and a frisky Bucs defense, he would have a shot. That, along with a new challenge and a less pressurized environment, was probably what he was looking for.None of his other options were great. In Jon Gruden and the Las Vegas Raiders, he would have found a better schematic fit and someone who shares his football psychopathy. It wouldn’t have been all that much fun, though. The Los Angeles Chargers, meanwhile, are a rotating morass of mediocrity and the little brother in a city that’s yet to prove it has an appetite for professional football. In Tampa, Brady has found the best of some not-great situations. Arians is smart enough to step back or push, depending on what is needed.This move was about ego and joy. About respect. About credit, and how we, as a collective, apportion it between Brady and Belichick. Now, they will both go it alone, albeit at the back-end of their careers. Maybe Brady won’t win a Lombardi, but as a steady hand on a team with a bunch of young talent, he will surely have some fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68118a7204221496166a0ea67e95b4e9468f2385/61_0_1839_1104/master/1839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a639ac160592a4bba90cce41bb5f988d","title":"apple unveils ipad pro with 3d scanner in major redesign","story":"Top tablet has lidar tech found in self-driving cars in system designed for augmented realityApple has released a new version of its top iPad Pro with new 3D depth-sensing lidar technology and a revamped MacBook Air with a new keyboard, as it attempts to continue normal business in spite of the coronavirus pandemic.The new 11in and 12.9in iPad Pros resemble the previous major redesign made in 2018, complete with slim bezels all round and Face ID facial recognition. But they also have a new lidar-based depth sensing system, a technology typically found on self-driving cars.The lidar scanner can measure the distance of objects up to five metres away, working both indoors and outside, designed for enhanced augmented reality. The tablet also has a new ultra-wide camera and is aimed at media creation, with improved microphones and new, more powerful A12Z Bionic processor, which Apple says is more powerful than most Windows PC laptops.Alongside the iPad Pro, Apple released a new Magic Keyboard accessory, which has a traditional MacBook-like keyboard but also a trackpad that brings precision pointing to the iPad for the first time. The keyboard also has its own USB-C port and an adjustable hinge supporting the tablet at a range of angles, essentially turning it into a laptop.Trackpad support will be available for previous iPads that support the iPadOS 13.4 released on 24 March, enabling support for both Apple’s keyboards and mice, but also third-party devices via Bluetooth or USB.The new 11in and 12.9in iPad Pros will cost from £769 and £969 respectively, shipping on 25 March.Apple’s entry-level MacBook Air has also been updated, gaining the new Magic Keyboard, which was first introduced with the firm’s top 16in MacBook Pro and aims to put to bed the multiple issues associated with its butterfly keyboard introduced in 2015.The new MacBook Air starts at £999, £100 less than the previous version, shipping from 6 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/873ca2c98968dd5ba1904b977e6150f77652af57/0_108_2385_1431/master/2385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42ed490f9c371b71114a32a36723b5e","title":"facebook says spam filter mayhem not related to coronavirus","story":"Social network restores posts that were wrongly removed as system went haywireA Facebook spam filter that went haywire on Tuesday evening and began removing many perfectly acceptable posts was unrelated to coronavirus, the company has said.All the removed posts have been restored, a Facebook executive said, attributing the removals to an automated system. Despite the fact that many of the removed posts were related to the coronavirus, the company says that was simply a coincidence owing to the fact that so many posts on the site are related to the pandemic.Guy Rosen, the social network’s head of platform integrity, said: “We’ve restored all the posts that were incorrectly removed, which included posts on all topics – not just those related to Covid-19. This was an issue with an automated system that removes links to abusive websites, but incorrectly removed a lot of other posts too.”Facebook said this week it would be sending all of its contracted human moderators home. The company cannot offer remote working for its moderation staff owing to privacy considerations over the material they handle, and so its moderation work will be done exclusively by permanent employees for the foreseeable future.Facebook says the absence of human moderators was not related to the spam filter error and it believes it is well prepared for moderating the site with a vastly reduced human workforce. Kang-Xing Jin, Facebook’s head of health, said: “We believe the investments we’ve made over the past three years have prepared us for this situation. With fewer people available for human review, we’ll continue to prioritise imminent harm and increase our reliance on proactive detection in other areas to remove violating content. We don’t expect this to impact people using our platform in any noticeable way.”Facebook is not the only technology firm to have sent home its moderators. YouTube announced on Monday that it would be relying more on AI to moderate videos in the future. Unlike Facebook, the video site did not commit to the change being invisible to users. Instead, it said more videos would be taken down as a result of the lack of human oversight.Normally, YouTube videos are flagged by an AI and then sent to a human reviewer to confirm they should be taken down. But now videos will far more frequently be removed on the say of an AI alone. The company says it will not be giving creators a permanent black mark, or “strike”, if their videos are taken down without human review, since it accepts that it will inevitably end up taking down “some videos that may not violate policies”.Coronavirus-related videos are booming on YouTube, including many that spread conspiracy theories. The company has limited the amount of coronavirus-related content that any inidual moderator has to work on each day, one moderator said, in order to protect workers’ mental health. YouTube has been contacted for comment.While platforms such as YouTube and Facebook have cut moderation capacity, they still maintain the ability to remove misinformation from their sites. Other platforms, from encrypted chat services such as WhatsApp and Telegram to legacy systems including email and SMS messages, are virtually unmoderated and appear to have become the primary vector through which misinformation is spread.One video that went viral on WhatsApp, for instance, purported to show violence and panic at an Aldi in the Netherlands. In fact, according to researchers at the open-source intelligence group Bellingcat, it was a video of an unrelated crush in Germany in 2011 that had been miscaptioned on TikTok and then spread further on the messaging service.On Wednesday, WhatsApp announced its own attempts to fight misinformation, including an information hub that aims to provide “simple, actionable guidance for health workers, educators, community leaders, nonprofits, local governments and local businesses that rely on WhatsApp to communicate”. It also announced a $1m donation to the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which funds fact-checking efforts around the world.“We know that our users are reaching out on WhatsApp more than ever at this time of crisis, whether it’s to friends and loved ones, doctors to patients, or teachers to students. We wanted to provide a simple resource that can help connect people at this time,” said Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51210987c758d54672d931492ff91ce6d7f9f44a/0_272_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5dd83c5da152873caceca9116f78bfc","title":"tech execs who dont agree coronavirus measures","story":"Michael Saylor does not often send all-staff emails to the more than 2,000 employees at Microstrategy, a business intelligence firm headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia. So the chief executive’s 3,000-word missive on Monday afternoon with the subject line My Thoughts on Covid-19 got his employees’ attention.As companies around the world adjust to the reality of the coronavirus pandemic, including by allowing their employees to work from home in compliance with the national guidelines of many governments, some executives are attempting to continue doing business as usual. The trend is notable in the tech industry, where computer-based work can generally be performed from anywhere, but where the culture has often rewarded innovative and “disruptive” leaders who buck conventional wisdom.Saylor argued that the “economic damage” of social distancing and quarantines was greater than “the theoretical benefit of slowing down a virus” and suggested that it would make more sense to “quarantine the 40 million elderly retired, immune compromised people who no longer need to work or get educated”.“In the absolutely worse case, the overall life expectancy worldwide would click down by a few weeks,” he added. “Instead of 79.60 years to live we would have 79.45 years to live. 1 out of 500 people will pass on a bit sooner, or not, or die from a celebrated disease instead of just old age,” he added. “We should continue to do our work, serve our customers, educate our children, cultivate our health, pursue our hobbies, worship our gods, enjoy our sports, cherish our friends, listen to our music, eat, drink, \u0026amp be merry.”Microstrategy did not respond to numerous requests for comment.Saylor is not alone among technology executives chafing against the pressure to abide by recommendations from public health officials.Elon Musk, billionaire chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, prompted considerable consternation when he tweeted, “The coronavirus panic is dumb” to his 32.3 million followers on 6 March. Despite widespread criticism of his message, which flew in the face of public health efforts to convince the general population to take the spread of the virus seriously, Musk has continued to downplay the threat.On Tuesday, thousands of factory workers at Tesla’s plant in the San Francisco Bay area reported to work, despite a “shelter-in-place” order that was supposed to shutter all “non-essential” businesses. Musk told factory employees to stay home “if you feel the slightest bit ill or even uncomfortable”, the Los Angeles Times reported. By Tuesday afternoon, the local sheriff’s office announced that Tesla was not an essential business and could only maintain “minimum basic operations”.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request from the  for a comment.Another billionaire, venture capitalist Tim Draper, tweeted on 14 March, “The fear is far worse than the virus. The governments have it wrong. Stay open for business. If not, so many more people will die from a crashing economy than from this virus.”Draper is known for eccentric and contrarian views he supported a ballot initiative in California that aimed to ide the state into six smaller states and continued to voice support for the disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes long after she was charged with fraud.On Monday, Draper drew considerable criticism for tweeting that he was going ahead with a South by Southwest (SXSW) event for his “Draper Startup House” in Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the festival was cancelled by city officials. He subsequently apologized for his “timing” and said he supports a “2-week lockdown”.Draper did not immediately respond to the ’s request for a comment.One Silicon Valley leader who is attempting to push companies in the other direction is David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails and co-founder of Basecamp. Hansson has been using his Twitter account to “name ’n’ shame” tech employers who are not allowing employees to work remotely, going so far as to set up a dedicated email for employees to submit anonymous reports.Hansson has tweeted out the names of dozens of companies chastising them for not allowing employees to work remotely, and told the  that he has “hundreds” more reports that he is still reviewing. He has said he will delete tweets if a company changes its stance.“If you’re gathering people in the office who could work from home, you simply have no excuse and you will eventually have blood on your hands,” Hansson said. “There’s a lot of people in Silicon Valley who fancy themselves as contrarians as a default stance. They think it means you’re not with the herd, you’re special. In my opinion, every tech company that has people working in the office, they’re not contrarian, they’re stupid and they’re dangerous.”By Tuesday afternoon, Hansson had tweeted a screenshot of the Microstrategy CEO’s email, though the excerpt he highlighted did not include Saylor’s peculiar views on public health.“The current policies represent a threat to our civil liberties, economic liberties, \u0026amp physicalmental health that far exceeds the theoretical benefit of slowing down a virus,” Saylor wrote. “They will bankrupt small and large businesses, eliminate jobs, destroy assets, impoverish multitudes. If our interest is the public health, then depriving the entire population of education, jobs, sports, recreation, entertainment, assets, exercise, bars, restaurants, museums, religious ceremony, group celebrations is certainly unhealthy to them.”An employee of Microstrategy, who spoke to the  under condition of anonymity, said that many employees were working from home on Tuesday despite Saylor’s email. The email from Saylor had been “unexpected”, the employee said. “Everyone is roughly on the same page that we didn’t expect the feelings of the CEO to be if people die then it will only bring down the overall life expectancy by a small number.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e33044ab9b431f127257bd580d320579797bdd/20_0_5158_3095/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d03faa2c22f2c0f21d37f16fab0497","title":"readers tips visit wildlife nature reserve uk sawdays stay","story":"Whether it’s a wetlands, mountainside, coastal fringe, forest or heath … share details of your favourite UK nature reserveAs with all attractions, some wildlife reserves may be closed during the coronavirus outbreak.

Check websites before setting offLike so many bucolic places in this part of Wales, Colby has played a role in the region’s industrial history. You’ll see entrances to a capped-off coal mine on your rambles and an old mine track leads to the coast – a lovely walk, bringing you out on to Amroth’s sandy beach (where a petrified forest can sometimes be seen at low tide), with views across Carmarthen Bay to Worm’s Head at the tip of the Gower Peninsula.The Bothy tearoom, shop and walled garden are closed, but the toilets remain open.Chris MossWith 250 acres of parkland and gardens, this rolling estate by the River Ouse is, I’ve always found, a great place for losing myself on an idle ramble. Dating back to Saxon times, it was landscaped by Capability Brown in the 18th century, lost to agriculture, then wonderfully restored and opened to the public 12 years ago. Four picturesque ponds are the site of an annual waterlily festival in MayJune (fingers crossed for this year). They’re a delight in spring too – go now and you’ll see them girded by uplifting displays of colour including rafts of daffodils and delicate snake’s head fritillaries. But to really get away from it all, take the undulating three-mile hike around the estate (maps available from reception) to enjoy some of the finest parkland views in Sussex.

You could watch it a million times in a row and Armando Iannucci’s political satire would still maintain its bite. If you haven’t seen it since the altogether more slick Veep, you might be taken aback by how joyously ramshackle this cheap little no-risk BBC Four sitcom feels. But that is part of its charm. When Malcolm Tucker bares his teeth for the first time in the first scene of the first episode, it is like stumbling across a found-footage horror film. It’s nightmarish. You might not think now is a good time to watch a show about the incompetent failings of national government. But, if you have the stomach for it, there’s nothing better. Stuart HeritageThey’re here, they’re queer, and they’re about to get you a whole new wardrobe (and house!). The Queer Eye reboot – helmed by the fab five of Jonathan, Antoni, Karamo, Tan and Bobby – saw the 00s makeover show get a whole new lease of life, via questionable avocado recipes and incredible interior design. By focusing more closely on the inner struggles of its participants, helping people who had seemingly fallen through the cracks to regain their confidence, and rectify the areas which needed fixing in their lives – from broken relationships to coming out – it became “more than a makeover”. If the Japanese spinoff felt like overkill, there are still four other series to blitz through. Hannah J DaviesSkyNow TV Given what it was – a mystery show with no real intention of answering its own mystery, made by a figure who specialises in deliberately oblique storytelling – the original Twin Peaks was a blockbuster of a show, with an old-school riddle at its heart. A girl died. A good-hearted stranger comes to town to investigate. Then weirdness ensues. But, at least to my mind, the 2017 sequel has now become the definitive Twin Peaks. Aggressively avant garde in places, and truly terrifying in others, it is like nothing else that has ever been on television. It is not an easy watch by any means. In fact, sometimes it is downright maddening. But nevertheless, it will affect you in ways you didn’t think you could be affected.

Set in the “hey!”-day of the wild west, with a host of real-life historical figures such as Wyatt Earp and Calamity Jane popping in and out of its small South Dakota town, Deadwood’s stellar reputation never translated into viewing figures, leading to its premature cancellation after three seasons. Luckily, the storylines were rounded out in a feature-length special last year, making now the perfect time to appreciate this thoroughly modern western. Ian McShane chews the scenery as the saloon owner Al Swearengen, but it is Timothy Olyphant, playing the long-suffering sheriff, who holds it all together. If you are not hooked after the first four episodes, culminating in the depiction of the real-life murder of Wild Bill Hickok (an all-too-brief turn from Keith Carradine), there is something wrong with you. And if all else fails, just count the F-bombs there are 43 in the first hour alone. Toby MosesNetflix It may have been created for a pre-streaming world, but there are few sitcoms as binge-friendly as the Bluth family’s madcap saga. Stuffed to the gills with callbacks and inter-show references, Arrested Development benefits hugely from back-to-back (and repeat) viewing – and the impressive gag-rate and endlessly ridiculous narrative accelerations mean the episodes simply fly by. Masterminded by The Ellen Show co-creator Mitchell Hurwitz, Arrested Development began airing in 2003, with three near-peerless seasons before it was cancelled, only to be resurrected for two more disappointing outings on Netflix. Nonetheless, we will always have those early years tracing the many trials (sometimes literally) of the extremely rich, extremely entitled and extremely eccentric Newport Beach crew. Cue layers of cartoonish plotlines, catchphrases galore and a veritable labyrinth of addictively quotable in-jokes not to mention some of greatest slapstick that television comedy has ever seen. Rachel AroestiNetflix A true millennial phenomenon. The idea of a feminist musical sitcom that majors on mental health issues might cause eyes to roll. But don’t switch over to Friends just yet. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is hilarious, pioneering and eminently watchable. It has caused controversy since first being aired in 2015, chronicling the life struggles of its main character Rebecca (played wonderfully by its writer-creator Rachel Bloom) – from her obsessive fixations and borderline personality disorder, to suicide attempts and abortions – all with a sunny musical theatre soundtrack. What could be heavy, dramatic fare, is dealt with confidently, accompanied by a righteous wink the Cats special is a thing to behold, and Period Sex will be stuck in your head for weeks. Bloom has been nominated for multiple Emmies, Glaad awards and Golden Globes for her performance, and rightly so – she shines. But the supporting cast are beautifully played, too, with one of the most authentic portrayals of bisexuality ever put to screen in Pete Gardner’s Darryl Whitefeather. Dylan B JonesAll dressed up with nowhere to go? Then try Next in Fashion, the Netflix reality show in which already competent and semi-established designers, stuck in the shadows of their big-name bosses, get to compete in front of an impressive array of fashion insiders, from Christopher Kane to Phillip Lim. Better still, its focus on bringing people up rather than putting them down offers a welcome reprieve from the more typically brutal world of TV talent competitions, and presenters Alexa Chung and Tan France provide warm, supportive, well-tailored shoulders to cry on. Plus, you don’t have to wait 10 weeks to find out who the winner will be the duo very much urge you to binge this, with a reminder to press “next episode” at the end of every episode. Rebecca NicholsonAll4 Between 2004 and 2013 the writer Paul Abbott embedded us in Manchester’s Chatsworth council estate, with the sprawling, chaotic Gallagher family, headed up – nominally – by their drunkard dad Frank (David Threlfall) and, actually, by his eldest daughter Fiona (Anne-Marie Duff). So much good came from the Gallaghers: Fiona’s unutterably sweet on-screen romance with Steve led to the real-life marriage of Duff and co-star James McAvoy Maxine Peake built her reputation as fearsome neighbour Veronica, and stories were told about British working-class life without condescension or judgment. Are the Gallaghers the type of family to have a coat of arms? Probably not. But if they were, its motto would read: “Honi soit qui mal y pense” – Shame on those who see shame in it. Ellen E JonesThere are so many things about Sex Education that may irritate at first. Why does the school look so American – right down to the lettered bomber jackets – despite being set (and filmed) in rural Britain? For that matter, why film in Wales yet feature no one with a Welsh accent? And let’s not forget that hardy perennial: why do most of its teenagers look about 30? (Answer: because they are.) But be patient get past that. The show may attempt to lure you in with Inbetweeners-style crudeness, but it unfolds into a thoughtful, well-paced comedy drama, with an almost public-service zeal for exploring the issues around sex and relationships with sensitivity and warmth. There is, of course, the show’s breakout star too, Ncuti Gatwa (real age 27). He has become a meme as lead character Otis’s out-and-proud gay best friend, Eric, and is now a rather unexpected spokesperson for the coronavirus pandemic, with his line after spotting another character leaving the toilets without washing their hands doing more to stop the spread of the virus than any Boris Johnson press conference: “Wash your hands, you detty pig.” Scott BryaniPlayer There are few voices more soothing than David Attenborough’s, and here he narrates what must be one of the greatest nature documentaries of all time, and certainly the most visually stunning. While its 2017 sequel (also on iPlayer) played a vital role in shifting attitudes towards plastic pollution around the world, it started here, with the the original Blue Planet in 2001, which took five years to make and is still one of Attenborough’s career highlights. The sheer beauty of all that it uncovered is wonderfully escapist in itself (episode two, The Deep, is a psychedelic wonder), and at a pinch, it may also provide just a little of what’s needed in times like these: travel without travelling, education without crowds, and a reminder of the respect we must have for the unforgiving power of nature. Rebecca NicholsonMalorie Blackman’s hit young adult series arrived earlier this month, its tale of star-crossed lovers separated because of their races and backgrounds seeming more urgent as bigotry continues its worrying resurgence. Over six episodes – all of which are available to stream now – this Romeo and Juliet in a race-reversed society draws you into a world where the microagressions and discrimination frequently suffered by people of colour are drawn into sharp relief, and the lines between rich and poor are more pronounced than ever. Besides this, it is also a gripping tale of families with hidden secrets, changing allegiances and, of course, love. Peaky Blinders’ Jack Rowan and newcomer Masali Baduza are captivating as the leads, while Paterson Joseph is among its strong ensemble. Hannah J DaviesSky GoNowTVAmazon Prime Video Modern Family is a show you can bond with, settling into and going the distance with its 10 series. Those 200-plus episodes, along with the ongoing 11th and final series, make the story of various factions of the Pritchett clan – including a gay couple with a daughter, introduced to a mainstream American audience as part of the happy warp and weft of normal suburban life – one of the longest running sitcoms in television history. Of course there have been peaks and troughs in that time, but it has always been of standout quality, with laugh-a-line scenes, some of which are so light and fleet that you barely catch them skimming past you, making every episode ripe for rewatching. Lucy ManganAs podcasts become ever more popular, so the number of pods that have been made into TV series continues to grow, from Homecoming (Amazon Prime Video) to Limetown (Facebook Watch). Chief among them is Dirty John, adapted from the hit Wondery show about a devious, bedraggled conman who wormed his way into the life of a moneyed businesswoman, Debra Newell, by posing as a successful anaesthesiologist (he was in fact a former nurse anaesthetist who had spent time in prison for fraud). The total gall displayed by John Meehan – as he attempted a Parasite-esque takeover of Newell’s life – would be enough to stun most people. But, combined with a helping of Netflix melodrama, it makes for a particularly shocking, if knowingly cheesy, watch. Hannah J DaviesAmazon Prime VideoThis Zooey Deschanel vehicle has two main things going for it. First, it is funny. Second, there are a lot of episodes. I adopted New Girl as my back-up binge show a couple of years ago, dropping in and out when there wasn’t anything exciting on, and I still haven’t made it to the finale. The best thing about an ensemble sitcom such as New Girl is that – if you hang in there for long enough – all the characters have their time to shine. Schmidt is the breakout character, but then he is eclipsed by the ornery Nick. And then, out of nowhere, Winston becomes the absurdist one who holds the whole show together. This is a series so egalitarian that even Megan Fox is able to become its funniest thing for a decent stretch of episodes. Stuart HeritageIncreasingly, you can just stroll down to your local supermarket to achieve an effect comparable to watching Russell T Davies’s 2019 future-shock family saga. With its grim projections about rampant populism, accelerating climate crisis, the madness of crowds and the bewildering pace of technological change, Years and Years felt worryingly on the nose when it aired last year. Suffice to say, its vision hasn’t got much more comforting in the meantime. But as horrifying – and frequently plausible – as the travails of the Lyons family were, the show does, eventually, speak to resilience and continuity. By the skin of their teeth, and not without a couple of casualties, the family keeps it together. And so, just about, does the country. Phil HarrisonNetflixThe sitcom previously known as Scrotal Recall was always far better than a show with that painful pun as a name had any right to be. But with a new moniker, and a shift to Netflix, fresh life was breathed into the tale of four twentysomethings navigating friendship, relationships and STIs post university. The laughs may be gentle, but the writing by Tom Edge is subtle and the characters well drawn, with Johnny Flynn (brother of Jerome) leading the cast as the chlamydia-infected Dylan tracking down his previous conquests to break the news. It’s a neat conceit, and the will theywon’t they romance with Antonia Thomas’s Evie is in the greatest of sitcom traditions – and far less frustrating when watched in one go. Toby MosesAll4The cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a feelgood proposition on every level. It is a properly funny comedy. It is undemanding moreish fare. It has charm, it has warmth, it has heart. Its characters are fundamentally united, chafing and rubbing together enough to strike comic sparks but essentially hanging together in the fight against the villainry. True antipathy or hostility has no place here. But best of all, and most valuably perhaps in our current times, it also shows every sign of the ensemble cast being free of it, too. It is impossible to know for sure, of course – the set may be a hotbed of hatred and warring egos – but one feels that the easy camaraderie on display is impossible to fake entirely. Add to that the joy of seeing Andre Braugher – Frank freaking Pembleton from Homicide: Life on the Streets, people! – in a light comic role and all that it left to say is, of course, NOICE! Lucy ManganAmazon Prime VideoBritBoxThey don’t, in so many senses, make them like this any more. ITV’s 1981 version of Evelyn Waugh’s 1945 novel was, with its 11-hour running time, not far off granting the wish of those viewers who like dramatisations to include every word of the book. That meant the world Waugh conjured – fading nobility, eccentric inter-war hedonism and grassy afternoons at a perfectly proper Oxford University – could be allowed to completely envelop the viewer. In the days before the big US box-set beasts, Brideshead Revisited was routinely cited as the best TV show of all time. In part, that was due to the exquisite score, the sky-high production values and the brilliant cast. But its appeal has always been mainly as a door to a fantasy of a bygone world. That’s now perhaps more valuable than ever. Jack SealeMaking a followup to Peep Show was always going to be tough for its writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and shorn of the natural comedic chemistry of Mitchell and Webb you might find yourself wondering where all the laughs have gone. But this is not a sitcom – it sits in that weird half-space, not quite a drama, not quite a comedy – where so many TV shows flounder. Yet Fresh Meat pulls through with a hugely talented young cast bringing to life a collection of university misfits adjusting to house-sharing – and hinted at the drama chops of Armstrong, who would go on to write Succession without his long-time collaborator. Jack Whitehall impresses as the posh dimwit best avoided in the uni bar, while Zawe Ashton’s beautifully surreal turn as Vod never fails to entertain, even if the thrill is somewhat diminished in the latter series when the character is pushed to the emotional forefront. Across four series, we see the characters mature, regress and mature again – before it reaches its natural endpoint with graduation.

When it becomes apparent that Koji is a trained doctor but cannot work here while he is seeking asylum, the pair strike up an agreement of free food for Koji in return for informal consultations, which bring in more cafe customers. Happy days: Koji gets to eat and Kate gets to have her icy prejudices slowly thawed by his unwavering good nature and illegal practice. It’s as if the Good Immigrant had never been published.Filmed in front of a live audience on a cafe stage set, the show’s claustrophobic aesthetics, kitsch slapstick and jarringly loud laughter hark back to the likes of Open All Hours and Dad’s Army, as well as more recent iterations of the multi-camera format in Mrs Brown’s Boys or Miranda. Even the Baker Street-style saxophone melody and panning opening credits feel like a throwback to Only Fools and Horses.Of course, the retro references are intentional, even tongue-in-cheek, yet if the premise and setting feel dated, the writing should surely serve to cannily subvert this. Instead, the the script is more stale than the cafe’s beige wallpaper a bland pastiche leaning so heavily on stereotypes as to make every character a caricature: the prejudiced old-timer, the good immigrant, the village idiots.The groan-worthy jokes include jibes at Meera Syal’s doctor ordering a flat white with oat milk (only the metropolitan liberal elite drink coffee) a (presumably foreign) call-centre worker mispronouncing Kate’s name and a particularly egregious one-liner on multi-gendered toilets that gets one of the loudest laughs of the second episode. In fact, both sides lose in this sloppy writing Kate’s character is so poorly drawn as to make her a personification of a progressive’s nightmares, while Koji is so formal and austere as to make him a version of Morgan Freeman’s Hoke in Driving Miss Daisy. There is little space for Bleythyn’s formidable talent to shine, nor are there nuances enough for Akingbola to humanise his portrayal of Koji.Created by the writing team behind the deft family comedy Outnumbered – Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin – it seems that tackling anything beyond middle-class domestic life has proved too much for them. At best, Kate \u0026amp Koji scrapes close to Channel 4’s toothless take on the Syrian refugee influx, Home. At worst, it brings to mind the offensive stereotyping of Love Thy Neighbour and Mind Your Language, two 1970s sitcoms that tried to tackle racial culture-clash with unsympathetic, clumsily racist, overtones.Why is ITV funding a modern-day rehash of shows that, even in their prime half a century ago, were noted for their insensitivity and narrow-sightedness? There have been far better, more nuanced portrayals recently on our screens. Take Ramy, an ingenious look at being a young Muslim in America, written by one – Ramy Youssef – or Don’t Forget the Driver, a BBC Two tragicomedy where Toby Jones plays a coach driver who comes upon a Calais stowaway.In these shows, ersity is a human, tangible part of the fabric of everyday life, even if it is contested and difficult. It is not an exotic occurrence that magically lands on the doorstep of your cafe, asking to be let in.• Kate and Koji is on tonight, 8pm, ITV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05b4475a31d1582756e996e94a33d50642d9c28/0_168_3822_2293/master/3822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d4a1ae46fc445725da47b6a7c19fd28","title":"2020 four states primaries coronavirus election","story":"Joe Biden swept three key primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday night, dominating a third consecutive week of elections as he built a nearly indomitable lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.His resounding victories all but eliminated a path for his rival, Bernie Sanders, whose campaign is at a crossroads as he contemplates whether to stay in a fight for the liberal agenda he has championed for decades, or to exit and help Democrats unify the party behind his opponent as the country faces a public health crisis.After the win, Biden made an overture to Sanders’ supporters, as he seeks to add to his lead. Biden said he and Sanders shared common goals, regarding healthcare, inequality and the climate crisis.“So let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you. I know what’s at stake,” Biden said, in a a livestream video posted after the Florida and Illinois results were declared.“I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party, and then to unify the nation.”Sanders has far more support than Biden among young voters, who are more likely to be skeptical of Biden’s incremental approach. Biden’s victories came as Donald Trump formally sealed the Republican presidential nomination, surpassing the necessary delegate threshold after facing no significant opposition.Tuesday’s elections underscored the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic presidential primary amid a global outbreak that has closed borders, roiled the economy and touched nearly every corner of public life. Ohio, which was also due to vote on Tuesday, postponed its elections, defying a court order and closing polls, even as Florida, Illinois and Arizona moved forward despite pressure to delay their contests.Before polls closed on Tuesday, Sanders delivered an address responding to the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. He predicted the US government would ultimately spend $2tn “to prevent deaths, job losses and to avoid an economic catastrophe” and called for every American household to receive monthly payments of $2,000 during the crisis.“Our country and our world are facing an unprecedented series of crises,” he said in remarks that made no reference to the election.More than 6,300 Americans have tested positive for the virus, despite limited testing, with 108 deaths as of Tuesday evening. The message from officials is that the outbreak will worsen dramatically.On Monday, Trump advised Americans not to gather in groups of more than 10, further restricting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended that no gatherings with 50 people or more be held for the next eight weeks.Against that backdrop, Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, announced on Monday afternoon that he would seek to postpone the election until 2 June. Hours later an Ohio county judge rejected the request, saying it would set a “terrible” precedent.DeWine instructed the state’s director of health to declare a public health emergency. He argued that holding the election would place voters and poll workers in potential danger.“We should not force people to make this choice, a choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens,” DeWine said at a press conference, adding: “I think when we look back on this, we are going to be glad we did this.”Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, assailed the move for causing “more chaos and confusion” and sought to discourage other states from following suit.But it may be too late. Louisiana and Georgia were the first states to announce they would delay their primaries in response to the outbreak. Kentucky joined Ohio on Monday, choosing to delay its primary from 19 May to 23 June. And on Tuesday, Maryland became the fifth state to postpone its presidential primary election, moving it from 28 April to 2 June.Officials in Florida, Arizona and Illinois took additional precautions to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers, including sanitizing voting machines and offering curbside voting. But there were reports of poll worker shortages and confusion over polling locations.The virus has reshaped the 2020 election campaign in other ways. Trump is not holding his signature rallies and the Democratic candidates, both in their late 70s, are forgoing big gatherings, opting instead to hold virtual town halls and live-streamed events. On the eve of the latest primaries, Sanders participated in a digital rally from his hometown of Burlington, while Biden held a “tele-town hall”.The election delays have added another layer of unpredictability to a primary that has seen months of twists and surprises. Simon Rosenberg, a veteran consultant and the president of the New Democrat Network and the New Policy Institute, said coronavirus presented an “unprecedented” challenge for the party.“Democrats now must to find a way to complete this primary given the uncertainty of when each state is going to vote and whether we’re even going to be able to have a convention in July,” he said.Padding his delegate lead further, Biden was also finally declared the winner of last week’s primary in Washington, a state Sanders hoped to win.In his remarks on Tuesday night, Biden made an explicit appeal to Sanders’ loyal supporters.“I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do,” he said. “Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate, is to unify this party and unify this nation.“Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said, before running through a list of issues Sanders and his supporters have championed, including healthcare, income inequality and the climate crisis.Daniel Strauss and Adam Gabbatt contributed to this story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a66f640eea6d76094eedff2192a3e21f96a48eb0/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7925872037c44f74eedf3d40d6fbc1bb","title":"pandemic primary florida poll worker coronavirus","story":"A poll worker talks about voting during a pandemic, and what happens when social responsibility clashes with civic dutyWhen a primary takes place during a pandemic, civic duty clashes with social responsibility. Everybody should stay in. Everybody should vote.I’m 22 years old. I’m pretty healthy. I called the supervisor of elections office. One hour later, I was at the office undergoing deputy training. Deputies are the people who stand by the entrance telling people to take out their IDs and silence their phones. They keep the peace, which I suppose would be a lot easier not during a pandemic.On Saturday, I was assigned to a precinct. On Monday, the clerk called me to tell me to be there Tuesday at 6am and that she was bringing chicken soup. On election day, I loaded my own hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and isopropyl alcohol into my backpack and headed to the church that would be my home for the next 16 hours.I was happy to see the supervisor of elections office had provided our site with ample hand sanitizer, hydrogen peroxide, paper towels, gloves and even a spray bottle with alcohol.My first job was putting up the “no soliciting” sign, which state law mandates has to be 150ft away from the entrance of the polling site. I was supplied with a 150ft rope and set off, with one end to the door handle of the entrance. I really don’t know how I managed to tangle the brand new rope as I unwrapped it but I know that I will never feel as bad about tangling my headphones from now on.Then we set up signs marking accessible parking, signs helping point people toward the entrance, signs telling people to turn off their phones and so on.When we opened at 7am, there was a line of people who hoped to beat the crowd by coming early. As the day went on, some people came with gloves and masks. Others held their driver’s licenses through plastic bags, napkins and receipts. Several asked to use their own pens.While posted outside, I propped open the doors to circumvent to save voters from having to interact with one more “high-touch” surface. Every 15 minutes, I sanitized the guardrails by the steps leading to the door.After a moment of ine inspiration, I placed “I voted” stickers on the ground, six feet apart from each other so when a line formed, it would conform to the principle of social distancing. Nothing says “social distancing” like spending your day interacting with almost 300 strangers, right?Over the course of the day, I had four bowls of chicken soup and countless packets of fruit gummies. The people who passed through our polling site were grateful and thanked us for “risking it”. They were jittery and cautious but also determined to cast their ballot. They were relieved when they saw that we were taking hygiene and social distancing seriously.At final count, 280 people voted at our station before I closed the doors at 7pm. We spent the next two hours cleaning up and completing paperwork.There was a lot of pushback toward the state of Florida for holding elections during a pandemic as opposed to delaying like other states. It’s hard to say if it was the right decision, as conditions may very well worsen in the future. But looking back on today, I am proud to have served as a poll worker. We did everything we could to mitigate risk to those who wanted to make their voice heard.These are trying times that have tested everything that we used to take for granted. I don’t think I’ll ever see voting in the same light, now that I’ve seen all the people who put in countless hours and, in this election, put their health at risk in order to keep a polling location open.Zachariah Chou is a political science senior at the University of Florida"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4f60beaf02c889cc43c587626dacdf961d7639/505_975_6561_3937/master/6561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=251433f3cb61be81b5ae741679f73530","title":"have you recovered from the coronavirus","story":"If you have been tested positive for the virus and have since recovered, we would like to hear about your experience We’d like to hear from people who have tested positive for coronavirus but have since recovered.

We had no delay,” he added.The Iranian government finally closed religious sites and mosques this week after weeks of criticism. “It was difficult of course to shut down mosques and holy sites, but we did it. It was a religious duty to do it,” Rouhani said.It comes as a report from Iran’s Sharif University states that if Iranians did not cooperate with government guidelines the outbreak is likely to peak in June and cause 3.5 million deaths.Belgium is the latest country to go into lockdown, with citizens asked to stay at home and limit contact to their closest family.From noon local time (CET) on Wednesday, all non-essential shops and open-air markets closed and people will be expected to work at home.

The World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the symptoms as experiencing either:No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 18 March, more than 198,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 7,950 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 79,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk cases how many are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

While the number of new confirmed cases across South Korea has stayed below 100 for three days in a row, these makeshift testing centres are spearheading efforts to contain new and worrying clusters of the virus.Outside the Koreana Building, where an insurance company call centre has produced the capital’s biggest number of infections, medical staff in protective gear work quickly, occasionally pausing to remind people queuing outside not to stand too close to each other.No one complains about the wait, with one young man offering to change places with an older woman standing several places behind him.Now and then, gasps can be heard from inside the tent, as another person reacts with surprise at having a swab inserted into their nostrils.In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed in other virus-hit countries, South Koreans are, for the most part, staying calm. There have been no reports of hoarding, and the only people queuing are either waiting to be tested or to buy face masks.Since South Korea confirmed its first case of the virus on 20 January, health authorities have turned to technology, testing and social distancing in an attempt to contain the outbreak. The WHO this week urged all countries to test aggressively, citing South Korea and Taiwan’s success at limiting coronavirus infections.But authorities remain on high alert amid new clusters of infections. A new outbreak emerged at a nursing home in the hardest-hit city of Daegu this week, with 74 positive cases, and another 55 were tied to a church south of Seoul.The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to reassure a nervous public with daily briefings to explain how the virus has spread in the past 24 hours and what measures have been taken in response. It is, many people agree, a welcome show of transparency in uncertain times.The practice of sending smartphone alerts informing people of an infected person’s previous movements has sparked concerns about personal privacy, however, with the Korean human rights commission advising health authorities to withhold personal information unless it is essential to containing the virus.Technology and testing aside, some have attributed South Korea’s success in slowing the spread to avoiding minpye - causing trouble to others. That is thought to have been behind the decision by the leaders of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and River of Grace Church to apologise – albeit belatedly – for their followers’ role in spreading the virus during the early stage of the outbreak.By retracing how someone came to be infected, South Korean authorities have been able to give the public details about new infections and identify infection clusters early on.After an employee at the call centre tested positive, authorities quickly set up a tent to test everyone who worked or lived in the Koreana Building, as well those had visited the premises.South Korea has tested more than 250,000 people since the outbreak began, and has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day. It has conducted 3,692 tests per million people, compared with five per million in the US.South Korea has also pioneered “drive-thru” tests, which allow people to be tested without leaving their vehicles – a system that also means health workers do not have to disinfect the premises after each test.One hospital in Seoul has gone a step further, developing a “walk-thru” test in which people sit inside a transparent cubicle while a medical worker collects a sample, using gloves attached to the front panel. This approach speeds up the testing process and minimises the risk to medical staff.If a doctor suspects someone needs to be tested – if they have recently returned from China, had contact with someone known to be infected or belong to an at-risk group, for example – the procedure is done free of charge.People who do not belong to those categories but wish to be tested are charged 160,000 won (£105) and reimbursed if the result is positive, with the government footing the bill for any treatment they receive.In addition, people who are self-isolating, including those who have yet to test positive, each receive 454,900 won a month to cover basic living expenses.While the government has won praise for its transparency, infected people are afraid of being stigmatised.Ambulance drivers sent to collect people in isolation who then test positive do not switch on their sirens and park a discreet distance from their homes, so as not to alarm other residents.“They are victims of an illness, and anyone can get infected, but some people will become alarmed if they hear the siren and discover that we’re there to collect a coronavirus patient,” Young-woo Lee, a paramedic, told the . “Some infected people have apologised to us all the way to the hospital for causing trouble.”South Korea’s response to Covid-19 has not been seamless, however.The health and welfare minister, Park Neung-hoo, was accused of ignoring advice on social distancing by holding a meeting of the heads of large hospitals at a restaurant in Seoul last week.Park, who was photographed without a mask and shaking hands with 23 hospital directors, is now in self-isolation, along with seven other ministry officials, after one of the attendees was found to be infected.“What is the point of ordinary citizens trying our best when government officials are meeting in restaurants without masks and shaking hands?” said Seoul resident Seung-Jin park, as he queued up outside a pharmacy to buy masks, purchases of which are now limited to two per week per person. “Do they have noodles for brains?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ad5f225b5b75d66a126e67ead62b6a4ddb23a8/118_0_3312_1987/master/3312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80f7232f7f7cb63010bb9eaa3569632d","title":"health workers targeted at least 120 times yemen conflict","story":"Analysis reveals devastating impact from warring parties on country’s hospitals and doctors Hospitals and doctors in Yemen have been targeted at least 120 times by the conflict’s warring parties, according to a report that gives the most comprehensive analysis to date of the devastating effect of war on the country’s healthcare system.There were 120 incidents across 20 of Yemen’s 22 govern​orates between March 2015 and December 2018, including airstrikes, ground attacks, military occupation, assaults on health workers and other violations such as looting and restrictions on humanitarian aid, according to analysis co-published by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) and the Yemeni human rights group Mwatana on Wednesday.The findings come as a relative lull in the violence appears to have ended and Yemen’s already decimated medical sector is bracing for the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak.The collapse of Yemen’s healthcare system has been a major contributing factor in creating what the UN says is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, with two thirds of the 28 million-strong population dependent on aid to survive, widespread hunger and outbreaks of cholera and diptheria.“What our report shows is how blatantly international humanitarian law has been ignored in Yemen’s conflict and how in particular attacking healthcare facilities has a long-term and wide-reaching impact,” said Osamah Alfakih, Mwatana’s advocacy director, who co-authored the report.“All the warring parties have displayed a sustained recklessness for civilian life.”Interviews with nearly 200 survivors and eyewitnesses identified patterns of attacks and specific violations that killed at least 96 civilians and healthcare workers and injured 230 more.The report could be used in future war crimes investigations against the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore the exiled Yemeni government, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and various other armed groups.The report also criticises the coalition for a lack of transparency in its operations, adding that “it remains unclear what precautions the coalition has adopted to minimise harm to Yemen’s health facilities and personnel”.Among its recommendations the investigation says the UK, US, Canada, France and other countries currently facilitating weaponry and support to the coalition should immediately suspend sales contingent on respect for international humanitarian law in the coalition’s Yemen operations and comprehensive efforts to investigate alleged crimes and violations.The use of mortars and artillery by the Houthis and other non-state actors in Yemen in densely populated areas has also damaged and destroyed healthcare facilities, the report said, while Houthi occupation of such buildings pointed to a more deliberate violation of their protected status.Attacks on hospitals and clinics have closed more than half of Yemen’s pre-war facilities and the constant threat of being targeted makes it very difficult for doctors and nurses to work, Alfakih said.Al-Thawra hospital in Taiz was the target of at least 45 documented attacks by several parties, including ground-launched attacks, armed incursions and looting. In August 2015, the facility was targeted eight times and hit with 22 shells in two days.“Even those hospitals that remain open lack specialists, equipment and medicine. We currently only have 10 healthcare workers per 10,000 people instead of the standard 22. If one medical worker is arrested, injured or killed that has a huge knock-on effect,” Alfakih said.“There are very brave healthcare professionals working in Yemen right now. Even if they don’t talk about how tired they are, the toll is clear in their faces and their eyes.”The analysis of the state of Yemen’s healthcare infrastructure comes amid heavy fighting in al-Jawf province after months of relative quiet that many hoped could lead to a more permanent de-escalation in the conflict.Coalition airstrikes in al-Jawf launched in retaliation after the Houthis shot down a warplane killed more than 30 civilians last month. On 1 March, the Houthis seized al-Jawf’s capital, al-Hazm, sending tens of thousands of people fleeing to neighbouring Marib.On Tuesday, Saudi state media reported that the coalition destroyed two explosive-laden boats in the Red Sea launched and remotely controlled by the Houthis from the coastal region of Hodeidah.Worries are also mounting that Covid-19 could have a catastrophic impact if it reaches vulnerable communities in Yemen.This week the International Rescue Committee (IRC) launched an emergency campaign to raise $30m (£25m) to help refugees, people displaced in their own countries and those living in nations with weak health systems respond to the coronavirus pandemic.The virus could “thrive in active war zones like Yemen and Syria, putting the lives of thousands of civilians in even more danger,” said the IRC president, David Miliband."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b360b92f7fead5c735a312fad5c4d85869b7c80e/0_305_2547_1527/master/2547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91494b05fe3e632088b107b95833aac5","title":"how uk government could support people as coronavirus spreads","story":"Pressure is mounting to offer financial aid for tenants and self-employed in particularPressure is mounting on the government to provide emergency financial support for people, and renters in particular, after the chancellor promised to provide £350bn in assistance for businesses as the coronavirus outbreak spreads.Rishi Sunak said he would take further steps, promising to do “whatever it takes” to shore up confidence in the British economy, and that he was holding talks with business and unions to develop new forms of employment support. Here are some key questions:The government is offering mortgage payment holidays that will benefit homeowners, but tenants, most of whom have no savings, also need urgent help if they lose their job. Likely short-term solutions could be much faster access to improved housing benefits, now wrapped into universal credit. It can take five weeks before benefits are paid out. They are also disqualified from housing benefits if they have savings over £16,000.Current benefit levels may have to be temporarily increased so that tenants are able to pay their rent in full. A single unemployed person over 25 is currently eligible for £323 a month or about £73 a week basic benefit. They also receive help with their rent although in most cases they won’t get the full amount that they pay their landlord, says the advice group Turn2Us. This is because the amount of rent payable to claimants is set locally, and varies according to the local housing allowance.The campaign group Generation Rent is calling for a temporary halt to all section 21 “no fault” evictions and section 8 evictions for rent arrears. It wants the five-week wait for housing benefit removed, and for rents to be frozen for a year.Council tax will be another issue. The government may be looking at ways local authorities can delay demands for payment, or suspend it for a short-term period.Housing associations have already promised not to evict any tenant because of coronavirus, and are calling on the government to urgently strengthen the welfare system so tenants can get help quickly.Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said: “No one should be evicted because of the coronavirus. We are confident that no housing association will do this, and want anyone affected by the outbreak to be reassured they will not be evicted.“We urge the government to further strengthen the welfare system to ensure that everyone who needs it can quickly get help if their income drops,” she added.There are 2.6 million buy-to-let landlords in the UK, but their mortgages are not part of the “payment holiday” measures introduced by the banks. If there is widespread non-payment of rent by tenants losing their jobs, landlords are likely to default on their loans and possibly be repossessed, and the tenants evicted.The Residential Landlords Association wants landlords to be given the same access to payment holidays as conventional mortgage holders.Some but by no means all landlords will have bought insurance which includes rental guarantees. Direct Line, for example, has a deal that promises to “provide cover for any unpaid rent if you have to repossess your property. If your tenants can’t pay, we will.” Quite how that will work in this crisis is unclear – especially as the landlord can only claim on the policy if they have issued a section 21 eviction notice.Employers must pay statutory sick pay worth £94.25 a week to employees, including agency workers. Workers need to earn £118 a week to qualify. The prime minister has shortened the period for the payment of statutory sick pay from day four of illness to day one, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.According to research from Close Brothers Asset Management, supporting just half of Britain’s wage bill would cost the government about £40bn a month. “This is the sort of protection that might be required to ensure that when we come out the other side, consumer demand returns to pre-crisis levels and the economy isn’t damaged beyond repair,” said Robert Alster, the head of investment management at the firm.The CIPD says there is a strong case for eligibility for statutory sick pay to be temporarily expanded to help the self-employed.Out-of-work benefits are worth less than sick pay, while cuts imposed in the past decade of austerity have reduced the level of support. The government made changes at the budget to expand eligibility for universal credit, while employment and support allowance – the benefit for those with health conditions – will be made available from day one rather than eight.However, there are demands for the government to go further and to provide grants instead of loans to new universal credit claimants, who need to wait five weeks until their first payment comes through.In the US, the Trump administration is looking at sending cheques worth at least $1,000 (£915) directly to American citizens, in a form of “helicopter money” to boost the economy.Britain may lack a mechanism to easily make such payments. Andy King, a member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told MPs at a hearing of the Treasury committee on Monday that the government considered such a policy during the 2008 financial crisis, but lacked the mechanism to make the payments. The government paying people’s utility bills or council tax could be easier.Paul Donovan, the chief economist of the Swiss bank UBS, said the support might not be the best use of taxpayers’ money. “A $1,000 cheque buys lots of toilet rolls. In a lockdown, it does not save jobs at a bar or cinema. Cash for consumers focuses on phase two – supporting the bounceback.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87edd890074c21fdde9e4cf7ac64bf418e6b0ba0/318_0_4108_2465/master/4108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e3c23a6949f79f92e31c3fd277bf1b9","title":"keep it clean the surprising 130 year history of handwashing","story":"Until the mid-1800s, doctors didn’t bother washing their hands – they would go from dissecting a cadaver to delivering a child. Then a Hungarian medic made an essential, much-resisted breakthroughIt felt strange when Boris Johnson emerged from the first Covid-19 Cobra meeting on 2 March and told us to wash our hands while singing Happy Birthday. The preppers among us had panic-shopped while awaiting his pronouncements, and others fretted about vulnerable loved ones, travel plans, the nightmare of simultaneous homeworking and home-schooling, and not being able to work at all. And all our leader had was this?As one of the few things we can do to significantly stop the spread of coronavirus while out in the infectious world, the new rules for this everyday habit have become the meme du jour. The Killers’ frontman, Brandon Flowers, tweeted a video of himself lathering up while crooning his hit Mr Brightside to 4 million followers. Judi Dench and Gyles Brandreth have posted themselves online reciting The Owl and the Pussycat with sudsy hands. A website for generating handwashing infographics to the song lyrics of your choice has gone viral.To Nancy Tomes, a distinguished professor of history at Stony Brook University, New York, seeing this basic advice headlining the public health agenda has felt even more strange. “Being a historian of this kind of pandemic event and then experiencing this one,” she says, “is kind of like being a passenger on the Titanic and watching it all unfold.” It also feels, she says, like going back to the early 20th century, when infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and smallpox were the No 1 cause of death, and the new science of germs had led to the first mass obsession with hand hygiene.Religious handwashing rituals have been around for thousands of years in Islamic, Jewish and other cultures, but the notion of disease spreading by hand has been part of the medical belief system for only about 130 years. However, the first recorded discovery of handwashing’s life-saving power came 50 years earlier, in 1848, as a huge, unwelcome shock.“If there had to be a father of handwashing it would be Ignaz Semmelweis,” says Miryam Wahrman, a professor of biology at William Paterson University in New Jersey and author of The Hand Book: Surviving in a Germ-Filled World. While working at Vienna General hospital, the Hungarian doctor was at the forefront of a more scientific approach to medicine. Faced with a doctor-led maternity ward in which maternal deaths from the dreaded childbed fever were significantly higher than in the midwife-run clinic there, he racked his brain for clues as to why.Germs were yet to be discovered, and it was still believed in the 1840s that disease was spread by miasma – bad smells in the air – emanating from rotting corpses, sewage or vegetation. Victorians kept their windows firmly shut against such malevolent forces. So it didn’t seem a problem that trainee doctors at Vienna General would hang out in the morgue dissecting corpses to figure out what had rendered them dead and then pop up to the maternity ward to deliver a baby without washing their hands.One of them then accidentally got cut by a scalpel during a dissection and died, seemingly of the same childbed fever the mothers had been getting. Semmelweis hypothesised that cadaverous particles from the morgue were to blame, and that such particles on the hands of doctors were making their way into women’s bodies during childbirth.Despite his success, his idea faced great resistance, and met a tragic end. He lost his job, and is thought to have had a breakdown. He died in a psychiatric institution, “a very despondent person at the untimely age of 47”, says Wahrman.Part of the problem, says Tomes, was that people, “didn’t have that conception of themselves as sort of walking petri dishes”. And doctors were offended by the suggestion that they could be causing infections. “The majority of doctors in Vienna at this time were from middle- or upper-class families, and they thought of themselves as very clean people compared with the working-class poor. He was insulting them when he said their hands could be dirty.”Over the next 40 years, an understanding of germs developed, and attitudes to hygiene gradually shifted. In 1857, while Semmelweis’s mental health declined, Louis Pasteur, of pasteurisation fame, raised awareness of pathogens, and how to kill them with heat. In 1876, the German scientist Robert Koch discovered the anthrax bacillus, kicking off the new research field of medical bacteriology. Cholera, tuberculosis, diphtheria and typhoid bacilli were subsequently identified.Surgeons started handwashing in earnest. Tomes says: “If you’re cutting open someone’s skin – that protective layer – you need to take extraordinary precautions.” The British surgeon Joseph Lister pioneered antiseptic surgery, which included handwashing, “and by the 1890s and into the early 1900s,” adds Tomes, “handwashing moved from being something doctors did to something everybody had been told to do”.Florence Nightingale helped. Despite still labouring under miasma theory, she intuitively improved hygiene in military hospitals during the Crimean war in the 1850s and, after returning to the UK, set about revolutionising nursing. “Nightingale influenced a new interest in household cleanliness as a goal that a good wife and mother needs to instil in her family,” says Tomes.The turn of the century saw the first popular public health campaigns being launched around tuberculosis, says Tomes. “Koch had shown that tuberculosis was not something you inherited from your grandmother, but that your grandmother coughed on you, and that’s why you got it.” The anti-tuberculosis movement was aimed at both adults and schoolchildren. “You really were getting little kids taught these rules about being clean and washing your hands.”Tomes adds: “People got totally phobic about shaking hands or kissing each other when they understood that their mouth, their skin and their hair had all these germs on them.” It’s one reason, she says, why young men started eschewing beards at the turn of the century. And why foods started being sold inidually wrapped, because of “this fear of germs and hands touching things”. But this hygiene-centric era was short-lived.The combination of public health messaging and the development of vaccines and antibiotics in the early 20th century saw death rates from bacterial diseases plummet. “The hyperattention to this kind of cleanliness became less important,” says Tomes. “A laxity crept in, I think, in healthcare and in everyday life after the second world war.”Sexually transmitted diseases started increasing again in the 1970s. “People started to realise, well, these things can come back if we get careless,” says Tomes. “But it was really with HIV coming in the 1980s – a novel, deadly, sneaky kind of virus – that everyone started to get hyper again about personal cleanliness.” Even though, of course, HIV is transmitted by blood, semen, vaginal fluids and breast milk, so hand hygiene isn’t a significant factor in prevention, Tomes says we have been operating with a more aware mindset in general since then. Hospital superbugs became a problem, “and now we have these novel viruses coming pretty regularly, but we’re also getting the re-emergence of bacterial diseases because of antibiotic resistance”.How effective is handwashing? Petra Klepac, an assistant professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, looked into this question in 2018 while predicting how a flu pandemic would spread in the UK, for the documentary Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic.“We were looking for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and pooling the results from these studies,” she says. One review, published in 2017, found significant effects from handwashing, compared with nonsignificant effects from face-mask use. When Klepac and colleagues drilled down into the highest quality data, gathered from a clinical setting, with clinical diagnosis and a control group (who didn’t increase hand hygiene) they discovered that if you washed your hands five to 10 times more than usual, “that would reduce your risk by a quarter”.At the start of a pandemic, this is pretty much all you’ve got. “You don’t have pharmaceutical interventions,” says Klepac. “You don’t have a vaccine. This is why we’re looking at nonpharmaceutical measures that are easily implemented.”To Wahrman, this knowledge feels empowering. “You can say to people: ‘Here’s one thing you can do to lower your risk.’ It’s simple. It’s right there and doesn’t cost anything. Wash your hands with soap before you touch your mouth, your nose or your eyes.

Other conspiracy theories contended the outbreak was caused by migrants or was a pure hoax.“Pro-Kremlin media outlets have been prominent in spreading disinformation about the coronavirus, with the aim to aggravate the public health crisis in western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national healthcare systems,” states the report, seen by the .The European commission’s chief spokesperson on foreign and security policy, Peter Stano, said there had been an increase in “disinformation, misleading information, outright lies and wrong things” since the start of the outbreak.The commission had noticed, he said, an increase in disinformation from Russia, providers based in the country and those with links to pro-Kremlin sources.One conspiracy theory aired on Kremlin-backed Sputnik radio in February drew a parallel between the 19th-century opium wars and coronavirus, implying that “England” and unnamed “international organisations” were seeking to control Chinese internal affairs, just as the British empire forced China to open its markets and cede territory at gunpoint.Meanwhile, the website Ria Fan claimed that a “false panic” about Covid-19 would benefit pharmaceutical companies looking to make “lucre” from the virus. And against a soundtrack of menacing music, Ren TV’s Military Secret documentary claimed the virus could be a “biological weapon” disseminated by US special forces in China.Researchers at Cardiff University’s centre for crime and security research, who carried out research with the commission, found an evolution in tactics by pro-Kremlin media.Rather than authoring disinformation, Russian sources were amplifying theories that had originated elsewhere, such as China, Iran or the US far right, the researchers said. “This tactic allows them to avoid the accusation of creating disinformation themselves, claiming instead that they are merely reporting what others are saying,” the report stated.Russia has strongly denied the accusations. “If there was even a single concrete example, I could comment on it, but once again they are just unfounded accusations,” said a spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.An internal EU network, where member states share cases, also reported examples of disinformation. In Lithuania there were false claims that a US soldier deployed to the country had been taken to hospital with coronavirus.Slovak authorities reported false information about the prime minister, Peter Pellegrini, who was said to have had the virus and infected EU leaders at a Brussels summit in February. (Pellegrini posted a picture of himself from a hospital bed on Facebook on 23 February, saying he had “an extensive infection”.)The report noted that the Kremlin-funded media company RT’s Spanish service was the 12th most popular source of information on coronavirus among social media users.EU officials also commented on media narratives in other countries. In China, the report said, state media sought to depict Xi Jinping as doing an admirable job, while portraying China’s political system as an asset in tackling the virus. In Iran, Covid-19 was described as a US bioweapon, as well as a disease weaponised by Israel to target Iran.The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded on the 7 April 1948, a date celebrated annually as World Health Day. As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIVAIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\u0026nbspWHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus.The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia’s minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country’s health system.The report concluded “the more pressing challenge” for public health was misinformation: stories that are inaccurate, often dangerously so, but not created with a political agenda.The report referred to claims that a “miracle mineral supplement” could wipe out coronavirus, a dangerous falsehood promoted by one prominent YouTuber. The US Food and Drug Administration warned last year that ingesting this substance, which contains chlorine dioxide, was equivalent to “drinking bleach”.The World Health Organization said last month the Covid-19 outbreak had been accompanied by an “infodemic”, an abundance of information, some accurate and some not. Facebook has since promised to give the WHO “as many free ads as they need” to turn the tide.The European commission is asking social media companies to promote its content more actively.The report concludes that social media companies have taken “strong measures” to combat false claims, but worries they are not doing enough to share information with independent observers. In particular, officials want to know how much time elapses between disinformation being posted and acted upon by social media companies.“Whoever is spreading the disinformation is essentially playing with people’s lives,” Stano said. “Every responsible social media or media user should be aware of this: that there is a lot of misinformation circulating around … Double check, triple check, go to a media you really trust and look at the sources.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08fd9ea1ad475532ead513bb1f2362b7e653934/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86912ff4209d77eee7423f1520156774","title":"thank you parisians dont bring the virus plea from rural france","story":"As Parisians flee to countryside, rural-dwellers accuse them of spreading infection and emptying shopsParisians who fled the French capital before the national lockdown are finding the welcome to second or family homes in the countryside less than warm after locals accused them of spreading the coronavirus.Trains leaving Paris for the countryside were packed on Tuesday morning, hours before the government’s order to stay at home unless absolutely necessary or face €135 fines came into effect at midday.In places, however, the Parisian arrivals were met with a frosty reception.Graffiti on a fence at Cap Ferret near Arcachon in south-west France set the tone with “Parigo home virus?”. Parigo is French slang for Parisians.The local Sud Ouest newspaper reported that a number of rural inhabitants were less than happy to see their Parisian compatriots.On the Facebook page of Lège-Cap-Ferret in the Gironde, the reaction was equally critical.“Already the Parisians and others with a second home have arrived … given that the supermarket has been stripped in two days,” wrote one local.Another wrote: “It’s very worrying to see all those people fleeing Paris – that will certainly spread the virus.”Ludovic Pons, a local politician, reported “feeling angry” on his Facebook page tweeting: “Thank you Parisians don’t bring us the virus.”When criticised for the post, he replied: “Some of them are walking on the beach and in the oyster-producing villages … It’s not a holiday, it’s quarantine for ALL.”In Brittany, Le Télégramme newspaper reported widespread local anger at urbanites descending on the region.A doctor from Auray, where one of the first coronavirus clusters was reported in France, was also concerned about the new arrivals.“It would be a pity if the influx of visitors aggravates the situation, which has been mostly well contained so far across in the area,” he said.On Belle-Île-en-Mer, one of the Breton islands where no cases of coronavirus have been reported so far among the 5,500 permanent residents, the atmosphere was reportedly tense.Fréderic Le Gars, president of the community committee, asked those with second homes to stay away.The mayor Thibault Grollemund, president of the hospital committee added: “There’s an obvious risk of saturation at our local hospital, that has no intensive care,” he said.One non-resident named only as Mathilde, who arrived just before the lockdown, told the paper: “It was already strained on the boat here and the welcome from locals has been icy.“They are blaming us for bringing the virus, emptying supermarket shelves and saying we risk taking up the rare number of hospital beds here. My neighbour gave me a ticking off from behind her hedge as I was unloading my suitcases.”She added: “As a result, we’re feeling guilty and keeping a low profile as well as applying as best we can the confinement measures.”Isabelle Ezanno, a doctor in Crac’h in the Morbihan, Brittany, described the Parisian exodus as “irresponsible”.“I wonder if people understand the gravity of the situation.”On Wednesday morning, the local police prefecture issued a decree limiting access to the Breton islands and banning non-residents from renting property on them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36618cd974dfa82bb542fd19b26c98a815d87003/679_734_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc9614d3421c6ff4e165f34aa27bda9","title":"st patricks day in pictures","story":"On the day after 54 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Ireland, deserted streets and shuttered pubs stripped of cheers, speeches and marching bands marked a St Patrick’s day like no other."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockGetty ImagesA group representing dentists has said almost one fifth of dental practices have scaled back services in some form amid warnings that the profession is “on the brink of collapse” due to the Covid-19 outbreak in the state.The Irish Dental Association (IDA) today released the findings of a survey of members which showed that 18 per cent of respondents have already closed practice in some form, while nearly half of respondents estimated income to their practices will fall at least 90 per cent due to the outbreak. Dentists say they are seeing widespread cancellations of appointments, while some practitioners are unhappy with the guidance given by the Department of Health on controlling the risks associated with Covid-19. The IDA said it is seeking a “wide-ranging package of supports” in order to survive. Fintan Hourihan, the organisation’s chief executive, said the vast majority of practitioners in Ireland “receive no support at all from the State, so are extremely exposed to this crisis. We have received notifications from dozens of practices saying they have already closed their doors, and our fear is that this number will multiply over the coming days”. He said the IDA “has made numerous efforts to communicate this message to politicians, and we have received no clear direction whatsoever. Politicians need to wake up to the fact that the dental profession as we know it is disintegrating before our eyes due to the fact that dentists simply cannot practice under these circumstances.”Members of the profession who spoke to The  highlighted a lack of personal protective equipment, which they say is especially needed due to the proximity between a dentist and a patient as well as aerosol equipment used during dentistry which may give rise to a higher risk.A letter to dentists from the Chief Dental Officer, dated Monday and seen by The , advises that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) “has advised that dental practices can remain open and there is currently no need for change in practice”. The letter advises that if a patient is showing symptoms of Covid-19, dental care should only be considered after consulting with their GP.A Q\u0026ampA document circulated along with the letter states that “currently the advice is that dental practices do not need to avoid certain procedures or close the practice”, and that “currently there is no advice to alter current dental professional practice.” It advises that aerosol devices can be used for asymptomatic patients. It goes on to state that there is no requirement for the use of face masks when using suction or aerosol for patients who are asymptomatic.Mr Hourihan said dentists are “frustrated with the advice given by the HPSC. They want to help all patients but particularly those in trouble and reluctantly feel compelled to alter their practice workings for the safeguarding of patients, their staff and their own health - in the majority of cases that means laying off staff.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Latest figures show there are now 292 confirmed cases of coronavirus in StateCoronavirus: Leaving Cert students feel anxious and uncertain over what lies aheadDentists say they are seeing widespread cancellations of appointmentsMourners stand outside church, following coronavirus guidelinesContingency plans for Junior and Leaving Certs being worked on, department saysRetailers introduce increased sanitation and reduce reliance on \u0026lsquohigh contact surfaces\u0026rsquoMigrants due to arrive on Wednesday from Dublin as part of emergency response to coronavirusSocial network says posts on coronavirus were incorrectly removed from platformT\u0026aacutenaiste issues cool response to proposals from Northern Secretary Brandon LewisPriority is to carry out between 10,000 and 15,000 Covid-19 tests per day by getting a network of acute hospitals to test locallyRobyn had high temperature, vomiting and floppy body when she was brought to hospitalHSE social distancing guidelines being applied on outdoor sites, say industry sourcesPlanning appeals board concerned Co Clare dunes would be adversely affected by worksWith increasing number of carers and older people going into self-isolation, industry is seeking emergency measures for sectorParacetamol is first medication of choice if you develop high temperature\u0026lsquoA lovely paramedic came, in full gear, to my house and swabbed my throat and my nose\u0026rsquoVolunteer group has ided Cork city into five electoral wardsIncrease in congregated groups out walking in national parks in recent daysStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4204988.1584444197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"share your covid 19 story have you lost your job or business","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA shopper wearing a face mask on Grafton Street, Dublin last weekend.

Photograph: PA Supermarkets across the State have started rolling out measures aimed at protecting customers and staff and ensuring there will continue to be sufficient supplies for all customers who need them.Amongst the most visible steps being taken are moves to ensure social distance is maintained and a reduced reliance on high contact surfaces. There has also been a significant increase in cleaning and disinfecting within stores. “We have been adopting additional measures over the past few days which have become more visible to customers such as social distance marking,” a Lidl spokeswoman said.As of Wednesday morning, Lidl has also deployed a company to spray store trolleys and baskets with a bio-misting spray.This specially designed cleaning device “is used to create a fine mist of disinfectant particles. As the particles settle onto and around surfaces the cleaning chemical starts to work killing bacteria, spores and viruses while sanitising the items immediately,” the spokeswoman said. The spray also kills airborne infections the spokeswoman said. Lidl said it is also likely to introduce other measures in the coming days and weeks “we will see additional measures put in place to offer even more reassurance to our teams and customers”. The spokeswoman said there had been a stepped up security presence in some stores in recent days but stressed that it was as a precaution and there have no reports of any incidents.SuperValu’s managing director Martin Kelleher said in order to “reflect the words of the Taoiseach we will come together as a nation by staying apart from each other and that’s just as important in SuperValu stores as it is anywhere else in the community.” He said that it was important for people “go about their shopping differently to make sure that everyone stays healthy.”Among the changes introduced as part of SuperValu’s social distancing and preventative measures will be notices as people enter stores reminding customers about social distancing. There will also be with hand sanitisers and staff to manage the number of people going in-store. “There are limitations on the number of customers allowed in store at any one time depending on the store size. We would ask people to bear with us and respect the directions given in-store,” Mr Kelleher said. He said once in-store, customers were being asked “to respect each other’s space and avoid contact with other customers by observing a social distance of two meters”. At checkouts customers may notice tape on the floor or signs showing them how far to stay apart from each other in the queue. They will be called to the till by the cashier and given additional advice. “For example, where possible we are asking people to use contactless or by mobile phone for larger amounts,” Mr Kelleher said. “Obviously we are aware that some customers may not be familiar with these payment methods and prefer to use cash, and we would ask them to have patience with us if asked to place cash on the checkout and step back, before the cashier then places their change back on the belt.”He reminded shoppers about measures already introduced for elderly and vulnerable people in the community. “We are prioritising the elderly all day long in our stores. We have more staff around our stores committed to ensuring the elderly and vulnerable customers are looked after when they visit,” he said.. He added that many SuperValu stores had “tailored solutions in place that best suit their customers whether it is dedicated staff to help these groups with their shopping in-store, dedicated times allocated to them, or the ability to phone in their order in advance and simply collect it”.He again stressed the need for the wider public “to buy only what they need to make sure that others do not have to go without.”A Tesco spokeswoman said that a two-metre cordon around the checkout areas had been introduced in line with HSE guidelines. “We’re encouraging customers to keep the required distance, by unloading their trolley or basket onto the empty conveyor belt and then proceeding to other side of the checkout to pack their bags and complete their transaction, using contactless where possible,” she said. She said Tesco was also encouraging customers “to be mindful of their own social distancing when moving around our stores”. We are communicating this to customers in store with signage and an audio reminder. She said cleaning had been increased “in particular shopping trolley handles, baskets, chip and pin terminals and self-scans in store”.

Image:  Google mapsA welcoming committee is being set up in Cahersiveen, Co. Kerry for a group of over 100 asylum seekers, arriving later today, Wednesday, despite concerns and strong criticism about lack of consultation.There are also fears that a key piece of tourism infrastructure will not be available this summer. The contract with the company which now runs the Skellig Star Hotel in the centre of Cahersiveen was singed on Monday, just two hours before local politicians were informed by the Department of Justice the hotel was to become a centre for asylum seekers currently living in Dublin hotels, as part of the emergency response to the coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, pandemic . The agreement is to provide accommodation for 150 people for 12 months. There has been heavy criticism of the lack of consultation. Cllr Johnny Healy-Rae ( Ind) has accused the Department of taking advantage of the virus to move people to Cahersiveen where medical and other services were already stretched. However his fellow councillor in the Kenmare area, Cllr Norma Moriarty (FF) said while there was a genuine sense of loss that a beautiful hotel was being taken out of operation, “it is never the wrong time to do the right thing.”“Our objective now is to make a success of this. In what are very restrictive times. There are positive offers of help and support including from the IFA, the farmers organisation,” Cllr Moriarty said. Family resource and other centres would become involved, she said. ConcernsPeople had concerns, and she understood this and she would like to see the hotel returned to a tourist facility in time.Of the 105 residents arriving this afternoon, there are 66 singles, mostly female, 16 female one parent one child families and one parent with two children and two couples, according to the profile given by the department.“The balance of the 150 residents will be transferred in the coming weeks,” the Department has said. School places would be arranged and residents in the new centre will have access to local health services similar to the local community in Cahersiveen, it said.Access to GP services will be through the medical card system.“If the concerns locally are that the people may have recently arrived from a region affected by Covid-19, I can confirm that no one in the group of 105 has been in this country for less than two months and all have been health screened by the HSE-led medical team at our reception centre in Baleseskin, North Dublin on their arrival,” the Department wrote to Cllr Michael Cahill.In a statement on Monday , the Department said they understood that the residents of Cahersiveen, and surrounding areas, will have questions and some concerns regarding the announcement.“This decision has not been taken lightly. We are in unprecedented times. The Department has a duty to protect all persons seeking international protection, and this is one step that we are taking in this regard,” it said.Safety To ensure the safety and wellbeing of applicants, they needed to transfer those who are currently in emergency accommodation in commercial hotels to dedicated accommodation centres to ensure that they can be supported by a centre management team and receive all HSE information and guidance in an appropriate and timely way, the statement said.The contract with the former Skellig Star hotel in Cahersiveen is for a 12 month period. It is to provide accommodation for 150 single people across 56 bedrooms and was offered to the Department under the Expressions of Interest process.The Skellig Star Hotel, formerly known as the Watermarque Hotel, underwent a €3 million revamp in 2017 when it was purchased by a group of Irish and Chinese Investors.The Department of Justice earlier this year denied that there were plans for a direct provision centre for the town of Cahersiveen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4205399.1584487008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord a parade in dublin you could only dream about","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dublin’s  O’Connell Street on St Patrick’s Day. Photograph: Tom Honan Is it just me or is it very hot in here? Might just take a little lie down. Perhaps it was unwise to discontinue self-isolating after visiting the White House last week. What with President Trump being in contact with more carriers than the back wheel of a push-bike. And the rest of us packed like sardines around the twin sofas in the Oval Office. “Will you take a wee drop of sanitiser in your hand?” No chance of hearing that in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Glad to be home.Oh Jesus, the heat. Might take that little lie down now...Still, it was worth going out to cover this year’s St Patrick’s Day Parade. Bashed out a colour piece for the paper and all. Remotely, of course.Conditions may have been blustery but the weather held up for the photos and that’s the main thing. There is nothing worse than when it rains on our national holiday. O’Connell Street was en fete, with drunken youths pouring merrily from buses well before the midday start. There was a festive atmosphere around town, the partying locals joined by over 200,000 half-cut overseas visitors dressed in leprechaun suits and shamrock festooned onsies.As the parade assembled near Parnell Square, the VIP stand opposite the GPO began to fill up with minor politicians and their offsprings’ offspring. Minister for the Arts Josepha Madigan arrived bang on time – an hour after a press release was issued alerting the media to her expected presence and many fine achievements in office. She was wearing an elegant woollen coat in a loud shade of Mary-Lou green. Eamon Ryan took his place on the viewing platform. As leader of the Green Party he is official ruler of Ireland for the day. He sported a necklace of wolverine teeth donated to the city in 2009 by actor Hugh Jackman. Unfortunately, Eamon refused to talk to any other leaders because they won’t form a national government with him. He self-isolated opposite Clery’s clock with his large entourage and their policy papers High spiritsNever mind. The crowd was in high spirits. They cheered and wept for joy when the lord mayor’s gilded coach arrived carrying the capital city’s first citizen Jim Gavin. Tom who? Tom Brabazon, Fianna Fáil? Oh right. He was the lad wearing the gold chain. Jim Gavin, the legend who led Dublin’s footballers to a record five-in-a-row All-Irelands was interviewed on the street by RTÉ’s Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh. You could see the Nationwide presenter was glad to be away from the poisonous atmosphere in the commentary box where unruly scenes unfolded earlier between all the sports commentators looking for a gig after their matches and race meetings were cancelled. They should have turned off the microphones. Some of the kiddies started crying when a torrent of ‘effin ’n blindin’ between parade regular Des Cahill and horse pundit Ted Walsh burst from the public address system. And then George Hamilton and Tony O’Donoghue started sobbing, and that set more of them off. Thankfully the arrival of Uachtarán na hÉireann and his wife enlivened proceedings even more. Michael D and Sabina were interviewed by Bláthnaid when Gavin finally stopped talking. The President said mystical things in Irish and English, and the Americans swooned and wished they could like him along with Donald Trump. Brass bands You could hear the brass bands beckoning from the Garden of Remembrance. The wonderful Dublin Fire Pipe Brigade band was already on the scene, this year with two very special mascots – Bród and Síoda, Ireland’s First Dogs. For some this was the highlight of the parade. At the barrier a mammy was telling her small daughter all about them. “But Ma, I thought them dogs was Áras an Uachtaráin dogs. Where’s Bernie’s Mountain?”“I don’t know, love. But that’s what they are: Bernie’s Mountain Dogs. She’s probably from Kerry.”The theme of this year’s festival parade was “Spring Fever”.It was a big day for the grand marshall, who eschewed the usual mode of conveyance – a flash car. He may not be a minister when the next government is formed, so it was good practice. Instead Simon Harris arrived at the reviewing stand on a hospital trolley, pushed by exhausted nurses and doctors. He then walked the 2.5km route wearing a green velvet Uncle Sam-style tailcoat, knee breeches, brogues and a green top hat with a Tricolour band.Instead of a silver-topped cane Uncle Si carried a giant cotton swab, cutting quite the dash.The broad silk sash across his chest was embroidered in gold with the words “Your Country Needs You!”An appreciative local crowd applauded because even though he is the Minister for Health in a Government just given the bum’s rush in a general election, he is playing a blinder as front-of-house manager in this current crisis. Magnificent floatsIt took nearly two hours for the magnificent floats to pass the halfway point in a riot of colour and clamour. Weird and wonderful creations filled the streets, though everyone missed the great Paddy Drac, who died last year. The FAI float was a shambles, covered in cheap green and white crepe paper and mouldy scraps of decent-skin blazers. Eamon Dunphy sat at the back, throwing pens into the crowd. For years the FAI float featured a giant inflatable “Delaney Baby” but it burst. It cost a fortune but delivered nothing. It was followed by the “DemaboveinDublin” float sponsored by Michael Healy-Rae’s Black Cap Company Ltd (trading as his Mace Shop in Kilgarvan). It featured members of the Rural Independents Group dancing on a giant inflatable Shane Ross. There was confusion over the meaning of one pageant called “Stifle Sighs” with its giant inflatable gammon, dancing horses’ heads, theatrically expiring grannies and tipsy children dressed as the Cotswolds. The theatre company, from Cheltenham, explained the title is an anagram of “Selfish Gits”. The Brexit float had to be seen to be believed. Apparently it had a giant inflatable Baby Boris. But nobody saw it. Among all the talented groups from home and abroad, the Formation Talk Dancers from Kildare Street really caught the eye. They pirouetted around giant inflatable “self-oscillating taoisigh”, with full permission from the HSE.The crowd was enchanted. One man became emotional when a giant inflatable toilet roll surrounded by dancing Prof McConkeys sashayed past his spot outside Supermacs. He told us his name. “Joe. Joe Deviris. ” He was loving the parade. “As I told your researcher, in regards of Prof McConkey….” A colleague from the Examiner smirked and waved his notebook at us. The McDonald Majorettes kept trying to overtake the groups in front of them, twirling their Big Mandate Batons. “We should be up the front,” said a chap dressed as a house, muscling past. He said his name was Eoin. “Too right,” said a chap dressed as a fiscal space, pushing on through. He said his name was Pearse. “If the batons don’t work we’ll be blowing our trumpets outside Government Buildings to get back into the limelight,” said Mary Lou, chief twirler. Soothing wordsA very fancy schmancy float purred past, dripping soothing words, a giant inflated John Concannon held down by ropes smiling above it. He’s the Government’s favourite Sultan of Spin. Back again. Meanwhile, the Taoiseach said a few words from the reviewing stand before he left, standing at a safe distance from the hacks because he is self-oscillating and it feels good. “Ireland is open for business,” declared Leo Varadkar, reading from an old St Patrick’s Day script.

Photograph: Stephanie LecocqEPABrexit talks scheduled this week between European Union and United Kingdom negotiators will not go ahead to to the Covid-19 pandemic, a UK government spokesman said on Tuesday.“In light of the latest guidance on coronavirus, we will not formally be convening negotiating work strands tomorrow in the same way we did in the previous round,” the spokesman said.Both sides are examining the possibility of negotiating via video-conferencing or conference calls “in the coming weeks”, the spokesman added.Britain has until July to request an extension to its current transition period, under which it is continuing to observe pre-Brexit norms pending the agreement of a deal for future trade.If the two sides fail to reach an agreement by the end of the year, the UK will automatically begin trading with the EU on World Trade Organization terms from January 1st, 2021, a shift that is forecast to damage the Irish economy, particularly exports. Britain left the EU in January.The two sides had been scheduled to hold rotating rounds of talks between London and Brussels until May. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the European Commissions said the possibility of extending the transition period was a question for the UK, and that remote alternatives to the talks like video-conferencing were being explored.‘Very dynamic environment’“We definitely will do our best to ensure we have the capacity to do so,” the spokesman said. “Obviously we are in a very dynamic environment.”Meanwhile, EU leaders are set to hold their second summit in two weeks in a fresh attempt to forge a joint response to the coronavirus pandemic as Europe takes over from China as the frontline in the fight against the disease. They will meet in a virtual online video-conference from their offices in the bloc’s 27 capitals.The virus case count in Europe has climbed to more than 50,000 and more than 2,000 people have died of it in the region. The inexorable spread of the disease has hit markets and sown public fear, but nervous governments have introduced quick-fix measures – partial border closures or quarantine – with little consultation.After Italy, ground zero in Europe’s battle with Covid-19, Spain and now France have imposed lockdowns, confining citizens to their homes except for urgent business such as buying food or heading to any hospital that might still have the capacity to treat them.ID checksSeven countries have informed the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, that they have reintroduced ID checks inside Europe’s passport-free Schengen Area. Among them are Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, which all took unilateral action to halt the influx of migrants in 2015.Indeed, it is a similar challenge that leaders are grappling with as they confront the coronavirus – how to ensure that the fraying solidarity among partners in the same European club does not completely unravel as the crisis deepens.Asked on Monday whether Europe can ever return to real ID-check free travel after this, German chancellor Angela Merkel said: “I hope so. But it’s been shown that co-ordination didn’t work well everywhere the way one would have hoped.”The main problem confronting the leaders is to halt the arrival of more virus cases, co-ordinate any border closures and guarantee that vital medical equipment and food can reach those in need.They are expected to endorse a 30-day travel ban on people wanting to come to Europe for tourism or non-essential business. Long-term EU residents, diplomats and members of European families would be exempt. Health care and transport workers could escape the ban too.Separately, so-called “green lanes” would be set up at the internal borders of the Schengen countries, allowing fast-track access for trucks ferrying essential supplies to defy the traffic jams that have begun forming at some crossing points.Single marketThe aim, according to European Council president Charles Michel, who will chair the summit, is “to reduce unnecessary movement but at the same time to ensure the movement of merchandise, of goods, so that we can guarantee as much as possible the integrity of the single market, guarantee the deliveries that are needed”.The proposals are relatively modest, but Europe’s powers in this crisis are limited. While it may be a union, the world’s biggest trading bloc remains an accumulation of 27 inidual countries, some with populist and far-right governments that reject orders from Brussels.“In recent days, European countries failed to co-ordinate their approach,” Czech prime minister Andrej Babis said on Saturday as he announced the closure of retail businesses in his country. “We didn’t need to wait for Brussels to give us any advice.” – additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4205655.1584512783!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden cements lead with further wins in us primaries","story":"Former US vice-president Joe Biden has further cemented his lead in the Democratic presidential nominee race with three more primary wins. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe Biden delivers remarks at his primary night election event in Columbia, South Carolina on February 29th. Photograph:  Getty ImagesPresidential candidate Joe Biden swept to victory in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday night, cementing his path to the Democratic nomination as the party chooses its candidate to take on Donald Trump in November’s presidential election.Mr Biden won the Florida primary by a huge margin, scooping up the majority of the 219 delegates at stake in the state.He was also projected to win in the rust-best state of Illinois as well as further west in Arizona.Exit polls suggested that the former vice president won a high percentage of the African-American vote in Florida, as expected. But he also polled extremely well with white blue collar workers who bolstered his rival Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election.Three states — Florida, Arizona and Illinois — held their primary contests as planned yesterday, despite the threat of coronavirus. But Ohio postponed its primary until June, generating tensions between the state’s governor and the courts over the decision. As well as the two front-runners, Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard was also on the ballot in the three states.DelayedSeveral primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, including in Louisiana and Georgia, have all delayed their selection processes by several weeks. The party’s nominee will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in July in Wisconsin, though the deepening coronavirus crisis has thrown the trajectory of the primary cycle into question.Mr Biden’s strong performance on Tuesday follows his victory in five of the six states that voted a week ago, as well as the vast majority of states on Super Tuesday on March 3rd.He has now established what appears to be an insurmountable lead over his main rival, Bernie Sanders, who failed to capitalise on his wins in the early voting states in February, particularly after a swathe of former presidential candidates endorsed Mr Biden. While Mr Sanders lost all three states to Hillary Clinton in 2016, his margin of defeat against Biden was greater on Tuesday.As votes continued to be counted, the former vice president had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to Mr Sanders’s 839 last night. The nominee needs to reach a threshold of 1,991 to become the party’s candidate.Addressing supporters last night from Wilmington, Delaware, via a livestream feed and wearing a green tie to mark St Patrick’s Day, much of Mr Biden’s speech focused on coronavirus.“Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency, akin to fighting a war,” he said. “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead.”“The coronavirus does not care if you are a Democrat or a Republican,” he said, it will “touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable in society. We’re all in this together”.He also attempted to reach out to younger voters who have tended to back Mr Sanders in the Democratic primaries so far. “I hear you, I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and unify this nation.”PandemicDespite the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, which has started to impact daily life in America, turnout in Florida appeared to be higher than in 2016, though this may have reflected the large number of postal and early voting. The total number of people who voted in Illinois was much lower than in 2016, reflecting the fact that fewer voters voted early.The latest primaries come less than four months before the Democratic National Convention in July.In the last debate before Tuesday’s primary contests, both Mr Biden and Mr Sanders said they would support the other, whoever becomes the party’s candidate.Mr Biden also pledged to choose a woman as his running-mate if he is selected as the party’s nominee, and reiterated his pledge to appoint the first black woman to the Supreme Court, saying it was “long overdue”.Mr Biden’s public commitment prompted immediate speculation as to who his choice would be. Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar – who both ran for the party’s nomination but have since endorsed Mr Biden – and Georgia’s former governor Stacey Abrams were among the names that have been mentioned. Michigan’s governor Gretchen Whitmer, a high-profile endorser of Mr Biden, whose support may have helped him to his decisive victory in the state’s primary last Tuesday ruled herself out in an interview with MSNBC. “It’s not going to be me,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Schools in England to close Friday as UK death toll reaches 104Politics latest news: PM announces schools to shut as death toll hits 104Comment: Donald Trump is right - we cannot allow China to obscure its integral role in the coronavirusJohnny Depp told doctor he chopped off his own fingerSpeeding businessman spared  lengthy driving ban for the sake of his son\u0026#39s football careerGovernment considers universal basic income to help workers through coronavirus crisisWith most sport off the table due to coronavirus, fans turn to chess Supermarkets planning coordinated closures and staff swaps to keep supplies flowingDaughter of Uzbekistan\u0026#39s late dictator jailed for 13 yearsFunerals to ban over 70s, only allow immediate family and be planned over Skype, Church of England announcesCoronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK - and how does it compare to other countries? Polish theatre legend comes out as gay at 100Where in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?What is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Coronavirus cure hope as 79-year-old Italian man successfully treated with experimental drugWoodland that hid Charles II to be replantedWhere in London have coronavirus cases been detected?What the Government\u0026#39s new coronavirus advice means for how we live nowLocally transmitted coronavirus cases in China down to one for second straight dayComment: The virus threatens to change everything... and it’s already changed the Commons\tWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/17/TELEMMGLPICT000227951577_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8juO8C_Vdx2cT20LARTibjWU-KwRaHvlaJXY1texVLQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"not age matters healthy","story":"\u0026#39Policies that increase social exclusion of the elderly must be avoided at all costs\u0026#39Coronavirus Article Bar with counter ..On Sunday morning I woke up with a jolt. The plan had shifted to cocoon over-70s in their homes for four months. At the same time, special powers would be introduced to allow the arrest of those who broke the quarantine rules. I imagined police cars chasing little old ladies with their shopping trolleys down the high street and helicopters zooming in on me walking my dog. Had the world gone crazy?I declare a conflict here – I am 71. I also work full-time and am reasonably fit. The thought of being locked up fills me with absolute horror. Until now our Government’s response on coronavirus has been laudable and I’ve been very supportive. Not the hysteria we’ve seen in the US and some other countries but measured, scientifically based and sensible. This new bombshell was simply not thought through at all.The rationale is straightforward. The death rate from Covid-19 is higher in infected older people. That’s clear from China, Korea and Italy. On their way to heaven they use up NHS resources: ventilators, ITU beds and nursing time, all in short supply. Locking people up for their own protection seems a logical policy to save resources. But it’s not age that really matters – it’s the state of health prior to infection. Many 50-year-olds are burdened with serious comorbidities – diabetes, chronic lung disease, heart failure. Lifestyle issues – obesity, lack of exercise, smoking and alcohol abuse also threaten longevity.I’ve been a consultant oncologist in the NHS for 40 years. When I started, we had all sorts of age cut-offs, rigidly implemented. Renal dialysis stopped at 50, bone marrow transplants at 55, and even admission to coronary care units at 65. Patients over that age who had a heart attack were carted off to a very depressing Victorian geriatric hospital – fortunately now closed. There were no monitors, drugs or devices to normalise abnormal heart rhythms, and certainly no crash trolleys. Gradually, we came to realise it was not the absolute biological age that mattered but health and lifestyle status. The ageist policies were all discarded 20 years ago.This pandemic is no different. There are many factors that make an inidual more prone to serious illness with this virus. We need to select iniduals who should protect themselves as best as possible based on their general health, not age.Most healthy septuagenarians are fine to stay in society. And sequestering people will have profound psychological problems for many. My wife runs a lunch club once a month for 40 people at a local restaurant. At Christmas I provide wine and they get a little tipsy. It’s great to see them enjoying themselves. But today’s lunch is cancelled, leaving a new void in their already empty lives. OK, social gatherings are probably not on, but shutting older people away is not the answer. One minister suggested that taking the dog for a walk would be fine. If anyone wants to borrow my dog he’s always available. What kind of policymaking is this?There will be deaths and that is sad. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) predicted in January that there will be 620,000 deaths in the UK this year. The worst-case scenario for coronavirus-related deaths is 250,000. But this is double-counting – the majority of virus deaths are already in the ONS total. Many will die whether infected or not. But loneliness is a killer, too. Statistics clearly show the mortality rate is higher after the death of a partner. The psychological morbidity of isolation is profound. Lack of communication, boredom and social isolation can lead to deep depression, making people question the value of their lives. Such existential thoughts can lead to serious physiological problems, compounded by claustrophobia and suicidal ideation. There is only so much daytime TV and so many boxsets the mind can take without going mad.Fortunately, it seems that my isolation is no longer compulsory. I will change my work pattern a bit. I’ve planned Skype consultations instead of a clinic tomorrow. Life will change but it will go on. But policies that increase social exclusion of the elderly must be avoided at all costs.Coronavirus latest news: Schools in England to close Friday as UK death toll reaches 104Politics latest news: PM announces schools to shut as death toll hits 104Comment: Donald Trump is right - we cannot allow China to obscure its integral role in the coronavirusJohnny Depp told doctor he chopped off his own fingerSpeeding businessman spared  lengthy driving ban for the sake of his son\u0026#39s football careerGovernment considers universal basic income to help workers through coronavirus crisisWith most sport off the table due to coronavirus, fans turn to chess Supermarkets planning coordinated closures and staff swaps to keep supplies flowingDaughter of Uzbekistan\u0026#39s late dictator jailed for 13 yearsFunerals to ban over 70s, only allow immediate family and be planned over Skype, Church of England announcesCoronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK - and how does it compare to other countries? Polish theatre legend comes out as gay at 100Where in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?What is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Coronavirus cure hope as 79-year-old Italian man successfully treated with experimental drugWoodland that hid Charles II to be replantedWhere in London have coronavirus cases been detected?What the Government\u0026#39s new coronavirus advice means for how we live nowLocally transmitted coronavirus cases in China down to one for second straight dayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"continents response coronavirus proves european solidarity has","story":"Coronavirus Article Bar with counter ..True to form, the European Union’s unconvincing response to the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated that, when it comes to dealing with a crisis of truly global proportions, Brussels is little more than a liability, especially when it comes to protecting the interests of its member states.As the first country to feel the full force of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, Italy had every right to expect its EU partners to do everything in their power to ease the crisis. It was to this end that Rome made the relatively modest request for other member states to provide it with vital medical supplies, from face masks to breathing equipment. But instead of coming to Italy’s aid, the response from other EU countries was to do nothing, leaving it to China to provide the much-needed equipment.Moreover, far from inspiring a desperately-needed show of EU solidarity, the coronavirus has resulted in the vast majority of EU states seeking to protect their own interests, with Germany at one point even refusing to allow the export of face masks to Italy.Consequently, while the EU has prevaricated over how best to respond to the crisis, Europe has been brought to a virtual standstill as a succession of member states have implemented their own unilateral measures, such as closing their borders, as they seek to protect their citizens from suffering a similar fate to those of Italy.By the time European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Monday that the EU was imposing its own 30-day ban on travel to the European Union and Schengen zone, it was already a fait accompli so far as most of Europe was concerned. The vast majority of EU states had already closed their borders, rather than waiting for the cumbersome Brussels bureaucracy to ride to their rescue.It might even be argued that the EU’s tardy response is one of the reasons why Europe, not Asia, has now become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.Spread of coronavirus in EuropeAnother lamentable consequence of the EU’s inability to provide effective leadership in a crisis is that it has led to member states indulging in blatant breaches of some of the EU’s guiding principles. The decision by France and Germany, for instance, to restrict the export of medical supplies to their European neighbours is a clear violation of the European single market, while the ban imposed by Austria and the Czech Republic on all travellers from Italy breaches the principle of free movement.The EU’s inability to devise an effective response to the coronavirus outbreak is not the first time Brussels has been found wanting in terms of safeguarding the interests of its members.The bailout package the EU forced on Greece in 2010 during the eurozone crisis has consigned the country to decades of austerity, an arrangement that Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, recently likened to the country being placed in a debtors’ prison.It has been a similar story with the migrant crisis in southern Europe, where the EU struggled to find an effective response to the estimated 1.7 million refugees seeking shelter and refuge. About the only meaningful contribution from Brussels was to offer the Turks a six billion euro bribe to prevent the migrants from leaving Turkey. As for those that managed to make the treacherous Mediterranean crossing, they have been abandoned in makeshift camps on Greek islands such as Lesbos, where their presence, together with the legions of aid workers looking after them, has exacerbated tensions with the local inhabitants to the extent that the migrant camps are being subjected to regular attacks by vigilante groups.The EU’s sclerotic response to the coronavirus threat, together with its failure to tackle challenges ranging from Greece’ bailout to the migrant crisis, certainly raises some awkward questions about the EU’s viability in its current form.Following Brexit, the instinct of committed Europhiles such as President Emmanuel Macron of France has been to call for even closer political and economic union, with the ultimate aim of creating a European superstate.Yet the prospects of this happening appear remote indeed if, when confronted with an existential challenge like coronavirus, the default position of EU member states is to jealously protect their interests at the expense of their European neighbours, destroying key pillars of the European project, such as the free movement of people and unrestricted trade, in the process.Such behaviour not only exposes the concept of European solidarity as a complete sham it suggests that the EU will struggle to present a united front when it comes to dealing with future challenges, such its post-Brexit trading relationship with the UK.To date, EU negotiators have assumed they can play hardball with Britain because they rely on the backing of the other 27 member states. But this pretence of unity can no longer be taken for granted after the deep isions the coronavirus crisis has exposed in the EU’s ranks.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

high-risk areas for transmission of coronavirus. It is expected that, in the wake of the Government\u0027s recommendation, public venues will close voluntarily – but an emergency bill could take matters out of owners\u0027 hands.As it stands, it is not illegal for venues to open, but Mr Johnson said the Government had the power to enforce closures if necessary.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has placed an emphasis on limiting smaller gatherings in order to counter the spread of the virus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you

for coronavirus which could give a result in just 30 minutes for people at home, has been developed by Oxford University.The super sensitive test, which can picks up the virus in its very early stages when it might otherwise have been missed, could be rolled out to testing centres within a fortnight and could soon be available for home use.Previous viral RNA tests took 1.5 to 2 hours to give a result slowing down the ability to respond quickly to the crisis. The technology has been validated with clinical samples at Shenzhen Luohou People’s Hospital in China and has a 100 per cent success rate at picking up both positive and negative results.Prof Zhanfeng Cui, the Director of the Oxford Suzhou Centre for Advanced Research (OSCAR) said it would initially be used at medical centres but the team hoped people would eventually be allowed to test themselves at home.“This is one of our targeted uses,” he told The . “The techniques can be self operated with minimium training.  One area we are not sure is the regulatory requirement.   “If the normal rule of home testing is followed,  the regulatory approval may take up to 6 months.  We are making inquires for this.”The test has taken just seven weeks to develop after Chinese scientists released the genetic structure of the virus in January. Currently virus testing either looks for the genetic code of the disease, or hunts for antibodies produced by the the immune system after it starts to react,  usually a couple of days after infection.   Viral RNA tests can detect the disease earlier than antibody tests and the new test has higher sensitivity than current diagnostics, and has a lower detection limit, so could detect the disease earlier.The results can be read by the naked eye rather than needing a computer or machine making it potentially useful in rural areas, airports community healthcare centres and at home.Prof Wei Huang, of Oxford, added: “The beauty of this new test lies in the design of the viral detection that can specifically recognise SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) RNA and RNA fragments.  “The test has built-in checks to prevent false positives or negatives and the results have been highly accurate.”More from

have duty remain open even teaching becomes impossible","story":"Exams should be postponed, and schools could end up being more like centres for pastoral careeMy 96 year-old mother-in-law survived the Blitz. She’d heard on Radio 4 someone her age saying how the current atmosphere reminded her of 1940. Yes, she said, but it is different now. Back then you knew the enemy, who was dropping bombs on you. It’s not Hitler who’s going to kill me now. It’s my friends, my neighbours, even my family. What this wise old lady spotted was that the coronavirus is an entirely new challenge to our familiar world. To solve the problems it creates in our society requires completely new answers, not least of all in education and schools. The official Government line is, at thae moment, that schools should stay open for as long as possible. Closing them would take off the streets hundreds of thousands of adults that an already depleted NHS will need to care for the sick, and a further army of people needed to run other essential services.Yet the cracks are already appearing in this policy. Wales and Scotland have already moved to close their schools. The independent sector has led the way in closing schools. Of course independent schools have the best interests of their children at heart, but their parents are more likely to be able to afford childcare and more likely to sue if things go wrong.What is ominous for the Government is the extent to which parents are voting with their feet and taking their children out of school. One leading school, which does not wish to be named, says that attendance, normally 98 per cent, has dropped to 65 per cent. These schools are closing themselves, presenting the management with a fait accompli. Unless the Government comes up with new ideas they are likely to find that the 93 per cent of children in maintained schools will follow the pattern of their peers in the independent sector.The worries expressed by the education sector are honourable and valid. Public examinations present insurmountable problems in their current form. Teacher absences threaten the delivery of anything like a conventional education. If schools cannot perform the duties they were founded to do, what is the point of them staying open, like wounded soldiers on the battlefield of a battle they can no longer fight? And what about large numbers of young children gathered together in one place, when even going to the pub or to a restaurant is frowned on?Yet we have to keep our schools open for as long as possible, throw away the rule book and create a new solution for a new problem. We have to postpone public examinations. This will cause immense administrative and emotional problems. But they will be easier to deal with than the problems caused to young people by entering them for life-changing exams for which teacher absence and general turmoil mean they cannot be properly prepared, and from which a number will be excluded by illness – not to mention that no school can arrange for its exam candidates to sit six feet apart.More importantly, for a short school period of time, we need to redefine radically the nature and purpose of a school, from somewhere the child goes to learn to a giant child-minding centre for those who otherwise would not be able to access childcare.Part of the rationale for this is the relatively mild effect the virus seems to have on children, and recognition that if we are to preserve the weak we must rely on the strength of the strong. Pastoral care, rather than teaching and learning, would be the highest priority in this redefined school. Our children may not be high risk for the virus itself, but the risk of infection for the adults they love means they face a threat of a different kind.Of course there are huge problems – but if Dominic Cummings is really serious about change this is a challenge he and his new breed of civil servants should relish. Not all those who supervise children in school will be teachers, and those who do will need a new, fast-track CRB check. Some schools will need to expand into adjacent buildings to maximise the space between children – but offices are closing everywhere. Massive work needs to be put into distance learning and the use of digital resources. Rigorous testing would need to be in place so that if a school became a centre for infection it could be closed rapidly.The London Underground was never designed to be an air-raid shelter. Using it for that purpose in the Blitz is no more radical than using our schools as pastoral care facilities in a time of crisis. Martin Stephen is a former High Master of St Paul’s SchoolThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It needs to do the same on Brexit.”But Mr Raab – even as he announced advice against any foreign travel “with immediate effect” – insisted the negotiations could still succeed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And he announced a three-month mortgage holiday for homeowners in difficulties because of the outbreak.But economic thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that the chancellor – in the job for only one month – “will need to come back with more”, as firms could otherwise\u0026nbspbecome financially unviable when the loans come up for repayment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe massive cash injection – on top of a £30bn economic stimulus in last week’s budget – came as the government released emergency legislation allowing police to detain iniduals thought to be infected with the\u0026nbspvirus and enabling the government to shut down ports and airports and seize vehicles.Earlier, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance warned that as many as 55,000 people in the UK\u0026nbspmay now be infected and said it would be a “good outcome” if the\u0026nbspeventual death toll could be kept below 20,000.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemStanding alongside Mr Johnson in the second daily coronavirus press conference at No 10, Mr Sunak said: “This is not a time for ideology\u0026nbspand orthodoxy. This is the time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen –\u0026nbspthis government will give you all the tools you need to get through this.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“We will support jobs. We will support incomes, we will support businesses, and we will help you protect your loved ones. We will do whatever it takes.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspSunak also said mortgage lenders had agreed a\u0026nbspscheme so that “people will not have to pay a penny towards their mortgage costs before they get back on their feet”.He promised to work with trade unions and business groups over the coming days to urgently develop new forms of employment support to help protect people’s jobs and their incomes.Mr Johnson acknowledged that the government’s call for Britons to stay home and avoid contact with other people was “unprecedented since World War Two”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailAnd he tried to present himself as the leader of a nation at war, saying: “We must act like any wartime government, and do whatever It takes to support our economy.“Yes, this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable.“And we know how to beat it and we know that if as a country we follow the scientific advice that is now being given, we know that we will beat it.“However tough the months ahead, we have the resolve and the resources to win the fight.“And to repeat, this government will do whatever it takes.”The repeated use of the phrase “whatever it takes” seemed a deliberate echo of former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, intended to reassure panicking markets in the same way his 2012 promise to protect the euro did during the eurozone crisis.The PM appeared to hint that he may give in to pressure to order schools to close, saying the position was “under continuous review”.Asked what he would do about pupils on free meals if schools were closed, the PM said: “As we come to the decision on schools, we will have plans ready to go on that. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has a plan to make sure that parents with kids who are eligible for free schools meals get the compensation or the treatment they need one way or the other. We have certainly anticipated that.”Mr Sunak said that the guaranteed loans equated to 15 per cent of UK GDP.\u0026nbsp“That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers, or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms,” the chancellor said. “And if demand is greater than the initial £330bn I’m making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required.“I said whatever it takes, and I meant it.”The support will be delivered through a new Bank of England lending facility and an extension to the business interruption scheme announced in the budget, which will now provide loans of up to £5m rather than £1.2m, interest-free for six months.He announced cash grants of up to £25,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses with a rateable value below £51,000, to help them through a period when customers have been advised not to attend pubs and clubs.A year-long business rates holiday will be extended to all companies in these sectors, said the chancellor.And he assured businesses that the government’s action will allow them to make claims against insurance policies covering pandemic losses.Cash grants of £3,000 for the smallest businesses, announced in the budget, are to be increased to £10,000.Mr Sunak said he was discussing with transport secretary Grant Shapps a potential support package specifically for airlines and airports, which are suffering from a collapse in passenger numbers.IFS director Paul Johnson said that, while “substantial”, the cash support for businesses announced by the chancellor “is probably not well targeted at saving jobs”, as it will remain expensive for\u0026nbspretail, leisure and hospitality businesses to keep staff on.A package to support employment might include cuts to employer national insurance contributions, a delay in increases to the national living wage\u0026nbspand increased support for iniduals through universal credit, as well as help for workers to move temporarily to jobs now in high demand, like delivery drivers and warehouse workers, he suggested.British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said: “Businesses will welcome the scale of the government’s latest response, as well as the specific support it is offering to some of the worst-affected parts of our economy. These measures could be a lifeline for many businesses across the UK who are now experiencing wholesale disruption as a result of the pandemic.”But he warned: “Further measures will be needed to help all firms and their employees meet this unprecedented challenge.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “The government has announced a mortgage holiday for homeowners but it must suspend rents too. Millions of people rent in the UK. Suspend rents. Ban evictions. Now.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The chancellor is right to provide emergency support for business. But this can’t be just a bailout for boardrooms. It has to put money in workers’ pockets too.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These materials are provided in English and nine additional languages from affected areas, and are available at all international airports, ports and international train stations.“We are testing established arrangements already in place for caring for unwell people arriving at airports to make sure the system is ready locally. We are also providing guidance and briefing to staff, so they know what to expect and how best to respond.”Public Health Englands medical director, Prof Yvonne Doyle, said that washing hands with soap and water is more effective than wearing a face mask, although face masks are important for staff to use in hospitals when dealing with suspected cases.On March , Boris Johnson revealed the governments battle plan to tackle the spread of Covid-.During a press conference at No, the British Prime Minister said: The army is of course always ready as and when, but that is under the worst case scenario.Contingency plans are in place for anything from a mild pandemic through to a severe prolonged pandemic as experienced in  known as Spanish Flu.Police could also be told to switch their focus to only tackle serious crime  emergency services start to buckle under pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus saving lives saving business","story":"The warning from British Airways, that the giant airline is fighting for its very survival, is chilling.

But this could change in the coming days.Following the advice of experts, the UK has said it will be adopting a staged response which includes daily briefings to the public.Ministers have said it is important to get the timing right for stricter measures.London may be facing a coronavirus lockdown soon.Sources close to City Hall say the Government is preparing fresh laws to allow this.Measures include stopping Londoners leaving their homes except to go to the supermarket or pharmacy, The Sun was told.Downing Street said ministers could even use existing laws to keep people in isolation for their own safety.Lockdown could come as soon as Friday, though sources stressed the plans were not imminent.London is the worst affected area in the country - with  cases and  deathsA UK lockdown does look to be inevitable in the near future, as the number of cases and deaths increase.It could mean elderly people being forced by law to stay inside and for people who are under  to travel to only travel to workit cannot be closed “Lockdown” actually isnt a technical term used by public health officials, it is often referred to as “mass quarantines, where residents are forced or advised to stay at home.Although the UK seems to be moving slower than other countries in its response to Covid-, preventative measures have been put in place, with action plans ready to enforcethe situation gets worse.With a major epidemic in the UK expected, the government is exploring ways to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the amount of people affected when the pandemic hits its peak.Englands education secretary will be meeting headteachers to discuss the next step for schools and the government have confirmed ver s will be told to stay home in the coming weeks.Last week, Nicola Sturgeon revealed after a cobra meeting, attended by Boris Johnson, that the UK had moved from the delay to the contain phase as the situation remains to be closely monitored.The government has said that during the delay phase:These steps are being implemented to hopefully, signicantly reduce the number of infections and deaths by up to a third.If the number of cases increase, new measures such as forcing people to stay in quarantine and troops being deployed to support emergency services could be introduced.In addition to this, the UK, along with Japan, the eurozone, Canada, and Switzerland have joined forces with the US Central Bank to prevent coronavirus causing a global recession.Interest rates have been cut to zero and a bn stimulus programme has been launched. The list of countries on lockdown is rapidly growing as the virus continues to spread at an alarming rate.The majority of the countries in lockdown are in Europe, which is the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.This is as apart from China, alarmingly, Europe has more reported cases and deaths of Covid-, than the rest of the world combined.The full list of all countries on lockdown are as follows Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If this was going to be around for a month, everyone could take on a couple of extra shts.But this looks like it will be around a good few months and its very dficult to sustain that over a period of time, as it becomes unsafe for people to work.We have regulated hours because the longer youre working, the more tired you become and the more likely to make mistakes.What the NHS has always been good at is pulling together in a crisis. We are going to have to roll up our sleeves for the next couple of months until this settles, and morale is good at the moment.Butthis carries on for a long time, fatigue and stress will set in.If over the next six months, one in five people have it we can deal with it. Butfour in five people catch it, the NHS simply cant cope.Dr Rinesh Parmar, , is a speciality registrar in anaesthetics and intensive care in the West Midlands.Dr Parmar says: “It’s feeling really under pressure at the moment and there are frantic plans being made to try and prepare us.Were testing patients every day, but it takes over  hours for us to get a result.We have to assume anyone with breathing symptoms is positive and treat them as such - that’s increasing the workload dramatically. My colleagues are really stretched. There’s obviously so much pressure, but the problem we have is there’s a background of pretty low morale within the NHS anyway.Tap to see where COVID- is near youWe’re already short of staff on any given normal day without the pressure of the pandemic.The NHS has a tremendous ability to instil camaraderie amongst staff, but that’s really being tested at the moment because we all have our own anxieties.My parents are elderly, and they would be in the category where they’ve got underlying health problems, so I’ve stopped seeing them completely.Naturally we’re more susceptible to this, and because we don’t know who’s positive and who’s not, you could come across a patient, be treating them, and not be wearing the full protection.The other worry for doctors is that we’re being told there may be a rationing of personal protective equipment.Plus, the advice for the public [ they come into contact with someone whos infected] would be to self-isolate for seven days.But what’s happening with NHS staff is they start self-isolating, but then many of them have had a phone call asking them to come back into work... potentially becoming a risk to patients and other staff.They’ve spoken about cancelling annual leave for staff. That hasn’t happened yet but they’re compiling a list of volunteers.There’s also plans in place to redeploy other doctors, such as GPs, and bringing retired doctors back too.I worry that we’re leaving this too late for us [UK] to go into lockdown.We’re pretty full and although we can find physical space, the problem is we don’t have the staff.The government have said they’ll try to get more ventilators made, which is great and shows they’re listening, but we need healthy staff to come into work to be able to operate them.Our view is thatyou prioritise the testing of staff, then those of us that are negative can come back and we don’t have to self-isolate for seven days.Day by day we’re getting more and more prepared, but the problem will come when we’re overwhelmed on the unit and we’ve got staff going off sick. Then we’re really struggling.Dr Yaso Browne is a GP in a practice in Southampton. Dr Browne says: As we hear of more cases, our colleagues being affected, and knowing that we don’t have sufficient personal protective equipment, it makes us feel vulnerable.We support the efforts that are out there, but we’re all a bit fearful - we’re not currently being allowed to be tested unless we’re symptomatic.Also,we are, then actually we don’t get the test back in very good time.I think a bit more understanding about the testing, its supply, and what the capacity is would be hugely beneficial.For now, I think the feeling is we’re feeling vulnerable, rather than stressed. I sense people wanting to do something positive to try and help make us feel stronger, for our patients and for ourselves.I’ve actually chosen to limit my interactions with other people, because I’m worried that I’m high risk - so particularly limit interactions with those that I identy as more at risk.I think really it’s just more about trying to reduce the potential that you’re transmitting to family members. I do have loved ones that I’d worry about because they are at risk.But that’s also why you’d want to knowyou’ve had COVID, because then you’d probably be more able to have those social interactions.We haven’t seen any obvious solutions yet, so it is a really worrying issue for all of us.”Or you can like our coronavirus Facebook page here: https:www.facebook CoronavirusLatestTheSun Leaanne Pallant is a -year-old agency nurse in Hertfordshire. She is married to teacher Richard, and has two children, Poppy, seven and Isla, nine.She says: “On Sunday I worked on an isolation ward where  patients were being tested for the virus and a few were struggling to breathe.There was one case of coronavirus in the hospital at that time, in the Intensive Care Unit , and one case on our ward who was strongly suspected of having it.It was quite scary seeing the specialists dressed in the full-on protective gear. It really hit home that this is getting pretty serious now.All the patients are in separate isolation rooms and nurses or healthcare professionals are having to glove and gown and mask up before we go into that room.Then we have very strict degloving, taking your apron off and then washing your hands in a particular way, to protect yourself.We also have to have a runner so we don’t have to take everything offwe need something brought in, and drug charts are banned, so we’re almost doing patient identication through the window before administering drugs.The NHS was stretched before this, but the coronavirus is putting extra strain on it.As an agency nurse, who fills in on an ad hoc basis, there are a ridiculous amount of shts being advertised out and a lot of people dont want to put themselves in that situation.So nurses are actually cancelling extra shts that they dont have to be doing.I dont worry about myself catching the virus because Im  and I think my immune system is pretty tip top, and the children don’t have any underlying health issues.But  I have an elderly nan who I try and see once or twice a week. Ive had to say to her, ‘Sorry Nanyou need me to do an online shop for you I will but other than that, Im not going to be coming to see you,’ because I could have it and not know.I would never forgive myselfI gave it to her. So there is a lot of trying to distance myself and just be sensible, under the circumstances.As nurses, were exposed to a lot of bugs and viruses and its part and parcel of the job but this is an unknown virus so there are a lot of questions we don’t know the answer to.I went to do my normal weekly shop today and theres literally nothing on some shelves. It was post-apocalyptic.But le has to go on, and all we can really do is try and protect the people that need protecting.The country as a whole is doing what they can and what they need to do.I just hope that everybody is understanding and does isolatethey need to rather than being stupid about it.  Because it could be those few stupid people that ruin it for the majority.”Dr Robert Hirst, , works as an emergency medicine trainee in Bristol. He says: We have a few COVID patients here now, and theres a few more coming in.Were cancelling elective surgeries from Thursday here and just moving to emergency and cancer surgeries primarily.Weve been told were going to be redeployed to whoever needs us in the coming weeks - I imagine Ill be moving into the emergency department or intensive care soon.Its tense at the moment, its quite unknown and we all sort of feel like were at the beginning of something... its probably going to get worse before it gets better.Ive seen emails from other trusts saying the previous advice given doesnt apply to healthcare workers... but luckily no-one has been called in here from self-isolation yet.Its going to be a prolonged process here, it could be six months, there could be another peak in the winter, theyre having to be more sustainable with this.If this was a one-off major event, wed all be called in and it would be all hands on deck for a few days, but this is longer.A main concern for me is I live with my girlfriend and Im worried I could bring my work home with me in a very unpleasant way.Fundamentally wed be fine, but its the chance we could pass it on to my grandparents. We were supposed to meet them this weekend for my birthday but were having to hold off.Normally when you suit up its protection for the patients, but now its protection for the patients and for yourself and anyone  you come into contact with.I know a lot of people are concerned and we hear lots of rumours of young doctors being ill or in intensive care, or even have passed away, so I know its something that weighs on peoples lives.This very much could go downhill, but we just dont know yet.Dr Murray Ellender is a London GP and co-founder of eConsult. “GPs are having to think about fundamentally changing the way we work, and coming up with ways of managing the patients without them necessarily coming into the building.It’s disrupting the model of general practice - which is probably not a bad thing - but it’s happening faster than we would have expected or hoped.There’s a lot of worry about coronavirus and people with respiratory symptoms, but we’ve also got the everyday general practice with people coming in needing repeat prescriptions or with other health conditions.We’re having to manage the normal day job as well as people presenting with respiratory problems.It’s putting all sorts of pressures on the system and there’s the added concern of how we look after the workforce.If you’ve got a practice that’s got four or five GPs, you might have one who’s pregnant who’s now been advised they shouldn’t be at work, what impact does that have on the rest of the practice staff We’re having to manage increased demand with perhaps a slightly diminished workforce.Most GP practices, which have around , patients typically, are now looking at how they can work together when doctors are having to go into isolation.I’ve got a couple of colleagues who’ve had confirmed coronavirus. One of my partners is Clare Gerada, who’s been in ious press at the weekend talking about her experience of the illness.We have others who are now in isolation because they’ve either got symptoms or are pregnant.What we’re thinking through now is, ‘How can we still make use of their expertise and get them working from home ’Anyone who is in isolation who is feeling well enough to work can use a laptop to deal with certain patient queries remotely. And actually that helps them support the wider system.The system we founded, eConsult, is used in around , practices across the UK with half of all practices using that or a similar online consultation system.But half the country has nothing and the NHS is scrambling to make online consultation available to everyone.Practices are now asking, ‘How can we get this  And fast ’Last year, we were bringing about  practices a month on board. In the last couple of weeks, we’ve been bringing about  practices a day. It’s just gone nuts.There is a certain amount of fear amongst clinicians as well as the general public.We have some who’ve got long-term conditions or are the carers for elderly relatives.As so often happens, we don’t do enough in any society to look after healthcare workers. And they don’t tend to be very good at being looked after either - they tend to make very bad patients!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid.

Chunk didn’t.To his eternal credit he ignored two ad breaks and kept up the pressure for a spellbinding  minutes that only ended when Nandy offered to settle the issue of whether Floyd Mayweather should be able to box women by “setting up a commission”.To which Piers responded: “It’s not a commission issue, it’s a common sense issue.”But that, as a wise man once said, is the problem with common sense, Piers.

As we learn about the risk of pre-term birth and coronavirus infection, we will update this information.As this is a new virus, there is limited evidence about managing coronavirus infection in those who have just given birth.However, there are no reports of women diagnosed with coronavirus during the third trimester of pregnancy having passed the virus to their babies while in the womb.Andyou have suspected or confirmed coronavirus at the time your baby is born, your baby will be tested for coronavirus.Based on the current government advice, you may be asked to self-isolateyou have symptoms of coronavirus, such as a high temperature or a new, continuous cough, or youve been tested positive for the illness.Pregnant women who have been advised to self-isolate should stay indoors and avoid contact with others for  days.The NHS guidance on self-isolation currently recommends people should:You may wish to consider online fitness routines to keep active, such as pregnancy yoga or Pilates.Pregnant women are advised not to attend maternity triage units or AE unless in need of urgent pregnancy or medical care.The RCOG said: If you have concerns about the wellbeing of yourself or your unborn baby during your self-isolation period, contact your midwe, or out-of-hours, your maternity team.They will provide further advice, including whether you need to attend hospital.If attendance at the maternity unit or hospital is advised, pregnant women are requested to travel by private transport, or arrange hospital transport, and alert the maternity triage reception once on the premises, prior to entering the hospital.As a precautionary approach, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus when they go into labour, are being advised to attend an obstetric unit for birth.This way the baby can be monitored using continuous electronic fetal monitoring, and the mums oxygen levels can be monitored hourly.As this can only take place in an obstetric unit, where doctors and midwives are present, it is not currently recommended that you give birth at home or in a midwe led unit, where only midwes would be present.The experts also say that there is no evidence to suggest that you cannot give birth vaginally - or that youd be safer having a c-section.Therefore your birth plan should be followed as closely as possible based on your wishes.However,your respiratory condition suggested that urgent delivery would be needed, a caesarean birth may be recommended.The experts added: There is no evidence that women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cannot have an epidural or a spinal block.However, the use of gas and air may increase aerosolisation and spread of the virus, so your maternity team will discuss all the options with you in early labour to ensure you are aware of the pain relief options available to you.The RCOG says that you should contact your midwe or antenatal clinic to inform them that you are currently in self-isolation for possible confirmed coronavirus and request advice on attending routine antenatal appointments.It is likely that routine antenatal appointments will be delayed until isolation ends.If your midwe or doctor advises that your appointment cannot wait, the necessary arrangements will be made for you to be seen.For example, you may be asked to attend at a dferent time, or in a dferent clinic, to protect other patients.If you have confirmed coronavirus infection, as a precautionary approach, an ultrasound scan will be arranged  days after your recovery, according to health officials.This  day period may be reduced as more information on how infected people are in recovery becomes available, they added.If you have recovered from coronavirus and tested negative for the virus before you go into labour, where and how you give birth will not be affected by your previous illness.Provided your baby is well and doesn’t require care in the neonatal unit, you will be kept together after you have given birth - so you can still have skin-to-skin contact.There are some reports from China which suggest women with confirmed coronavirus have been advised to separate from their baby for  days.However, this may have potential negative effects on feeding and bonding and women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor.Prof Van-Tam also said that women shouldnt stop breastfeedingthey show coronavirus symptoms.He said: The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has looked at this for us and concluded that there is no obvious risk associated with breastfeeding.As you know breastfeeding is incredibly important for the baby, its incredibly important for mother and baby bonding.Our advice at the moment is that with respect thats an inidual womans choice as to whether she breastfeeds, but our advice is that this is the best thing to do.The RCOG added that there is some evidence to suggest that they could be a group of asymptomatic iniduals with very minor symptoms that are carrying the virus - however the incidence is unknown.Last week, the professional body updated its guidance to say that as a precautionary measure, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus are advised to attend an obstetric unit when they go into labour - but their birth plan should be followed as closely as possible.Following the policy announcement made by the UK government last night, the RCOG said that along with the Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, it would be updating its guidance as soon as possible.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating.

To do so, they used the tail of the narwhals, called the fluke.Zackary, of Arizona University, said: “The narwhal tusk is a sexually selected signal that is used during the male-male tusking contests.The information that the tusk communicates is simple: ‘I am bigger than you’.”The narwhal is a medium-sized species of whale with a large tusk that ies from in to more than ft — earning it the nickname the “unicorn of the seas”.In fact it is not a true tusk but an enlarged spiral-shaped canine tooth that pushes through the narwhal’s flesh.The findings were published online by the journal Biology Letters.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

sending shrapnel through the foyer killing himself and  innocent gig-goers in a terror attack that horried the nation.The haunting CCTV was released after brother Hashem Abedi, , was yesterday found guilty of mass murder over his part in the atrocity.Hashem, who was , miles away in Libya at the time of the blast, was the ringleader in the attack and helped his brother source nuts and bolts to pack into the IED.The monster denied he was a terrorist - but the Old Bailey heard how he was every bit as responsible as his older brother as he plotted further bloodshed across the world.Heartbroken families of the victims wept as jurors took less than five hours to convict him  counts of murder, one count of attempted murder encompassing the injured survivors, and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions.But there was fury as coward Hashem Abedi refused to appear in court for the verdict and avoided the dock to give evidence during the seven-week trial.Daryl Price, whose son John Atkinson, , was among those killed in the blast, said: The last few weeks have been draining, both mentally and physically, and when the jury read out their decision it felt like somebody had kicked me in the stomach.I was expecting it but it still knocked the wind out of me, I couldnt breathe for a few seconds.I am annoyed that he couldnt make an appearance in court to face those people whose lives he ruined.I had planned to go to London for the verdict, I wanted to look him right in the eye, but he is too much of a coward for that.During his trial, the Old Bailey heard how the sadistic brothers spent months hatching the bloodbath - using bank accounts of pals to buy chemicals online.The pair used their mums £-a-week benefit payments, which she continued to receive after she left the UK for Libya, to buy tools.They flew back to Libya when friends noticed signs they had been radicalised but just days before the attack, Salman Abedi ed to Manchester.Haunting CCTV caught him skulking around the arena at a Take That gig on a practice run.And Hashem Abedi, a former electronics student, continued advising him by phone — and is believed to have been the last person he spoke to when he stopped at a bench on his way to the gig.Salman later left for the nearby Arndale shopping centre where he bought batteries and a blue Kangol suitcase so he could move his bomb-making equipment to the flat he rented in Manchester city centre.He was then caught in chilling CCTV images with a rucksack packed with thousands of nuts just  seconds before the deadly blast.Salman Abedi waited for around an hour in the Manchester Arena foyer before parents and children left the gig at .pm.One minute later, he detonated the bomb as  people stood in the City Room - with  declared dead at the scene.Among debris found after the blast were , nyloc nuts,  flanged nuts,  plain nuts and  fragments from Salman Abedi and his victims.There were also screws recovered by investigators but they were so damaged they couldnt be counted.Images shown to jurors also feature charred clothing recovered from the scene and labels from vegetable oil used to make the bomb.Among other debris were fragments from a money tin decorated with the design of a £ note also used to maim innocent gig-goers.The youngest victim, Saffie-Rose Roussos, eight, suffered more than  external injuries, with  metal nuts in her body, and died from blood loss due to multiple injuries.Student Chloe Rutherford, , suffered more than  injuries, including a brain injury which would have left her immediately unconscious, the court was told.Jurors also heard Salman Abedis body was later recovered in four parts and he had to be identied by his DNA and fingerprints.Forensic investigators later found more than , nuts from the homemade bomb at the scene.After the blast, Hashem Abedi denied he was an extremist but the court heard his DNA was discovered in a Nissan Micra used to store packs of nails for the bomb.Saman Abedi was captured in CCTV footage ing to the car after his Take That practice run four days before the terror attack.The brothers were born in Manchester to Libyan parents and booked one-way tickets the country in April  after stockpiling chemicals used to make the homemade explosive.Salman Abedi then ed to his native Manchester on May  to carry out the atrocity.Hashem repeatedly denied any knowledge of his brother’s plot and suggested he had been conned into believing the bomb parts were for household use.He was arrested by Libyan authorities soon after the attack but an extradition bid proved dficult because of the civil war raging in the North African country.The Sun on Sunday revealed the extradition bid cost UK taxpayers £,.Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Barraclough said: If you look at these two brothers, they are not kids caught in the headlights of something they dont understand.These two men are the real deal, these are proper jihadis - you do not walk into a space like the Manchester Arena and kill yourself with an enormous bomb like that, taking  innocent lives with you,you are not a proper jihadist.He was with his brother throughout the entire process of making this explosive and building this bomb, I believe he provided encouragement right up to the end.This was all about the sick ideology of Islamic State and this desire for martyrdom.Victoria Higgins, from law firm Slater and Gordon, which represented  of the bereaved families, said after the verdicts: “Families have waited a long time to see Hashem Abedi face justice for his crimes and I think the overwhelming emotion for most will be one of relief that he cannot hurt anyone .“It has been incredibly painful for them to hear, in detail, what happened to their loved ones and the calculated way in which the Abedi brothers plotted to end their lives.”Abedi will be sentenced at a later date.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThousands of people who’ve failed fit-for-work tests face being “stuck” without benefits thanks to coronavirus, campaigners have warned. Welfare charity ZK claimed people who are already midway through the appeal system face being trapped while the DWP deals with the outbreak. Director Marc Francis told MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee: “We anticipate there are tens of thousands of people who are stuck in the ‘mandatory reconsideration’ stage for Employment and Support Allowance. We’re anticipating there’s going to be quite long delays in mandatory reconsiderations being completed. We can’t have a situation where people are left for months on end without being able to apply for that.”Employment and Support Allowanceis one of the main sickness and disability benefits, worth £. a week. But well over , people each month lodge an appeal after being refused the benefit in a fit-for-work test. The first stage of that appeal is an internal process called a mandatory reconsideration . Yet waiting times for an MR have shot up from an all-time low of six days last summer to  days in January.People can claim for Universal Credit, which replaced ESA, but ZK advise against it because it is dficult to go back to the old system once a claim has started. Campaigners also demanded the government halt all benefit reassessments of disabled people already in the system. The DWP announced this week it would halt face-to-face assessments of people for disability benefit for at least three months. But telephone or paper-based assessments may still go ahead. Ayaz Manji of mental health charity Mind added: “It’s a time where particularly now disabled people shouldn’t be experiencing shocks to their income. And we have an assessment process which is very unreliable.  There is a strong case for suspending those reviews altogether in the near future so we can safeguard people during this time.” Meanwhile charities warned people are being given a take it or leave it offer by the DWP midway through a full tribunal appeal - that was less than what they could eventually get.

And she begged Boris Johnson to provide more protective equipment for doctors on the frontline of fighting the coronavirus pandemic.Her question came after reports that UK hospitals are beginning to run out of vital equipment needed to protect nurses and doctors from catching coronavirus from infected patients. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson vowed to ramp up COVID- testing to , people per day within four weeks after anger that not all NHS staff could get a test. NHS staff have said they are unable to get hold of some face masks and other specialist personal protective equipmentwhich is needed to prevent them falling ill. Dr Allin-Khan said: Mr NHS colleagues on the frontline are already stressed with the pressure they face. We are in unprecedented times, I would like to know, where was the forward planning for PPE for our NHS and care staff  Where is the testing for medics  Why are waiting so long for mass testing  And why are social distancing measures merely just suggestions   Prime Minister it is right that we have all put party loyalty aside to work together during this time of national crisis, but we must scale up the response. Without good leadership, the people in this country will start to panic. There must be no more delay, the time to act is now. Mr Johnson said he completely agreed as he thanked Dr Allin-Khan for the work she does in the NHS. He added: I can tell her we have stockpiles of PPE equipment and we are proceeding in accordance with the best scientic advice. And it is the timeliness of those measures which are vital in combatting this epidemic. In fact, that is how you save lives, and I am delighted the UKs approach as been commended not just by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College today, but also by the World Health Organisation.The issue was also raised by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who asked Mr Johnson to explain why the healthcare staff werenapost being prioritised for testing.Mr Johnson said the government is prioritising testing of NHS staff. It may be of the interest of the house to know that we are getting closer to delivering a test that will let people knowthey have the disease.

What no-one appears to have noticed is that the disease has got  times more expensive in the space of a week, and itaposs still in the post. We have had more than  months’ warning of the tidal wave coming our way. To start with, it was dismissed as just another flu, then blamed on bats, and finally an economic headache for eBay traders alone.But we were thick, and we were slow. Today that wave is roaring up the Thames, where after sucking a few poor souls to an early grave it’s going to wipe out those bits of the City still at work.Our economyaposs biggest contributors are services, manufacturing, construction, and tourism. Theyaposre all in shutdown. The governmentaposs big idea is to save them by bailing out the bosses - big and small - but they are ignoring the real problem. The vast majority of us may outlive the virus, but every single survivor is going to be violently mugged afterwards. The Prime Minister and Chancellor say it’s a bump in the road and we’ll be over it in  months. Medics say it’s more likely to be - months. Imperial College London says we won’t be in the clear for  months, or as long as it takes until there is a vaccine. If £bn was all it took when they thought there’d be a couple of weeks of it, and £bn had to be magicked up for  months, then the back of this beermat says that for a year and a half you’re looking at £. TRILLION of government bailout.Or four times what the banking crash cost us in . And remember - that’s just for businesses. Never mind the knock-on costs of healthcare, unemployment and sickness benefit, lost tax revenue and an economy that needs restarting.  It’s also a conservative estimate, considering our annual GDP is at the moment £.tn. Of course, it won’t be next year.After the -month mortgage holiday, the mortgage still has to be paid. After the government-backed, low-interest loan, it has to be ed, with interest. And after you’ve handed out a load of cash to every business owner from Richard Branson down to the local pub landlord, you may find they did not use it in the manner you hoped.The Daily Mail’s economic editor Alex Brummer wrote today:  “The lack of directly-paid support for employees, as outlined above, may prove to be an economic and political mistake. Relying on the kindness of bosses to keep paying wages on borrowed money, for a long time, is placing too much trust in their hands.” He added: A further package of measures which directly places cash into the pockets of British citizens would feel more real than promises of mortgage holidays and access to benefits.”Hooo-weee. Is this a call for a universal basic income I see before me, and in the Daily Mail of all places   But suddenly, the sort of radical socialism even Jeremy Corbyn didn’t have the blind optimism to put in his manesto is looking like a credible idea. There is no other way for the nation to get through an indefinite period of economic shutdown. The average Brit owes £, on credit cards. Mortgage holidays mean the banks will lose billions of guaranteed income. Rent holidays mean landlords default on mortgages, and we all stop servicing our debts the whole Tower of Banking Babel will fall. If staff are paid, rates are eased and tax takes a holiday, businesses can be mothballed. But customers cannot hibernate from this crisis -staff stop being paid, they stop being customers where. Take nursery schools. Fees are paid in advance for each term, so staff get paid regardless of how few toddlers turn up. But the new term starts on April , and how many parents, then, will be sending their children  How many nursery staff will still be in a job in a month’s time, and how many parents will be unable to go back to work   Fighting coronavirus is hard enough. But the real issue is how people get back on their feet afterwards. Chicken soup might get you out of bed, but it won’t pay the bills. If you don’t have a job, are on unpaid leave, are one of the .m self-employed whose savings just went up in smoke, you won’t be able to patronise the pub, shops and other businesses that just reopened.And the chances are this won’t be a -month thing. In China, factories are reopening, but m in-country migrants that form a massive part of its workforce havenapost turned up. When they do, there is a very real risk of a new wave of infections, and a new lockdown. In , the Spanish flu showed its head early in the year then ed with a vengeance in winter. If covid- does the same, we could be facing repeated global shutdowns until NEXT spring. If last weekaposs £bn looks puny and ineffective now, imagine how piddling £bn will look by then. Boris Johnson’s fiscal stimulus is, at present, the equivalent of offering half a paracetamol to someone who needs a ventilator. Itaposs just not enough. Itaposs not aposwhatever it takesapos, because what it is taking is the piss.At Prime Ministeraposs Questions today Labour MP Kevin Brennan said: On the matter of aposwhatever it takesapos, it takes more than a  word slogan, is what I would say to the Prime Minister. And in this case it actually takes a bit of war socialism we need to get money into the pockets of the workers. Has he seen Early Day Motion , which I proposed, about bringing in a temporary universal basic income to support workers and get money where it’s actually needed The PM replied: I hear the honourable gentleman loud and clear… and of course that is one of the ideas that will certainly be considered.First the Mail , and now this. A Thatcherite, Eurosceptic, Commie-bashing Tory PM, saying heaposs considering a universal basic income. Well Iaposll be...Of the  MPs who have signed that motion so far, none are Tory or Lib Dem. But that will change, when they start to see the price of not doing it.With a guaranteed amount in the bank every month, people can still feed their families. They can pay some,not all, of rent and mortgage costs, and when the shutdown ends theyaposll have the wherewithal to begin spending again. The government, too, wonapost have an expensive backlog of benefit claims to deal with. The only way for a nation to keep its head above water is for its citizens to each have a le jacket. The government is already the insurer of last resort, and faces a bill of trillions to mop up this mess. To abandon a single inch of its duty would be to destroy us, and it.Butit were to pay each of the .m households in Britain £, tomorrow, it would cost just £bn. Suddenly, radical socialism is cheap and reasonable. Even to Tories,theyaposre not too thick and slow to do the maths this time.

Multiple sources expect restrictions to be drastically tightened in the coming days as COVID- races ahead in the capital. Emergency laws to be introduced to Parliament tomorrow will include powers to close premises and restrict or prohibit events and gatherings anywhere in the UK,the government chooses to. The Coronavirus Bill will also allow the government to limit activity in any place, vehicle, train, vessel or aircraft - leading to fears there could be restrictions on public transport.Whitehall sources today told the Mirror lockdown-style measures in London - which Boris Johnson admitted is a few weeks ahead of the rest of the country - are imminent.But the exact timing and exact shape of any measures have not been decided. A senior Downing Street source vehemently denied anything had been decided. The governmentaposs advisory group SAGE was meeting from pm today to examine next steps. Unconfirmed reports in The Spectator suggest the current rules on avoiding pubs, clubs and unnecessary social contact - so far voluntary - could be made mandatory. No sources aposfirmlyapos told The Sun there would not be lockdown style measures today or tomorrow. Sources close to London mayor Sadiq Khanaposs office said they expect a tightening of restrictions in the capital in the coming days. However, the shape of any possible measures was unclear. City Hall sources criticised the lack of information from the Government.

Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman today did not rule out a tightening of restrictions in the capital in future. AskedLondon was going to be locked down, he said: It’s a question of what you mean by that.

Bella Cole, from Great Baddow in Essex, can only get the nutrients she needs through a tube which is connected to her small intestine for  hours every night to slowly feed her milk.But throughout the night and day, the toddler is regularly sick, throwing up stomach acid around ten times, Essex Live reports.There is no diagnosed medical reason for why Bella vomits daily, with doctors initially having thought she was suffering a bad case of reflux. But itaposs now thought she has a deep rooted aversion, having never had a positive experience of eating or drinking. Now her parents, who knew something wasnapost right ever since she was a few weeks old, are trying to raise the funds for treatment which could transform her le. Her mum, Philipa Rabbitts, has described the anguish which comes with feeding her daughter, who was born premature at  weeks. She was born weighing just four pounds  ounces, she was a little dot, the -year-old said. They said she was fine and we got discharged but at about two or three weeks old she wasn’t gaining any weight and was vomiting all the time and not eating.  After her parents took her to AE when she was six weeks old, she was put on an NG tube, which goes through the nose, past the throat and down into the stomach to feed her milk - but she still vomited everything back up. We were in and out the hospital with her all the time, Philipa says. After enduring a vicious cycle of constant feeding and vomiting for a year, Bellaaposs parents eventually took her to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge to have a dferent tube put into her small intestine. This bypasses the stomach, but still gives her nutrients. But because the small intestine isnapost a storage organ, it canapost expand, so Bella has to be fed very slowly for  hours overnight by a pump. And she is still frequently sick, to the extent that it has become normal for her and her family. The main time she vomits is at night, at first we didn’t sleep at all,” Philippa continued. It’s weird but it is so normal for us now, which it shouldn’t be. I don’t even hear her sometimes. I don’t always wake up when she does and she tells me. If it’s a bad episode then we wake up.  She will just be sick and say mummy I have been sick. It is normal to her but it shouldn’t be normal. Now it is getting normal we have got to stop the sickness for her to eat or she might never be able to. Philipa and Bellaaposs father, Matthew Cole, are now hoping to seek treatment privately to have another procedure to into her stomach. But with a -month waiting list on the NHS, they need £, to go to a specialist clinic in Austria to help her get off the tube.  Her vomit can be yellow and clear but sometimes there is blood in her vomit where she ruptures the blood vesselsshe has been strained, Philipa said. That’s why we can’t wait a year for the NHS to do the operation, it’s not fair on her. Because of an undiagnosed genetic condition, Bella is also very small and it took her a little bit longer to walk and talk because of the developmental delay. But despite everything, Bella, who now has a nine-month-old brother, Teddy, is always smiling. Bearing in mind she has only been talking a year, she is a massive character, Philipa continued. She’s so happy, she’s a typical three and a half year old, trying to get her own way and considering she has a few issues, she is a very happy child. Everyone knows her where we live in Great Baddow. She didnapost walk or talk until she was two and a half but since then she has come on so far. She grows but really slowly, her brother is nine months old and wearing nine to twelve month old clothes and I can put them on her. With everything up in the air with coronavirus, Bellaaposs parents are concerned that the operation, scheduled for April  at the No Tube Clinic in Austria, could be jeopardised. They have made the decision to pull Bella out of preschool to make sure she stays healthy enough to go. It is essential that Bella can get to the clinic before she turns five, the maximum age at which the clinic can accept children. There is a  percent success rate for weaning tube-dependent children off the tube - which Philipa and Matthew hope will change their daughteraposs le. For her sake, we want her to eat, Philippa says. It would mean everything to us just to get her to eat and get that tube off her. It restricts her because she canapost run around because of how heavy it is. We have to change her tube too and now she is more aware of what is happening. Itaposs heartbreaking for us to have to pin her down and change the tube. She says aposno mummy, no milkapos because she knows as soon as it is in her she is going to vomit. Even daily meal times have become dficult, as Bella can’t sit and eat a meal with her mum, dad and brother. Thankfully at pre-school, the staff all make sure that Bella is never left out and joins in at snack time, evenshe doesn’t eat.

Housemates Andrew Maclean,  and Scott Saunders, , have quarantined themselves inside their home after coming down with a fever, cough and shortness of breath. Mr Maclean and Mr Saunders, from Cheltenham, developed symptoms when they were working at a restaurant and bar, respectively, at the festival - at first thinking they only had colds - and now fear they passed their infection on to others. The pair have questioned why Cheltenham went ahead despite the worsening crisis and the calls for it to be cancelled to prevent the spread of Covid-. Mr Maclean told : Iaposm pretty certain we all have coronavirus in this house. Iaposve never had anything like it before. Have you developed coronavirus symptoms after attending Cheltenham Festival  Email webnews@mirror.   Itaposs the worst I have ever felt. My chest is really tight. The fever is horrendous. The housemates sought medical advice and were told that they wouldnapost be tested and to self-isolate for two weeks. Mr Maclean added: By the second day of the festival we had symptoms. We had the dry cough. He and Mr Saunders didnapost suspect that they had coronavirus. Mr Maclean said: The Jockey Club said that it could just be a common cold so not to worry, so we took their advice and came back in.  They said they were told to take the third day of the festival off as a precaution and come back on the fourth and final day, the Friday,they felt better. Both felt fine on Friday and ed to work, but their conditions deteriorated later and they put themselves into self-quarantine. But by that point they had exposed others to their infection. Mr Saunders said: There were over , people there over the four days of the festival. They were adamant that the precautions they put in place would protect us. Iaposve spoken to others who worked at the festival and they have symptoms. He added: The tightness in the lungs makes it harder to breathe. It feels like your chest and your lungs are being put in a vice. Several Twitter users claimed they developed symptoms four to six days after attending the festival. Health experts have said symptoms normally appear about five days after a patient becomes infected and carriers can be highly contagious before they develop a fever, cough and or aches. In the UK, people with mild symptoms are not being tested. They are being told to self-isolate at home for two weeks. Racing journalist Stephen Power was bedbound for days suffering from a nasty fever, headache, mild cough and back pain - and three other people in his group have similar symptoms.  Mr Power, who was self-isolating after being told he wouldnapost be tested for Covid-, told : The infection feels like youaposve been stuck inside a washing machine, its turns your le upside down. Iaposd wish this on no-one. The writer, who is in his mid-s, said he arrived in Cheltenham a day early, on March , and raced every day of the festival except the final day. He said: I had signicant body changes on Saturday morning. It felt like a bus had hit me.I had a sky high fever, shivers, complete exhaustion, a tiny cough, I was unable to eat for days and drinking fluids is a struggle. Mr Power, from north-west London, described his condition on Twitter, writing: Iaposve been in bed with a nasty fever, headache, mild cough  back pain for nearly  days now, Iaposm completely exhausted  have no urge to move or eat.  Iaposve been in self-isolation at home alone since Friday. I donapost knowthis is the flu or Covid as I canapost get tested.He later wrote: End of day  - Flu or Covid. Iaposve had a rotten day at home alone, symptoms include shivers, fever, headaches and a complete lack of appetite.Iaposve slept on and off all day, moving is a painful task. Iaposm exhausted to the bone, really praying for some relief tomorrow. Goodnight. Itaposs impossible to pinpoint the source of infection, but being in and around thousands of people for a few days would obviously have been the main trigger, logically thinking. Mr Saunders and Mr Maclean have struggled in isolation, especially in their attempts to get groceries. The next available delivery slot is several days away and they cannot leave to buy food.  They took annual leave from their jobs - where they had zero hours contracts - to work at the racecourse and will not have jobs toto when their self-quarantine is finished, giving them worries about being able to pay their rent. Mr Saunders works in a bar that is now closed due to the outbreak and Mr Maclean decided he had to leave his job due to the theof time in quarantine and dficulties getting to and from work as public transport services are reduced. They have launched a GoFundMe page to ask for help. Several Twitter users say they are now suffering from a fever, aches and a cough after the annual festival in Gloucestershire went ahead despite the outbreak.As photos showed crowds of up to ,, there were fears that the four-day event would fuel the spread of Covid- and racergoers would then carry the virus back their home towns all over the UK. In the aftermath, a racecourse member tweeted that he had a ridiculous fever while housebound for four days and quite a few of us have had symptoms.  One punter wrote that his dry cough and fever came on  days after being at Cheltenham. A man claimed his brother had tested positive for coronavirus and medics told him that he likely caught it at Cheltenham Festival given the timeframe. There was outrage and shock when it was announced that the event would go ahead as planned. There were calls for it to be postponed or cancelled amid fears racegoers would be exposed to the virus. A number of punters now believe they contracted the flu-like illness while they were crammed in shoulder to shoulder.  One man wrote on Twitter: I live in Cheltenham and am a member, so went all  days and it probably shouldnapost have went ahead. Quite a few of us have had symptoms, I had a ridiculous fever Saturday to Monday and I havenapost left the house for  day, WFH for the foreseeable future! A man from Leeds said his brother had tested positive. He tweeted: I didn’t realise but he’s been tested and they’ve just confirmed he’s COVID positive. He caught it at Cheltenham festival.

Derek Nally, , and Gemma Stubbs, , were set to tie the knot on Saturday,  years to the day they first met. But they have now decided to cancel due to the flu-like virus which is now causing a global health emergency.  Derek, who is from Great Barr in Pheasey, West Midlands, said the realisation their big day might not go ahead dawned on them after Prime Ministeraposs press conference on Monday, where he asked the country to begin practising social distancing. That was the moment we realised we would have to rethink, he explained.Follow our LIVE blog for updates on the coronavirus outbreak We could have put a buffet out and people could look around and think ‘I’m going to get coronavirus’. Also the photographer is pregnant. She was originally quite happy to go forward, but when they said that pregnant woman was at risk, she cancelled. Derek, who works in the manufacturing industry and Gemma, a primary school cleaner, say they are devastated by the delay. They had chosen their wedding day to coincide not only with the anniversary of their first date in , but seven years since Gemma said aposyesapos to Derekaposs proposal in August . The couple - who have three children - were first introduced by Gemmaaposs mother, who met Derek at a social club he used to run. I met her mother first and we got on very well and she brought her daughter in to meet me, Derek continued. Weaposre broken. It has hit us both pretty bad. I think last night when we threw in the towel, there was a sense of relief, but also the realisation that all our hard work has been for nothing. I’m not going to say I’m depressed and ready to jump off a bridge, but it is definitely affecting my mood. I tried to tell my mum last night and she was in bits. Just thinking about it again has given me goosebumps.  But the couple are taking it all their stride and say they have no hard feelings. The people we spoke to have been really understanding of the situation - I have to give them credit, Derek said. They have offered not to charge us againwe can find a day that works for all of us. I definitely don’t blame the government. They are trying to put a plan in place for something that’s never happened before. When the advice was ‘wash your hands and sing happy birthday’, I was over the moon. Boris is going to get a lot of criticism for not closing down the pubs and clubs where we were going to have our after party sooner, but I can see them all being cancelled. The government has advised the British public to:Avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants and all social gatherings Cease all unnecessary travelEveryone should work from home where possible Mass gatherings and sporting events have been cancelled Avoid “all but essential travel” to more than  countries If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for  days Pregnant women, those over , and people with certain health conditions have been asked to stay at home for  weeks Schools will remain open  The couple are now hoping they can rearrange their wedding for their next anniversary - even though this would mean waiting another year. Personally, it is not something we discussed just yet, but my plan B would be to do it next year, Derek added. Aim for the anniversary again but it just means waiting another year.The UK now has , confirmed cases of  coronavirus  after  more patients were diagnosed with the potentially deadly illness in the biggest day-on-day increase so far."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus heres how find number","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Heres how to find the number of cases of COVID- in your areaThe virus has largely affected every region of the UK - use our widget to enter your post code and see the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in your areaShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video what-coronavirus-testing-like-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-heres-how-find-number-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains.

Cassian Coates had a fever and cold for a number of days so concerned parents Myroslava and Callum took him to hospital.

All the couple could do was laugh, such was shock, as they couldnapost believe their baby had caught the infectious disease. Mrs Coates added: We wondered where he caught it because my husband and I are both fine. I did panic but I cannot express how fantastic and reassuring our GP was. They said that with children this age they are diagnosing by symptoms.  We were told to go home to self-isolate for two weeks and keep giving him Calpol asit was a cold. The mother-of-one added that she did not think the guidelines had been clear enough, and that after they posted the news of Cassianaposs positive test on social media they had been inundated with questions from other parents.

As European nations crackdown on freedom of movement, and encourage people to work from home, what can you expectyou fall sick with the novel flu.Since the outbreak was announced in Wuhan, China, in December , medical professionals have been grappling to understand the virusaposs symptoms and how they can be treated, Somerset Live reports. Health experts say that the risk of becoming critically ill remains low and not everyone who contracts the virus will become ill. Those who do are likely to experience symptoms similar to that of a normal bout of flu. Now, the experiences of some of those that have recovered from the virus sheds some light on what we should prepare for. . Painful sinuses Painful sinuses are common when you get a fair few strains of a cold or the flu. Sinusitis can leave you feeling awful, both physically and mentally. Pain, most often paired with a dull pressure, generally occurs when your sinuses become inflamed and swollen. You may feel pain in your forehead, on either side of your nose, in your upper jaws and teeth, or between your eyes. While suffering with coronavirus, one man said that his sinuses were agony. Connor Reed, a resident of the Chinese city of Wuhan, is believed to be one of the first Brits to have caught coronavirus. Connor, who is originally from North Wales, contracted the virus in November  - a whole month before Chinese authorities officially announced the outbreak. After  days of feeling ill, recording his day-to-day le in his diary, Connor was treated at a hospital that diagnosed him as being one of the first people to get the new strain of coronavirus, Covid-. The -year-old English teacher described his symptoms starting out with just a snfle which he tried to medicate using hot whisky and honey, before succumbing to what he believed was the flu around a week in. In his diary he wrote: This is no longer just a cold. I ache all over, my head is thumping, my eyes are burning, my throat is constricted. He said his aposbones were achingapos and he had a aposhacking coughapos.  A few days later, the pneumonia had gone but he said he ached asIaposve been run over by a steamroller. My sinuses are agony, and my eardrums feel ready to pop. I know I shouldn’t but I’m massaging my inner ear with cotton buds, trying to take the pain away. Just a couple of days later, he reported feeling better. . Ear pressure As Connor discovered, another of the symptoms of coronavirus is pressure in the ears that make them feel ready to pop. But unlike Connor, you shouldnapost be pushing cotton buds into your ears to try and relieve the pressure - youaposll end up doing more harm than good. Because many of the virusapos symptoms are flu-like, this ear pressure is most likely to be caused by clogged up tubes in your ear thanks to all the nastiness of a virus inside your system. More scientically speaking, when the Eustachian tubebecomes clogged, you can feel fullness and pressure in your ear, as well as some muffled hearing and sometimes even earache. These ear congestion symptoms can also be caused by problems in your middle ear or the ear canal that affects the eardrum. So sometimes itaposs just a case of waiting for the virus to pass. . Thumping headache Again, a pounding or thumping headache is sometimes typical of a bad cold or the flu. But it can also be a symptom of other things too, such as tiredness, dehydration and even a lack of iron in your system.  So donapost go panicking straight awayyouaposve got a bit of a sore head. Make sure you drink plenty of water, get plenty of rest and try to relax. Take time away from your computer screen and avoid alcohol. Health experts are advising anyone suspected of suffering with coronavirus symptoms to take Paracetamol instead of ibuprofen, but keep yourself updated on all the latest NHS information, as things may change as more tests are done on the virus.. . Burning eyes The best way to describe the sensation of burning eyes is to compare it with the itchiness and irritation you would faceyou suffer with hayfever or other allergies. This kind of itchiness and irritation can also come about when you’re among smog, smoke, dust, mold and even animals. The only dference between these cases and the cases described by coronavirus patients, is the fact that the virus triggers this symptom and not an external factor like pets. . Constricted throat It seems as though patients suffering with COVID- experience a mixture of cold and flu-like symptoms, paired with typical symptoms of a small allergic reaction. A constricted throat can be due to swelling and inflammation, brought about after lots of coughing, which we know to be a common occurrence among coronavirus sufferers.  But a constricted throat can also be caused by an infection, allergic reaction, as well as a iety of other conditions. If you find yourself really struggling to breathe, swallow or find any lumps or bumps you’ve not seen before, you may need to be checked by a doctor immediately. So, it’s wise to keep monitoring your symptoms, in a diary like Connor, so you can see when things are beginning to change. . Aches all over It’s no secret that having a cold or a bout of flu normally comes with feeling achy. And coronavirus is no dferent.  Those falling ill with the virus have described aches and pains all over their body, not just as a result of blocked sinuses, ears or nose, but also in their arms, legs and chest too. Many people will find the current coronavirus outbreak a stressful time, too, and this stress and tension can also worsen these aches and pains. . Lungs that apossound like a paper bagapos If when you breathe, your lungs sound almost crackly, then this could be a sign of something more serious than just your average cold or flu. This sort of noise can often occurthe small air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, as well as the air you’re breathing in and out. These air sacs filling with fluid can often happen as a result of pneumonia - which is a condition linked to coronavirus. If your breath sounds wheezy, this may be down to an inflammation of the bronchial tubes in your lungs. . Fatigue Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling extremely tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult. Jaimuay Sae-ung, , was the first Thai national to contract coronavirus in December last year. Despite having underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, Jaimuay survived the illness after doctors isolated her at a hospital in Thailand for treatment.  Her symptoms included a fever and a bad cough, but she developed pneumonia while in quarantine and her family were worried she may not survive. I only knewafter I came to the hospital, the mother of seven told Sky News. I felt a bit sad, a bit shocked, tired and fatigued and I couldnapost eat. Jaimuay said she argued with doctors and nurses at the hospital because she believed she didnapost need to stay there. After  days, her condition had improved and she was eventually discharged following two negative test results. . Lack of appetite Jaimuay also mentioned not being able to eat while suffering with coronavirus. The saying goes that you should feed a cold and starve a fever, so not managing to eat much may help to burn off coronavirus in the long run. Of course, those who are ill should be sure to keep their energy up. . A fever When coronavirus was first brought to people’s attention, a fever was one of the first symptoms to be on the look out for. It was later advised thatyou had been in contact with, or indeed lived with, anyone who had a fever, you should self-isolate. For some people, this is the only symptom of coronavirus they get. One young man, who did not want to be identied, is being treated for coronavirus in hospital after ing home from a short trip and noticing his temperature had risen, the Irish Mirror reports.  He told the RTE’s Claire Byrne Live show: “The only symptoms I had was, basically, the fever. I didn’t have any respiratory problem, any lung inflammation, any cough, any sneezing so was just the fever. “I actually feel great now. I had a fever for a couple of days and now from Friday, I don’t have any more symptoms and so I am just here in the hospital being tested for the virus. The man said he was a “little worried” but “not scared” and said he can not leave the hospital until two consecutive tests show he has tested negative for Covid-. He added: The only thing I would say is that it is boring, I am here and I just have to read, watch some movies and that’s the only things. Apart from that I am fine.” . Tight chest and coughing spells Another of the first symptoms of coronavirus to be identied, was a tight chest and persistent cough. Many scientists and health professionals have suggested that the water droplets passed through a cough or sneeze are the main cause of the virus spreading, which is why they have advised the entire population to wash their hands, cough and sneeze into a flexed elbow and use tissues wherever possible. Having these symptoms on their own has meant that some people with the virus have not considered the possibility that they may have Covid-. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Carl Goldman from Santa Clarita, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship and later tested positive for coronavirus, said the virus aposhasnapost been that badapos. In an article for The Washington Post, he explained that he developed a fever and aposa bit of a coughapos during his flight back to America and was quarantined on his . I am in my late s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out for a few days, he said. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells.  If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual. His treatment, he said, consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade. . Jet lag One coronavirus sufferer described her symptoms as feeling like jet lag - a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Your body has its own internal clock, or circadian rhythms, that sends signals to your body telling it when to stay awake and when to sleep. Similar to fatigue, the feeling of jet lag can make people feel that they’re not quite with it or even a bit spaced out. Bridget Wilkins, who lives in London, flew to Australia via Singapore for a friendaposs wedding last week - but is now quarantined in a hospital in Brisbane after testing positive for coronavirus.The -year-old said the symptoms she had suffered included a headache, a sore throat and tiredness.Without realising she had contracted the virus, she believed her symptoms were from jetlag after her long flight. Speaking to Australiaaposs NEWS she said she had still had symptoms but aposnothing more than thatapos. “There’s a lot of hype and hysteria on the news around coronavirus,” she said. “There should be. It’s very serious, particularly for the elderly and people with existing conditions. But I think we have to calm down, because for most people, like myself, it is just a long cold that we can shake off.

Spain and Italy are in lockdown, while drastic measures have been introduced in the UK to stop the spread of the virus. In the UK , people have now been confirmed as having cases of the bug and as of yesterday, Britain’s death toll stood at . People who live alone and have any symptoms of coronavirus are being told to self-isolate for seven days. In homes where other people live, everyone in the house must self-isolate for  days. People are being urged to stay away from pubs, bars, restaurants,  the theatre and other social gatherings while the most at risk could be told to self-isolate for at least  weeks. The most vulnerable groups include those over the age of , anyone with underlying health problems who is routinely offered an NHS flu jab and pregnant women. A series of emergency measures have now been introduced across Britain, including financial help for those affected by COVID-. Supermarkets have now started to restrict how much shoppers can buy. Sainsburyaposs and Asda have said they will stop shoppers buying more than three of any singlefood item. Sainsburyaposs has also said it will prioritise home deliveries to the elderly. Aldi has already restricted shoppers to four of any one item while Morrisons is stepping up its online deliveries. Recently retired NHS staff are being asked toto work to help manage the crisis, police will be able to enforce public health measures and some court cases will be held by video link. Boris Johnson has also offered home owners affected by coronavirus a three month mortgage holiday while a £billion loan package is being offered to firms hit hardest by the crisis.Aside from managing the outbreak, scientists across the world have been working round-the-clock to develop a vaccine. The first human trials of a new vaccine scientists hope will protect against Covid- have been carried out. The US National Institutes of Health, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, has been working with biotech company Moderna to produce the preventative medication. It was tested on humans for the first time, US health officials confirmed. A -year-old mother-of-two was the first person to receive the vaccine. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the trials were an important first step. The first stage of the trial will test the vaccine on  males and non-pregnant females between the ages of  and , with them receiving a second dose  days after the first. However, it may be another  to  months before the vaccine can be brought into widespread use. Infectious disease expert Dr John Tregoning told the BBC: ”This vaccine uses pre-existing technology. Itaposs been made to a very high standard, using things that we know are safe to use in people and those taking part in the trial will be very closely monitored. Yes, this is very fast - but it is a race against the virus, not against each other as scientists, and itaposs being done for the benefit of humanity. But it will still take around three months to complete the first round of human testing, which then needs to be followed by another eight months or so of clinical trials. Vaccines need to give your body a snapshot of the disease, this can be done by weakened forms of the virus or something that mimics it, so the body knows what to fight. However, as coronavirus is a totally new infection, it is not yet known how it will behave. There are three rounds of testing when it comes to vaccine. The first involves small groups of people and are designed to make sure it is safe for human consumption. Then, the second round involves hundreds of volunteers, who are then monitored by scientists to determine how their body will respond the the jab.

The official number of confirmed cases stands at , in the UK but experts claim that number could be far higher. The death toll now stands at  and in a bid to stem to spread of coronavirus, the government has introduced a raft of drastic measures. Across the world, the figure could be as high as ,. People are being urged to stay away from pubs, bars, restaurants, the theatre and other social gatherings while the most at risk could be told to self-isolate for at least  weeks. The most vulnerable groups include those over the age of , anyone with underlying health problems who is routinely offered an NHS flu jab and pregnant women. The UK’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said: The group of people who we would want to take this advice particularly seriously are older people above , people who in adult le would normally be advised to have the flu vaccination. So these are people with chronic diseases such as chronic heart disease or chronic kidney disease, and also - as a precautionary measure because we are early in our understanding and we want to be sure - women who are pregnant. Anyone who lives alone and has any of the symptoms of COVID- is being told to stay at home for seven days. If you live with other people you need to self-isolate, along with every person in your house, for  days. While increasing numbers of people are being told to work from home and fear being self-isolated for long periods of time, supermarket bosses have pleaded with shoppers to buy goods responsibly. Members of British Retail Consortium sent a joint letter to consumers urging everyone to work together to ensure there is enough food for the country. It comes as scores of shoppers have been panic-buying essentials, including toilet paper, as fears intensy over the spread of Covid-. Retailers are currently working round the clock to help customers get the items they need, the BRC said. The letter aims to reassure customers, while calling on them to support each other during the crisis. It said: We know that many of you are worried about the spread of coronavirus . We want to let you know that we are doing everything we can so that you and your families have the food and essentials you need. The letter added: But we need your help too. We would ask everyone to be considerate in the way they shop. We understand your concerns, but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyonewe all work together. Together we can make sure we are looking out for family, friends, neighbours. Together we will care for those around us and those who are elderly, vulnerable or choosing to remain at home. Shelves have been cleared of many products, such as pasta, tinned vegetables and soups - but toilet roll has been particularly badly affected, with supermarkets stripped bare almost as soon as stocks are replenished. Butyou find yourself without any loo roll, there are alternatives to see you through the coronavirus crisis. Here’s what you can use instead of toilet roll - so don’t panicthe shelves are bare, there are plenty of other options. A bidet - or a home made version A no brainer alternative to toilet paper and loved by luxury hotels across the world. However, not many UK homes are kitted out with a bidet but you can create your own with your shower. It may be a bit tricky but you’ll definitely be clean. Baby wipes or wet wipes Anyone with small children will have these to hand - and they’re perfect for using to wipe your bum. However, the come with a word of warning - do not flush them down the toilet. The wipes can have a devastating impact on the environment and even block up your own toilet system, which would definitely not be ideal at the moment. So instead of flushing them, make sure you put them in the bin and dispose of them with the rest of your rubbish. Reusable fabric toilet wipes They may not sound like the nicest invention ever but when it comes to a never ending supply, these would serve you well. However, they would need washing A LOT - and on very high temperatures.  The loo roll can be picked up on Amazon for £ here.A cloth Again, this might make some people feel a bit queasy, but using a cloth to wipe your bum and then washing and re-using is another way to get round having no loo roll. Just make sure you wash it very carefully between every use.  Hailing from the Philippines, the Tabo is basically a small plastic scoop that you use to pour water over your bottom until you’re clean. It can also be used with soap, which can help with hygiene.

Teesside Crown Court heard how the trio were at the manaposs property in Eston for less than a minute, but that by the end, there was blood everywhere. They arrived at his home in Fenderaposs car just after .pm on August  last year. Fender - to whom he owed the debt - had texted him demanding the money, saying keep on blanking me. They got out, each one armed with a weapon - an axe, a breaker bar and a hammer, said prosecutor Rachel Masters. They then ran into the garden, where their victim was, and grappled with him while threatening to kill him. He ran inside to escape but was hit with weapons and kicked by the armed men, despite his pleas for them to stop. The court heard how Anderson also grabbed him by the throat and threatened him, saying to pay the money.  The horric assault left the man, who is in his s, needing surgery after a deep wound to his right palm. He also had to have a metal plate from a childhood injury to his left arm removed and replaced. In a statement, he spoke of the long-term physical and mental effects of the attack, which he said he struggled to comprehend and did not deserve. He doesnapost knowheaposll ever be the same again, added Ms Masters. His injuries led to him losing feeling and grip in his right hand, affecting daily activities like dressing and feeding himself, which meant he relied on help from his mother. He burned himself repeatedly because he couldnapost feel pain in his nerve-damaged hand, and his fingers were covered in scars. As a result, he worried about his job prospects, struggled financially on universal credit and suffered flashbacks and anxiety. He also told of the impact on his family, and his childaposs heartbreaking wish for him to get better. The three assailants - Fender, Anderson also known as McKenzie and Rooks, all of Guisborough - admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possessing offensive weapons. The defence alleged the victim was in his garden wearing a balaclava and armed with an axe, but the Crown did not accept this. The men had  previous offences between them, though none for such serious violence and no long jail terms. Fender and Anderson had convictions for having weapons, and all three were in breach of suspended sentences. Christopher Baker, defending Fender, said: This is effectively his first taste of custody. This was dreadful behaviour that he involved himself in. He apologises to the victim. Itaposs clear that things spiralled out of control very quickly. He said Fender, who had few previous convictions, had dferent sides to him as a hard-working family man trying to change his le and his imprisonment would affect innocent people.  Nigel Soppitt, representing Anderson, suggested there was provocation, saying: This was a fairly short but sustained attack. His view is they were simply going along to frighten this man. Of course it turned out completely wrong. This is a terrible offence. He realises that in hindsight. It was committed on impulse. He said Anderson had a dficult upbringing, got addicted to drugs at  and had been a real tearaway, but turned his le around since. He left a le of crime behind in the last three years, got into business, employed others and worked tirelessly, until this regretful day when he threw all of that away. Andrew Turton, for Rooks, said he wrote a letter to the court expressing genuine remorse after surrendering to police, and wanted to say sorry in person. He said Rooks acted out of misplaced loyalty and went with friends and colleagues on the spur of the moment into a show of strength in someone aposs argument. He added Rooksapos ADHD might have been part of his poor thinking, he had come off drugs and was described by a prison officer as a good role model. Judge Paul Watson QC told the trio, who brought references to court: The extraordinary thing about this is... thereaposs clearly a good and decent side to each of you. He accepted they went tooled up to the home to give him a bit of a fright, maybe not intending to inflict injury at first. The judge added: It all got completely out of hand.

Martell Watson, from Croydon, claims a worker in the Thornton Heath store said aposnot againapos when they saw what had happened.She was forced to complete the rest of her shopping with just one hand, with none of the staff offering to help her, MyLondon reports.The -year-old was buying dinner for her son when a wet section of the ceiling reportedly fell onto her on March . The mother said: “All of a sudden this thing just literally fell straight on my hand. After a minute and a half one of the workers came over and said, aposnot againapos.” She claimed that staff told her that another tile had fallen earlier that day but not hit anyone. Martell, who has been shopping there for five years, described wanting to cry when the wet tile slapped down onto her hand. The worst part of her ordeal, she explained, was how unsympathetic some of the staff were after her hand became swollen. She said: “I asked the managershe could get me something I could wipe my clothes and hands with. The manager didn’t really acknowledge what I was saying. “She askedI was OK and can I leave you now. I thought, aposwowapos. She swept up all the dust and she left. “I stood in that same position for about  minutes in total, maybe a bit more. It was only the security who askedI wanted a drink or a chair.” After a further wait, Martell said another manager filled out an accident report, but didn’t offer to help her finish her shopping. She said: “They askedI wanted to fill out an accident form and I said aposof course, isn’t that normal procedure apos  “He said head office would contact me and that was it. He didn’t ask me a recollection of what happened, nothing. That was the end of that.” Ms Watson said she asked the second manager for help completing her shopping, but was given no assistance. When she explained to him that she was shocked by the incident, he allegedly asked her why she was upset. She said: “How can you ask me why I’m shocked when something has just fallen from the ceiling on to me  “That made me feel like I wanted to cry there and then because I can’t believe I’m being treated this way. “I’m not saying you have to fall at my feet but, for god’s sake, you don’t want people to complain. You would think they would help you or try and make it better even though it’s already happened. “Nobody helped me. I didn’t see another worker after that. Needing to feed her son that evening, Martell carried on shopping, by now pushing the trolley with one hand. She believes she should have been allowed to skip to the front of the checkout queue to make it easier for her to get home. She said: “I’m just appalled at the way they treated me. It was a total shock and I can’t believe the way they treated me. “It’s your shop. I’m not saying it’s your fault but it’s your shop. It’s close to my work but I would never go back there after being treated like that.” Lidl has since apologised to Martell about the incident. A Lidl spokesperson said: “We were extremely sorry to learn of this matter and sincerely apologise to the customer for any distress caused.

What about workers and renters, Mr Chancellor  The lack of a direct employment protection and support packages is deeply concerning as grafters lose their jobs. Countries such as Denmark and Sweden, and even Donald Trump’s US, are providing real financial support. That there is no three-month rent holiday for tenants – alongside a promised three-month mortgage holiday for buyers – is an insight into Tory priorities. The low earners, the poorest and most insecure are being abandoned to unemployment and possible eviction. Boris Johnson’s wartime rhetoric is shaping up to be yet another con. In , nobody was left behind. Full employment and rationing in a country that pulled together produced the generation who created the National Health Service, the modern welfare state and mass council housing. Sunak’s talks with trade union leaders must be more than window dressing, an attempt to make it appear he’s listening to everyone. Urgent, immediate assistance to sustain the jobs and livelihoods of jeopardised workers is a bottom line. Betray them and this Tory Government will deserve damnation.

More than , people have been confirmed as contaminated by the disease which has killed nearly , since December, but there does appear to be some hope on the horizon. Over , people have successfully recovered worldwide and in mainland China, where the highly-infectious disease originated, only  new cases were confirmed by officials on Tuesday. Just one of those was a domestic transmission. And despite the death toll in Italy - the worldaposs second biggest hotspot - continuing to skyrocket, the confirmed cases are now slowing. Cases are also declining in South Korea - just  yesterday, a signicant drop from  at its peak just over two weeks ago. This comes as researchers in Rotterdam and Utrecht University claim they have found an antibody that can successfully cure a patient of the disease, reports the Sun.  It could lead to a vaccine and also allow people to test themselves at home, freeing up valuable time for struggling health services across the world. Doctors at the Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipar, India, meanwhile, have been using a cocktail of HIV, swine flu and Malaria medication to cure Covid- patients. The Cleveland Clinic also apparently has technology which can turn around coronavirus tests in eight hours - though it still needs further in-house testing. Japanese pharmaceutical firm Takeda Pharmaceutical Co has revealed it is working on a new coronavirus drug which uses blood plasma of recovered patients, and researchers in Ontario, Canada, have replicated the virus which could prove invaluable for testing.

Only the three Ps can be flushed pee, poo and toilet paper. Coliban Water said they experienced a blockage in the system, which spilled into the Bendigo Creek at Long Gully. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. The blockage removed was a combination of paper towel and wet wipes. It caused , litres of waste water to be spilled into the creek, requiring extensive clean up and cost. “We can’t emphasise enough the consequences of sewer spills to both the environment and the community, Dunlop added.    The cost to Coliban Water to remove blockages and clean up spills is a cost to all of us. “Foreign objects can also block plumbing on your own property, costing you money, time and inconvenience of repair and clean up.” The company estimated the consequence of sewer spills will cost around .million of customer money every year.

So instead, she made dozens of microfibre cloths, which she described are environmentally friendly, reusable and cut on flushing water. The mother explained that, once used, the microfibres are put into a bucket full of bleach and then into the washing machine with a bleaching agent. I made  of these microfibre cloths, the woman wrote. After use, they go straight into a bucket of bleach with a lid on it, which sits beside the toilet. Our household alone saves about  flushes per day, so I can justy a small load to wash every couple of days.

But what does it stand for  What does COVID- stand for  COVID- stands for Corona Virus Disease . The name was chosen by the World Health Organisation , with input from OIE Animal Health and FAO. In a statement, director general of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained: We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an inidual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease. Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks. Before it was officially named COVID-, scientists were calling the coronavirus apos-nCoVapos. This covers the year it was discovered, and the fact that it was a novel coronavirus.

We’re just taking it day by day, trying to maintain fitness and looking after ourselves as best we can.“It’s a really hard situation to explain. It doesn’t feel real.“We’ve just been told football’s now stopped and we don’t know when we’ll be playing again.“Everything’s just been shut down all of a sudden and it’s a really weird feeling. It’s not really sunk in yet.”Dundee have gone six matches unbeaten, with five consecutive clean sheets, and sit third in the table.The Dens men are just four points behind second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle, who they were due to play this weekend before the cancellations.Forster said: “The season as a whole hasn’t been good enough for us but the way things were going recently, it was starting to look positive for us with regard to hitting form in the lead-up to the play-offs.“There was a real bit of optimism building and it’s frustrating that that momentum has just been stopped with no indication of when we’re going to be able to play again, andwe are going to be able to play again this season at all.“I’m a big believer that whatever is going to be will be. You can only worry about things you can control # and this situation is definitely out with our control.”The loan signing of Scotland international Christophe Berra from Hearts has made a huge dference.Berra, , was bombed out by Daniel Stendel after the former Barnsley manager’s Tynecastle appointment in December.Forster said: “Big Christophe has done well for us. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s played at a high level so it’s good for defenders like myself to play alongside him.“You can learn loads from a guy like that. We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally. I take a lot of pride in my performance and I feel like over the past couple of years I’ve found a way of managing my body that works well.“I don’t think I’ve missed a game through injury for two years now so long may it continue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united louis appere scotland u 21","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson is thrilled that Louis Appere has been called-up to the Scotland U  squad – evenit means his forward could miss a title-clinching night in Arbroath.The -year-old has enjoyed a career-transforming season after being farmed out to Broughty Athletic juniors.On histo Tannadice, the Fer took his chance in pre-season and has gone on to make  appearances, scoring six goals.Also picked by Scot Gemmill for the U s is Cha’s Billy Gilmour, who had been tipped for a senior call-up ahead of the Euro  play-off semi-final against Israel.Scotland play Croatia at Tynecastle on Friday, March , the same night that United travel to Gayfield.They then face Greece away on Tuesday, March .Neilson may also have to do without Lawrence Shankland,he keeps his place in the full squad for the Euro  play-offs.“It’s phenomenal,” said the United boss.“Louis has been brilliant.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

What is the enhanced community model  Is there capacity in the Glasgow area for Argyll and Bute patients  How much will thiscost And, of course, why throw the baby out with the bath water "},{"url":null,"title":"science matters to rewild or not to rewild that is the question","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsViewed from a plane, rural Britain consists predominantly of bare hills in the north and a southern patchwork of fields.The northern landscape is mainly determined by excessive grazing by sheep and deer, while dairy, meat and arable farming have shaped the south. So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings.

member for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale has resorted to Freedom of Information requests in a bid to get answers.A row erupted last month between the Conservative-led administration at Scottish Borders Council and the SNP government at Holyrood over funding for a replacement school.Claims by council leader Shona Haslam and education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton that the Scottish Government had rejected a plea for help was angrily refuted by both Ms Grahame and the Cabinet Secretary for Education, John Swinney.It emerged that no formal request for financial assistance had been made to the Scottish Government ahead of the claims being made.And it was several days later that Councillor Haslam eventually sent a letter - not in her role as council leader but as a ward councillor for Tweeddale East.Details of funding for a replacement Peebles High have remained sketchy with pound million being required to plug the gap between an expected pound million insurance pay out and the estimated demolition and rebuild costs of around pound million.Over the past few weeks Christine Grahames attempts for further clarication over funding from the council leader has been met with the cold shoulder.Ms Grahame told us: \"I have asked a number of follow-up questions to establish how plans for Peebles High would be progressing, however Councillor Haslam has now responded to say that she is not prepared to answer my questions.\"At the heart of this is the question of getting a proper replacement for Peebles High School that serves the school community properly.\"The issue should never have been made party political and I remain hugely frustrated that Councillor Haslam decided to issue a press release attacking the Scottish Government on February , apparently before any request was even made.\"How does trying to score cheap points against the SNP with a factually inaccurate press release serve the school community or indeed foster a co-operative approach between the council and the government \"It is behaviour that, frankly, should be beneath a council leader.\"Although Scottish Borders Council claim their decision to impose a record hike in council tax from next month is to help fund a new replacement school in Peebles, it is expected that money will still be required from Holyrood.But government officials have yet to receive any request from Newtown St Boswells.Ms Grahame added: \"As Irsquom sure Councillor Haslam well knows, her letter of February , issued after she claimed the Scottish Government had refused funding, does not constitute a formal

Four years later, she married her half-cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and in June  they had a son, James.In , her second husband was murdered.

She sought the help of Queen Elizabeth I of England, but Elizabeth thought she was a threat to her own throne and she imprisoned Mary in a series of English castles and manor houses.In , after more than nineteen years in custody, Mary was beheaded for plotting to assassinate Elizabeth.What will you see The house sits in attractive gardens which are home to some of Jedburghrsquos famous pear trees, descendants of the original pear trees planted around Jedburgh Abbey in the early s.Inside the towerhouse, a display of paintings, artefacts, and textiles associated with Mary explores not only her le and times, but the cult that has grown up around her.The period feel inside the house has been preserved with thoughtful design, which allows the story of Maryrsquos le to be told in an engaging way.The Rogues Gallery introduces the iniduals in the drama of Maryrsquos le, while the Last Letter Room reveals her final thoughts before her execution.VisitingThe museum is situated on Queen Street, near Canongate car park, where parking is free.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

They are extremely traumatised by their experiences and need a range of support.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, called for more to be done by the Home Office to meet the costs of supporting refugees. He said that leaving local authorities to pick up the bill could create ision in communities.Mr Innes said: ldquoIt creates a sense of animosity between people native to the area and people coming in who seem to be benefiting at their expense.And he highlighted the local authorityrsquos history of providing homes for refugees, both as part of the recent Syrian re-homing programme and previous projects to home Bosnian refugees.He said: ldquoWe have a proud history of stepping up to the mark when called on to do so in East Lothian.ldquoThese people come with huge trauma and it is important they are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.A Home Office spokesperson said it had increased payment for local authorities for all children regardless of their age to pound and the UK had provided protection for more than , vulnerable children since .They said: ldquoThe UK has a proud history of welcoming and supporting those in need of our protection, and we are grateful to local authorities across the country who are supporting vulnerable young asylum seekers.ldquoThe Home Office provides a contribution to the costs incurred by local authorities in looking after unaccompanied asylum-seeking childrenand former UASC care leavers. In May , we announced a signicant increase in the funding of their UASC support costs.East Lothian Council has provided homes for about  families ndash  refugees ndash from Syria since pledging to support up to seven families a year as part of a UK-wide scheme introduced five years ago.In the early s, the local authority helped resettle Bosnian refugees in the county, as well as Kosovan refugees later that decade.The cabinet was asked to support the local authority being part of a new global resettlement scheme which is being launched by the UK Government to replace the scheme next month and will widen the areas where refugees can come from.Members of the cabinet gave the move their backing."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-everyone-not-anyone","story":"IT WAS a beautul apple tree. Every year, as the summer faded into autumn, it gave its gt of apples to anyone who happened to pass. Children from the local village who were always hungry would sit under it and eat ripe apples until they had tummy ache. Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

would ask you to institute a pause to EU UK negotiations for at least six months.ldquoIt would seem impossible for business and others to cope with the enormous challenge ofCoronavirus while at the same time preparing for a completely new relationship with the EU in nine monthsrsquo time.ldquoA pause is also necessary given the inevitable lack of parliamentary and public scrutiny of the negotiations and their progress over that period, when all attention and effort will be focused on our collective actions to tackle and defeat the Coronavirus.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoThis is very welcome news and will come as a relief to workers and businesses alike.ldquoSince the scale of this outbreak became clear, itrsquos been necessary for all governments and political parties to work together.ldquoThis announcement from Mike Russell is very much in keeping with that spirit.ldquoNow we can really dedicate all our efforts to enduring this crisis, supporting those who will be worst hit, and ensure we can come out the other side looking forward to a bright future.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoI commended the SNP Brexit Secretary in Parliament for a very sensible decision in the face of this overwhelming crisis.\"I know how much this means to the SNP so it must be dficult to put their ambitions on hold. ldquoWe will have the debate on the merits of keeping our country together at another time, but we must put all these dferences aside whilst we beat this threat to our lives and way of le.\"I echo the Scottish Governmentrsquos call for the Brexit process to be delayed too. It would be sensible to put all our energies to working together across Europe and the world.A Scottish Greens spokesperson said: ldquoIt is right that the Scottish Government prioritises its resources to deal with the public health crisis that we all face.ldquoThe way we live our lives has changed and will continue to be dramatically impacted over the coming months.ldquoClearly this unprecedented situation will demand all the attention of the Scottish and UK governments, and many important issues from independence to Brexit will not be progressed for the time being.Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray added: ldquoThis is the right decision by the SNP government, but it should never have devoted resources to an unwanted second independence referendum in the first place. This is no time for constitutional politics.ldquoNot only should there be no second independence referendum, the Brexit timeline should also be extended.ldquoIt was already virtually impossible to secure a deal that protects businesses and workers, and now there is zero chance of securing that before the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 10 most popular dog breeds in the uk","story":"Research conducted by Dogfriendlycottages found that these are the  most popular dog breeds in the UK - do you agree .

NHS Orkney and the Scottish Government have previously indicated, however, that local testing figures will not be released — unless a positive result is confirmed.A statement released by the Scottish Government today announced that the programme of testing for coronavirus will be extended to GP practices, covering up to . million people across all health boards in Scotland.Folk presenting at practices with relevant symptoms, including with flu-like symptoms or general respiratory illness and underlying health conditions will be tested. The programme will also support the continued testing of people admitted to hospital with symptoms. However, those following the guidance to stay at home for seven daysthey have mild symptoms of a new cough or raised temperature will not be routinely tested – and will continue to be advised to only phone NHS  or contact the GPtheir condition worsens.NHS Orkney announced yesterday that, GP practices in Orkney will be changing the way they offer and book appointments to reduce the number of patients attending face to face appointments when they do not need to be examined, from Monday, March . If your GP Practice has previously offered the ability to book appointments online this will stop with immediate effect.In a statement on social media, the health authority explained: #If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-you should self-isolate for  days avoiding contact with other people wherever possible. If after  days or you continue to feel unwell and may need to see a GP, please call and speak to your GP practice.#Prior to an appointment being made a member of your GP Practice may call you to clary whether you have symptoms of COVID-. Following an initial conversation your GP Practice will advise on the most appropriate course of action.#To support in delaying the spread of COVID- we ask that you do NOT attend your GP Practice unless you have been asked to do so.#All appointment requests, repeat prescription requests and general enquiries should be made by calling your GP Practice.#If you already have an appointment booked, your Practice will be in contact with youthey need to change your appointment.#If you are currently being visited by our Community Nursing team you may be contacted to check there is no one in your household showing symptoms of COVID-.#The government believes that surveillance testing will provide real-time information on how the virus is spreading in Scotland, which will inform NHS planning and allow resources to be directed where they are needed most. It has confirmed that key workers such as NHS staff will continue to be testedthey show symptoms.Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood said: “This new approach to testing will enable us to understand the pattern and spread of coronavirus in the community, to develop a clear assessment of the situation and to predict the peak number of cases, without having to test everyone with possible symptoms.“Those with mild symptoms do not need to be tested. They should continue to stay at home for seven days and only contact their GP or their condition worsens.“Everybody has a role to play in helping contain this outbreak by following the latest health advice and basic hygiene precautions such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That means we will continue to plan and prepare for the weeks ahead, working closely with our NHS partners and following national guidance on public health.“Our aim is to ensure the resilience measures we have in place best meet the needs of our local community and minimise disruption as far as possible to the services we provide.#There has been widespread concern regarding visiting cruise ships and the OIC has faced criticism for not shutting its ports.Council leader James Stockan moved to reassure the Orkney public.He said: “Elected members met our senior management team to review the extensive steps already taken to prepare for the likely impact on Orkney of the coronavirus pandemic.#I believe the organisation is well prepared to respond effectively to what is a fast-changing situation.“I am aware there is concern in our community about visits to Orkney by cruise ships. No other port in Scotland has stopped such visits and we are following national guidance on this.“We have had port health procedures in place for many years for dealing with cases of infection aboard ships of all kind. These procedures are aimed at preventing infection coming into the country.”All cruise ships have been asked to provide a maritime declaration of health before visiting Orkney, whether or not they have any illness on board.Cruise companies are already well underway with cancelling voyages.The council saysthere was a suspected case of Covid- aboard a ship, the council’s port health and NHS Orkney’s public health teams would work in conjunction with Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Government to decide on the best course of action to take.If a situation of this kind arose, the most likely outcome is that the ship would be redirected to a port on the Scottish Mainland close to more specialist health facilities, OIC adds.Councillor Stockan added: “Although there has been a focus on cruise ships, people do of course travel to and from Orkney by other means — and that makes it very dficult to prevent the spread of the virus into the county.#This makes it all the more important that we as a council — and our wider community — do all that we can to reduce the potential impact on us all.”To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and to protect local communities as far as is practicable, OIC is only allowing travel by staff and elected members to meetings and training events on the Scottish Mainland in exceptional circumstances.In Orkney, councillors and staff will not be attending community council and other public meetings.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renewed calls to shut schools","story":"THERE have been renewed calls to shut schools in the north to combat the spread of the coronavirus.Ten special schools closed indefinitely from today .

Its job is to keep you safe from nasty germs that might infect you and most of the time it does a great job. This is why pc of people will fight this virus with minor symptoms.But sometimes your immune system isn#t up to the job. This can be because you become infected with a massive dose of a virus, which runs amok and makes you feel awful. Or perhaps you are over  and, like most things in your body, your immune system is less able. Or you might be taking drugs that suppress your immune systemyou have an inflammatory disease. Oryour heart or lungs are weak, the virus can really harm you. So the question is, is there anything you can do to boost your immune system  The answer is a resounding yes.Look after your immune systemTo know how to take care of your immune system, first you need to understand the weapons your immune system has, which are actually very impressive. When you come into contact with a germ you#ve never met before you#ve got ious barriers to try to stop it getting into your body. As well as skin, you have mucus - snot is a really important barrier as it traps germs and has special biochemicals that can kill them, in this case mainly bacteria. Your body is also actually covered in bacteria, inside and out , and many of these are beneficial. They out-compete the bad guys and even make chemicals to poison them. This stops the invader from eating the resident bacterias# lunch.The germs can sometimes win, however. They have cunning tricks up their sleeves to breach the defences. A virus like SARS-CoV burrows inside the cells that line your lungs. That#s where they multiply. However, pretty soon the rapid response unit of your immune system will arrive. Special white blood cells can attack the invader. So-called macrophageseat the germs up and destroy them. They also call the alarm to bring out another white blood cell called a T lymphocyte. These are like police superintendents, controlling everything and even killing off the virally-infected cell themselves to stop the virus spreading. It#s the T lymphocytes that remember, so that when you get reinfected they are good to go. T lymphocytes are an important aspect of why vaccines work. They also control another important white blood cell, the B lymphocyte. This is the cell that makes antibodies. These are very specic proteins that are great at stopping a virus like SARS-CoV in its tracks and B lymphocytes also remember.We remain optimistic that there will be a vaccine soon. Vaccines are weakened forms of a germ or part of it, which causes a weak immune response. But the cells of the immune system are now trained. And when the intruder comes they kill it. It#s a bit like the sherf has put up wanted posters around town and when the bad guy turns up he#s recognised and killed quickly and you won#t even know you#ve been infected. This is why it#s so important to get a vaccine for Covid-.What can you do The trick is to keep all these cells of your immune system fit and healthy. This begins with what you eat. A ied diet with lots of high-fibre foods really boosts your immune system - immune cells love healthy food and hate fatty foods, so a healthy diet is essential.Also,you don#t over-eat and have good gaps between meals, this really mobilises the immune system increasing the numbers of immune cells by as much as three-fold, so lay off that second piece of pie and have gaps of at least four hours between meals. Don#t over-do this, though, as being malnourished has a hugely negative effect, as can be seen in developing countries where it#s a huge cause of death from diseases like TB.Do probiotic drinks work The evidence for taking probiotic supplements is mixed. It#s much more effective to change your diet to a healthier one.And what about vitamins Vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. It is used by our immune cells, and is something that people across the island of Ireland can get quite low on in the winter. So it#s good to take in more of it. Taking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for those who are well-fed. Eating your five-a-day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels. It#s water soluble so you will just pass any excess into your urine.Stay activeTo be immunologically fit, you also need to be physically fit. White blood cells can be quite sluggish. Exercise mobilises them by increasing blood flow in your body, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy all over your body. Adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least  minutes a week of moderate aerobic activityor  minutes of vigorous activity . Either suffice.The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. Anything#s better than nothing. But a letime#s exercise could signicantly stop your immune system declining with age. In , a study found that  non-smoking amateur cyclists aged  to  still had the immune systems of young people.Like eating, you can overdo it though. You can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system. Elite athletes are more prone to infections. So don#t overdo it. As ever, moderation is the key.Stay calmOne of the many effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can decrease immune , a common example of which is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. During periods of stress, it can reactivate again and you get shingles. And we all know that stress makes us more susceptible to colds and flus. Worrying about Covid- might actually make you more susceptible to it.What about alcohol Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis though, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. This is one reason why alcoholics are more prone to infections. So the hot whiskey might make you feel better for a short time but it might also slow down recovery.Sleep wellExercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to infection. A study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of immune cells. If you#ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything#s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you#ve got problems.So the bottom line is a good night#s sleep, combating stress, a balanced diet, and moderate exercise are all great at boosting your immune system, in the never-ending battle between us and the germs that infect us, and that includes the latest bundle of evil, SARS-CoV.

But yesterday there were dozens of comments on Twitter in response to the advertisement, including from Sinn Fein Senator Niall O Donnghaile who said: Delete your account.Other comments included a post from a user called Steve saying: You guys have got this so wrong.

This will mean businesses will not have to pay any rates for the next three months.In order to help businesses with short-term cash flow problems, rates bills from April to June will also be deferred.There have been calls, however, for the rates holiday to be extended to a year, as is the case for the hospitality sector in England.Q What other support is available for businesses A Businesses will now be able to avail of £bn in government-back loans at low interest rates. These loans are designed to help firms pay rent, salaries, stock and suppliers.The loan scheme has not been welcomed by all, however. Bill Wolsey, managing director of the Beannchor Group, which has temporarily laid off  staff and closed the majority of its pubs and hotels, said putting businesses into further debt is not the answer.Q The Chancellor also announced funding grants of up to £, for small businesses, does this apply to Northern Ireland A It is currently unclear whether this will apply to Northern Ireland. Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said there needs to be urgent clarity from the Chancellor on this issue.Q Are any other financial measures expected to be announced in the near future A While the latest financial package will alleviate some of concerns of businesses, many have said it does not go far enough.There are several concerns which it did not address, including whether VAT bills for small businesses due in April will be deferred. Business leaders have also called on employer#s national insurance contributions to be waived, while those self-employed are also facing a tax payment in July.In the coming weeks calls for action on issues such as these are expected to intensy.If you rely on benefits or are struggling financially due to the coronavirus, here#s what has already been announced to help you.Q How can I sign on for benefits during the pandemic A Communities minister Deirdre Hargey has announced that all benefits offices will be closed and contact will be made over the phone to protect the public and frontline staff. All front line services will be suspended initially for a period of three months to assess where we are with this virus and any contact will be done via the telephone or other forms of communications, she said, speaking on BBC Radio Ulster. Appointments have been postponed for a period of three months, which may be extended. Q Do I still have to sign on in person A Ms Hargey said that those who normally have to sign on in person for benefits will no longer have to turn up to the benefit offices. No one will be penalised for any attending the office, she said, adding that those who usually have to submit medical advice or certicates in person are not currently required to do so. Q Will I be contacted about my face-to-face interview A We#re contacting those people over the next few days to let them know their appointments have been suspended initially for a period of three months. We will be constantly reviewing that, said Ms Hargey.  Q Is there any other support available A The Communities Minister said she will address discretionary support payment legislation over the next few days. These are payments for those who are on a wage from April  of under £,, low income families who are fallen on hard times - that they can come and apply for a grant for things like household costs, food bills, heating costs, she said. Ms Hargey said she is also moving on issues such as statutory sick pay and universal credit. Those workers who happen to lose their jobs here who are on contracts or who are self-employed can now come forward to claim those benefits and get that additional support, she said. Q I am on the Steps  Success employment programme - do I have to attend A Ms Hargey said: All programmes going forward will be suspended for a period and people will not be penalised for not attending the office.Q I work in a small business - what will my job prospects look like in the near future A Speaking in Stormont on Monday, Mrs Dodds revealed plans to re-ert laid-off staff in the coming months.I think it is something that my department will quickly look at,we are in the position where firms have to close, she said. Many people will have skills in food preparation that we may need in our hospitals and so on as this thing reaches a peak, so we will be looking at this and how,one business closes, there are opportunities in other areas.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus fact check: From masks to mortality rates - how to separate fact from fictionThe coronavirus crisis has become a breeding ground for myths and conspiracies - how do we separate fact from fiction \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHow former army trauma surgeon Michael Ryan from Ireland is leading global fight against coronavirusDr Michael Ryan was at home in his kitchen in Galway one day, and his phone rang, the caller identied himself as Bill Gates.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadTyrone man who openly admitted beating his children jailedCoronavirus: Church of Ireland suspend services until further noticeCoronavirus QA: What support is available for business in Northern Ireland Libraries NI increases monitoring after girl sees user watch pornBelfast firm#s innovative thermometer creates global rush for orders during coronavirus crisis,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rt Rev’d Andrew Forster, Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, said the church, like all of society, had a duty to do what they can to ‘protect people’s lives and minimise suffering’. He said: “I am announcing the suspension of all public acts of worship in the United Dioceses of Derry and Raphoe. This includes Sunday services and regular midweek services. “Baptisms, weddings and funerals will still be permitted as long as they comply with the guidance of the appropriate public health authority. The bishop said churches would remain open at service times for those who wish to pray privately and stressed that that pastoral support was still available. googletag.cmd.push “Our church buildings will be open at service times for those who wish to pray privately. “Clergy who are well enough will ensure that they are available to parishioners for pastoral support –necessary by telephone or online. “We are also investigating options for non-traditional forms of worship, such as radio and online religious services.” Rev’d Forster also encouraged parishioners to continue to look out for one another and ensure that anyone who is struggling as a result of the crisis receives the support they need. He said: “In the midst of crisis, we have an opportunity to show what real Christian community is all about. googletag.cmd.push “Stay in touch with one another.Keep an eye on your neighbours, especially those who are older, those who are more vulnerable and those who are lonely. “Look after them. Don’t do anything that puts their health at risk. Make sure they’re okay. “Some in our Church family and in the wider community will be experiencing financial hardship. “Be generous. Give to charities. Support local foodbanks. Let us show what real community is all about.” The Bishop expressed his regret at having to take these measures in the face of what he described as a ‘rapidly changing situation’. He said: “We, at diocesan level, will be in regular communication with parishioners. “No bishop wants to suspend services – especially not a Church of Ireland bishop on the Feast Day of St Patrick. But it is done for the right reasons and with people’s best interests at heart.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hopefully it’s foolproof, but everyone’s dialect would be dferent.”“I’d love to do another one for a Key Stage  reading scheme. What we want to do is provide it to areas that want it. There were only , books printed, so we’re tied a bit in that regard.”Gloacuter na Speiriacuteniacute had mooted the idea a few years previously but were unable to proceed as they weren’t able to secure the funding. Conchuacuter thinks the revamped scheme will encourage parents to get involved in their child’s reading and take away any reluctance that may exist.He said: “We put phonetics underneath the Irish transcript so a person who has now Irish at all can read to their children at night. “It’s a way of supporting the child and feeling part of their education and that was basically the idea behind it.“It’s giving parents a bit of encouragement to read to their child and raise their interest in reading. “They might be timid at the start but by the time they get through all nine books they’ll be flying at the end of it!”With children experiencing increased amounts of screen time, Conchuacuter hopes engaging parents in reading to their children will help them wind down at night and strengthen the parental bond.He said: “I think it will have a positive impact because when you look at the way technology is advancing, a lot of children are going to bed with phones and iPads.“Their brains are active all the time with these devices.“This way, you can put all that technology away for a while and the parent can go in and read to their child at night.“It’s bound to have a positive impact, not alone on the child but also in strengthening the bond between parent and child.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As part of the high level plans for the City of Culture yearthere were three high levels objectives of what we wanted to be. To be an Active City. To be an Age Friendly City. To be an Early Intervention CitySub groups were created for each of these high level objectives. Back then I believed, and still do believe, that we should make it as easy as possible for people to take part in all types of activities regardless of their ability or age. Basically something for everyone.At one of the meetings around Easter time, I noticed a girl in the sub group meeting who was so bubbly, friendly, chatty and was dishing out wee chocolate Easter bunnies to everyone.I was like “Oh shes interesting, I must keep an eye on her”. Turns out this lady was Jenner Neff Anyway long story short, we got on like a house on fire in the meeting and had so many common interests, concerns and passions around doing everything we can to halt health inequalities and supporting those that need the help most in our communities. The tipping point came when she professed her love for diagrams to tell a story to get a message across rather than using a whole load of wordy paragraphs, when the diagram could tell the story much better with the bonus in that it was easier for people to digest and understand.I always say it was a match made in heaven through our love of diagrams.Jenner and I got chatting and we were both really frustrated that despite there being loads of brilliant community programmes happening on peoples doorsteps, a lot of the time they were not remotely aware.We knew that people needed more support to attend and engage in these activities - it’s not enough to hand someone a phone number and expect them to go along.And from the health commissioners’ side of the things, we could see money being spent on dferent initiatives in dferent areas, but with no analytics about outcomes, engagement, gaps in service provision or health risk hotspots.They needed a better understanding of what was available and what was to inform their commissioning and recommissioning decisions.We both decided that we wanted to do something together to better connect up our communities and thought technology could play a massive part, acting as the middlewomen man to do this and place the person at the centre - to give them the best chance at le. We didnt realise at the time what we were talking about was social prescribing and we laugh now when we talk about as we thought we invented social prescribing. When we did our research we quickly found out that social prescribing had been around for years and when you scratch the surface of social prescribing its basically the community development approach to health improvement that we have all been doing for over  years. However we also quickly recognised that the missing piece of the puzzle was digital, to help enhance social prescribing and allow it to be scaled across communities, towns and cities. So as I said, it was  and there were lots of new things happening across the city and there was a big push for all things digital, innovative and ‘just going for it’ and giving these innovations a try.A competition was announced called the TMED health challenge which was inviting people from across Derry to pitch their ideas in a Dragons Den five-minute style format. We had practiced our pitch for two minutes and planned to show a video for three minutes.Showtime for the video came, and the speakers didn’t work. Let’s just say we didnt have a good experience in the pitch and we didnt win the pound prize.However as luck would have it, the winnerasked to meet us for coffee the following week.When we met up he said: “I love what youre trying to do, and so much so, I am going to donate my prize money to you.”So we got his pound prize money and three months of incubation space at C-TRIC.We were off the starting blocks, and Elemental was born.So you could say the start of Elemental was really down to the generosity of Maurice and the fact that he got social prescribing.From a business point of view Elemental is going from strength to strength, we are the market leaders for digital social prescribing across the UK and Ireland and our customers numbers are growing month on month, working with over  social prescribing projects and with , GPs using Elemental to refer their patients to community based activities.The great thing is that our base is firmly and always will be in Derry with the majority of our  employees based in the city.As it happens we are currently recruiting a Senior Developer.If interested get in touch www.elementalsoftware.co googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

And meant it. Surely big Ron Atkinson put it best when he offered: “I never comment on referees and I’m not going to break the habit of a letime for that prat.”The men in black - universally castigated for their myopia, shunned for poor decision-making, and all too often the painted the perennial pantomime villains. Undeniably society’s last great unprotected minority, perhaps it’s time to redress the balance, to pay tribute to the unloved whistler.Storm Dennis, Storm Ciara and their exotic cousin Storm Jorge – that unholy Trinity of recent unwelcome weather phenomena, wreaked havoc on the recent sporting scene, and threatened to carpet bomb the entire sporting calendar.But across this great sports loving city, from Judges Road to Celtic Park our bold referees collectively drew back the curtains on teeth-chatteringly cold weekends. The show must go on, and the much maligned referees were the benevolent ringmasters. googletag.cmd.push MotivationLocal football referee Dennis O’Connor paints a picture of what would motivate an apparently sane looking man to take up this God-forsaken hobby.“It’s addictive,” enthuses O’Connor. “When you first start you can’t get enough of it!“I’ve always enjoyed refereeing Saturday mornings. It’s more local and I enjoy meeting the players. You run into them up the town and you talk about the game, have a laugh. It’s a social thing really.”Originally from Kent, the love of a local woman brought him to these shores in  where he played for BBOB and Foyle Wanderers.And like all sportsmen, father time eventually tapped his wicked finger on the shoulder and the time arrived for O’Connor to call it a day.“I wasn’t enjoying football anymore you worry about injuries as you get older. And I thought I’ll give refereeing a go.“The first game I reffed was a DuPont game and I loved it straight away,” says the Englishman with a straight face. “I don’t know what it is but I’ve always loved the Saturday Morning League. You really look forward to the weekend.”Boasting six dferent referee kits these days, the modern refereeing wardrobe is as colourful as some of the language O’Connor would endure at a Tamnaherin Celtic match. While watching games on television is very much a bus man’s holiday for the affable  year old whistler. “You’re watching the referee all the time you’re even watching the linesman. I find myself calling ‘Offside!’ during games like a lunatic.” googletag.cmd.push PreferenceGreysteel man Sean Curran officiates all codes in GAA and soccer, but has a strong preference. “I love Gaelic games,” he states. “I find the soccer to be a bit boring to be honest. Underage soccer is better because of the level of skill these days, it’s a joy to referee. But definitely Gaelic Games is my first choice.”Do referees need a thick skin  “Very! You have to be a certain type of person. You have to be strong mentally. You have to be able to deflect all the flack you can get.”  PICTURED: Local referee John Crossan. The  year old shares Dennis O’Connor’s passion for the officiating trade. “I love it,” he says. “It’s a passion I have. I started out just doing it for my club but then I wanted to do bigger and bigger games. And I wanted to improve my own standards. I’ve refereed over  matches now and I’ve enjoyed every one of them.”Hurling referee Mark O’Neill agrees with Curran that a hide like a rhinosaurus is crucial to succeed in the refereeing game.“%!” he laughs. “Look, I gave it to referees all my le. I argued with referees over most decisions, and I suppose this is now karma coming back at me. As a referee you have to take the higher ground. In the first five seconds after an incident you have to give the player a bit of time to digest a decision he or she may strongly agree with.“In GAA you can move the ball on  metres. You don’t have that in soccer. I find that really helps in GAA, as it turns it back on the player where their team-mates turn on themthe ball is moved forward.“Rugby has the same idea,” he continues, “but the respect rugby referees get is amazing. There’s nothing worse than slabbering, and the sin bingives the person ten minutes to simmer down.” ContrastingRugby referee Glenda Mellon cuts a very much contrasting figure on a Saturday afternoon. “I started  years ago after I stopped playing and coaching,” she explains. “It gave me a way of being involved in the sport I love without the bruises and pain on a Monday morning.”Finishing up her own stellar rugby career, Waterside woman faced the same dilemma as many of her refereeing compatriots. What next   PICTURED:Rugby referee Glenda Mellon “I really enjoy it as it gives me something to train for,” says the youthful  year old. “Its also competitiveyou want it to be. You want to improve your assessment scores and get moved up the levels to get better games.”But refereeing can prove to be a dficult balancing act too for the family woman. “The worst thing is the mummy we guilt of being away all day Saturday.“I enjoy the games most when the players have a bit of banter with me,” she continues. “But its usually quite funny when players forget whos reffing and call me ‘Sir’ during a game, and then get very embarrassed when they realise what they have said.”‘Fail to prepare, prepare to fail’ quoth the great Roy Keane, but he probably hadn’t anticipating this answer from Glenda Mellon on how she readies herself for a rugby match.“Fake tan, eyelashes and French plaits!” she chortles. Fair to say not the typical response you would hear from a referee, but a welcome addition in le’s rich tapestry.  PICTURED:Referee Mark McGarrigle gives a yellow card to Sion Mills player. As a potential hobby refereeing might appear as soul destroying as checking your bank balance after a big weekend. Apart from all the grief you endure from players and spectators alike, there’s not much glamour in changing your clothes in a small cattle shed, or in the back of a lorry container in Donemana – where a shower with warm water a dim and distant prospect.A sunken soggy pitch at Leafair, or a bracingly cold morning at Lisnagelvin where the wind would blow a traveller off his cousin – only the lion-hearted need apply to the reffing trade.It’s not for everyone. But to the small minority who take up the whistle, and remember we couldn’t play or watch sport without them, referees are an integral part of the game and we should salute them. And just like footballers, hurlers and rugby players across the country, the misery of a poor game can follow them around like a mangy dog.Playing the game tends to be a selfish act. ‘Love’, ‘passion’, ‘give something back’. These are the collective themes that knit together and resonate when you speak to referees about their motivations.Somebody once said being a rare boy is not a crime. Well neither is being a referee.  PICTURED:Former Derry City and Celtic star Niall McGinn with local referees, Marty Dunne, Dick Tucker and on right, Gerry Morrison.

And meant it. Surely big Ron Atkinson put it best when he offered: “I never comment on referees and I’m not going to break the habit of a letime for that prat.”The men in black - universally castigated for their myopia, shunned for poor decision-making, and all too often the painted the perennial pantomime villains. Undeniably society’s last great unprotected minority, perhaps it’s time to redress the balance, to pay tribute to the unloved whistler.Storm Dennis, Storm Ciara and their exotic cousin Storm Jorge – that unholy Trinity of recent unwelcome weather phenomena, wreaked havoc on the recent sporting scene, and threatened to carpet bomb the entire sporting calendar.But across this great sports loving city, from Judges Road to Celtic Park our bold referees collectively drew back the curtains on teeth-chatteringly cold weekends. The show must go on, and the much maligned referees were the benevolent ringmasters. googletag.cmd.push MotivationLocal football referee Dennis O’Connor paints a picture of what would motivate an apparently sane looking man to take up this God-forsaken hobby.“It’s addictive,” enthuses O’Connor. “When you first start you can’t get enough of it!“I’ve always enjoyed refereeing Saturday mornings. It’s more local and I enjoy meeting the players. You run into them up the town and you talk about the game, have a laugh. It’s a social thing really.”Originally from Kent, the love of a local woman brought him to these shores in  where he played for BBOB and Foyle Wanderers.And like all sportsmen, father time eventually tapped his wicked finger on the shoulder and the time arrived for O’Connor to call it a day.“I wasn’t enjoying football anymore you worry about injuries as you get older. And I thought I’ll give refereeing a go.“The first game I reffed was a DuPont game and I loved it straight away,” says the Englishman with a straight face. “I don’t know what it is but I’ve always loved the Saturday Morning League. You really look forward to the weekend.”Boasting six dferent referee kits these days, the modern refereeing wardrobe is as colourful as some of the language O’Connor would endure at a Tamnaherin Celtic match. While watching games on television is very much a bus man’s holiday for the affable  year old whistler. “You’re watching the referee all the time you’re even watching the linesman. I find myself calling ‘Offside!’ during games like a lunatic.” googletag.cmd.push PreferenceGreysteel man Sean Curran officiates all codes in GAA and soccer, but has a strong preference. “I love Gaelic games,” he states. “I find the soccer to be a bit boring to be honest. Underage soccer is better because of the level of skill these days, it’s a joy to referee. But definitely Gaelic Games is my first choice.”Do referees need a thick skin  “Very! You have to be a certain type of person. You have to be strong mentally. You have to be able to deflect all the flack you can get.”  PICTURED: Local referee John Crossan. The  year old shares Dennis O’Connor’s passion for the officiating trade. “I love it,” he says. “It’s a passion I have. I started out just doing it for my club but then I wanted to do bigger and bigger games. And I wanted to improve my own standards. I’ve refereed over  matches now and I’ve enjoyed every one of them.”Hurling referee Mark O’Neill agrees with Curran that a hide like a rhinosaurus is crucial to succeed in the refereeing game.“%!” he laughs. “Look, I gave it to referees all my le. I argued with referees over most decisions, and I suppose this is now karma coming back at me. As a referee you have to take the higher ground. In the first five seconds after an incident you have to give the player a bit of time to digest a decision he or she may strongly agree with.“In GAA you can move the ball on  metres. You don’t have that in soccer. I find that really helps in GAA, as it turns it back on the player where their team-mates turn on themthe ball is moved forward.“Rugby has the same idea,” he continues, “but the respect rugby referees get is amazing. There’s nothing worse than slabbering, and the sin bingives the person ten minutes to simmer down.” ContrastingRugby referee Glenda Mellon cuts a very much contrasting figure on a Saturday afternoon. “I started  years ago after I stopped playing and coaching,” she explains. “It gave me a way of being involved in the sport I love without the bruises and pain on a Monday morning.”Finishing up her own stellar rugby career, Waterside woman faced the same dilemma as many of her refereeing compatriots. What next   PICTURED:Rugby referee Glenda Mellon “I really enjoy it as it gives me something to train for,” says the youthful  year old. “Its also competitiveyou want it to be. You want to improve your assessment scores and get moved up the levels to get better games.”But refereeing can prove to be a dficult balancing act too for the family woman. “The worst thing is the mummy we guilt of being away all day Saturday.“I enjoy the games most when the players have a bit of banter with me,” she continues. “But its usually quite funny when players forget whos reffing and call me ‘Sir’ during a game, and then get very embarrassed when they realise what they have said.”‘Fail to prepare, prepare to fail’ quoth the great Roy Keane, but he probably hadn’t anticipating this answer from Glenda Mellon on how she readies herself for a rugby match.“Fake tan, eyelashes and French plaits!” she chortles. Fair to say not the typical response you would hear from a referee, but a welcome addition in le’s rich tapestry.  PICTURED:Referee Mark McGarrigle gives a yellow card to Sion Mills player. As a potential hobby refereeing might appear as soul destroying as checking your bank balance after a big weekend. Apart from all the grief you endure from players and spectators alike, there’s not much glamour in changing your clothes in a small cattle shed, or in the back of a lorry container in Donemana – where a shower with warm water a dim and distant prospect.A sunken soggy pitch at Leafair, or a bracingly cold morning at Lisnagelvin where the wind would blow a traveller off his cousin – only the lion-hearted need apply to the reffing trade.It’s not for everyone. But to the small minority who take up the whistle, and remember we couldn’t play or watch sport without them, referees are an integral part of the game and we should salute them. And just like footballers, hurlers and rugby players across the country, the misery of a poor game can follow them around like a mangy dog.Playing the game tends to be a selfish act. ‘Love’, ‘passion’, ‘give something back’. These are the collective themes that knit together and resonate when you speak to referees about their motivations.Somebody once said being a rare boy is not a crime. Well neither is being a referee.  PICTURED:Former Derry City and Celtic star Niall McGinn with local referees, Marty Dunne, Dick Tucker and on right, Gerry Morrison.

It was Magheras first year in the senior competition, after the school was formed seven years earlier. St Malachys Belfast were crowned as MacRory champions in the second game of the double header. Earlier in the season, Maghera ran them close in a challenge game earlier in the season. Managed by Sean Spud Murphy, the Derry men were back-boned by Laverty and Mickey Moran at midfield, stated ious press reports after the game. googletag.cmd.push Behind them, sat a solid half back line of Frankie McCotter, James Crilly and Kenny Bradley, whose second half covering was superb, and a forward line which displayed the ability to combine in their approach to scoring. Maghera were well drilled in the arts of the game. They knew when to hold the ball, when to pass and when to use the long delivery. Had the attack taken the point chances which came their way they could have doubled their final tally. Laverty elected to play with the wind at their backs and after hitting the first two points of the game, a defensive error allowed Omagh in for a goal. googletag.cmd.push Before the break, Maghera were back in the game with a goal that began in their defence. Frankie McCotter cleared a dangerous Omagh attack. Mickey Moran gained possession, who in turn passed to Fintan McCloskey. Pat ONeill took over and after drawing out the Omagh defence, he released Eugene Laverty. The Lavey man ran through in the clear before hammering to the back of the net past Tyrone senior teams reserve keeper Ciaran Harte. The goal helped Maghera go in at the break on level terms, - each. After the interval, skipper Laverty won the throw-in and after speeding up the wing, passed to Pat ONeill, who shot over the bar – giving Maghera into a lead they never lost. Liam Harbinson had a goal ruled out for square ball but made up for it shortly after for a neat finish. He was a noted soccer player and after dribbling the ball through the heart of the Omagh defence, he slotted past Harte. Fintan McCloskey and Brendan Kelly scored points for Maghera but Omagh hit back. After an error in the Maghera square, after Peter Finns long ball, Omagh dangerman Joe McGrade fired an unstoppable shot to the net. Only a goal separated the teams, - to -, but Fintan McCloskeys burst up the right wing relieved the pressure. Brendan Kelly pointed a free, followed by a Moran effort from long-range point eased the pressure before Lavertys point on the final whistle saw Maghera finish strongly.

Organisers of the race said they had made the decision because of the ongoing outbreak of Covid-. The races stopover in Derry was to be the centrepiece of the week-long Foyle Maritime Festival. If the race has been postponed, it seems unlikely that the festival will go ahead - another massive blow to the local economy as the impact of the coronavirus continues to hit all aspects of le. In a statement this morning, organisers of the Clipper Race said it was a very dficult decision. googletag.cmd.push With the ongoing global outbreak of Covid- and the enormous impact it has created on world travel, the Clipper - Race has been postponed with immediate effect. This decision has been in no way taken lightly. Our crew are currently under quarantine in Subic Bay, Philippines, where the Clipper Race fleet has been berthed since Sunday  March. The island of Luzonis currently under enhanced community quarantine. In addition, the fleet was due to race across the North Pacic Ocean from  March towards Seattle. However, with the city currently in a state of emergency and travel and medical insurance restrictions in the United States, we could not allow our teams to depart without a viable destination. googletag.cmd.push This, along with the growing global uncertainty on how the situation could develop in the coming months, meant postponing the race was the safest option for all involved. The organisers said theClipper - Race has three legs remaining. These race stages will now be postponed for approximately ten months, when the remaining circumnavigation will be completed. Thisof postponement allows for us to avoid adverse weather patterns on the remainder of our global route. All Leg ,  and  crew, along with our circumnavigators, will be able to rejoin the race when it resumes next year. This postponement will have an impact on the timing of future races. The next full edition of the Clipper Race will start in the summer of . More details on this will be confirmed at a later date. We are extremely disappointed to postpone the remainder of the Clipper - Race. We are proud of all of our intrepid crew for having competed in this race edition since it departed London and look forward to welcoming all of our upcoming crew next year when the race continues. We are also grateful to all of our crew, supporters and Race Partners for their continued support.

With her fresh complexion, sparkling eyes and ready smile, few would believe that Mrs Jean Kelly is  years old.Secretly enjoying the fuss, Jean appeared happy to be sipping tea from a bone china teacup and saucer at her birthday party, which was attended by family, friends and staff members.While Jean grew up in the Roaring Twenties, it wasnrsquot all flappers and jazz bands around Lisowen mdash the townland outside Saintfield which was her home.Born Jean Stewart, she lived with her grandparents and attended Doranrsquos Rock National School, a small two-room country school between Saintfield and Crossgar.When she left school she went to work at the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch, which was owned by the aristocratic Clanwilliam family.Youngest son Malcolm takes up her story.He said: ldquoIt wasnrsquot long after she began working there when one fine evening she was pushing her bike along the Creevyargon Road toward home, exhausted after a dayrsquos work when she met a young man walking toward her in the other direction.Malcolm explained the young man was so taken by Jean that he offered to push the bike for her.ldquoThe young man was my father, Hugh, and within three years they were married, said Malcolm.Hughrsquos family were dairy farmers from the Creevyargon Road. When the couple got married Jean gave up her job at Montalto, as was customary in those days.Jean and Hugh were to be blessed with six children, three of whom mdash Malcolm and his elder sisters, Irene and Anne mdash are still alive. Two of the children died in infancy and another daughter, Margaret, passed away a few years ago.Jean has been a widow for over  years but her fabulous tapestries and hours spent volunteering at local charity shops are testimony to someone who enjoys being busy. One of her finely embroidered pieces hangs proudly in the nursesrsquo station at Spa Nursing Home.Some years ago, Jean visited northern France and sewed the magnicent medieval monastery of Mont-St-Michel, set in the bay of St Malo where Normandy and Brittany merge.She is also a keen local historian and is particularly knowledgable about Betsy Gray and the Battle of Ballynahinch in .Jean also enjoys John Wayne films, including Rio Bravo and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and the musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers which starred Howard Keel. She is also a great fan of country music legend Jim Reeves.Jean has been a resident at Spa Nursing Home for almost four years and son Malcolm says she could not he happier. ldquoThe staff are very good to her, he remarked..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call for investment in Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted at a meeting at Stormont last week.Fisheries minister Edwin Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the port, including deepening the harbour to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.The local politicians highlighted the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure and called for the port to receive its fair share of funding to enhance the fleet.Mr McGrath described Ardglass as a ldquostrategically important harbour for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish.The MLA said further investment was ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided to allow larger vessels to dock safely.ldquoSuch work should be undertaken in concert with efforts to expand Kilkeel harbour and ensure that our local fishing fleet is enhanced ahead of Brexit, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSouth Down has a proud association with the fishing industry. It is beyond time that we invested in this important part of our economy, creating new jobs and bringing new opportunities to local people.Cllr Curran mdash who invited Mr Poots to visit Ardglass to see the port at first hand mdash said such a visit would provide an opportunity for the fisheries minister to see that the development of the harbour is ldquoessential for the day-to-day lives of people in the village and the economic prosperity of South Down.He said that the local port is home to a large fishing fleet which lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland. In addition, Cllr Curran explained that Ardglass is the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor.ldquoThe main economic activity in Ardglass is the fishing industry and although it is reasonable buoyant at present, harbour improvement is needed to sustain it., Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThis improvement is required to facilitate the large fish and prawn boats as they have encountered issues with access.Cllr Curran explained that due to their size, a number of vessels have scraped along the sea bed at low tides entering the harbour, causing damage to their hulls which can result in vessels being out of commission for repairs. leading to a loss of earnings.ldquoSome of the larger boats now bypass Ardglass and go where, mainly to Belfast, he continued. ldquoThis results in a loss of landings and additional transport costs to the local fish factories.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIf Ardglass harbour is not deepened, it could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the fishing industry in Ardglass and that is something no one wants to see happening.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is supporting plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour to help secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry and has provided financial support to a harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals.The money was designed to help the group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is also keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Coronavirus.jpg","title":"Coronavirus: St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEXT Tuesdayrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick has been cancelled over the coronavirus threat.Itrsquos only the second time the cross-community carnival has been halted since it was started in the s mdash it was called off in  due to the foot and mouth health crisis.Newry, Mourne and Down Council yesterday confirmed that parades would not go ahead in Downpatrick or Newry after party leaders on the council decided to pull the plug.The council has also cancelled open-air activities in St Patrickrsquos Square, but other events in Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre are going ahead.Chief executive Marie Ward spoke yesterday morning with the DUPrsquos Billy Walker, Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke, UUPrsquos David Taylor and the SDLPrsquos Pete Byrne for their views after Belfast City Council voted to cancel its parade on Monday night.Dublin also cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, the largest event held on the island.A council spokesperson said the decision was made ldquoin consultation with party leaders and is in line with the recent cancellations of St Patrickrsquos Day parades where.The spokesperson added: ldquoThe council appreciates the negative impact this decision may have on local businesses at this time, however this decision has been taken as a precaution given our membersrsquo and the publicrsquos concern around the coronavirus response.The townrsquos religious ceremonies are to go ahead as planned.A service of Holy Communion in St Patrickrsquos Church of Ireland Church at Saul will be held at .am.The traditional mass in Irish and the distribution of shamrock will take place in St Patrickrsquos Church at am and the cross-community service will take place in Down Cathedral at .am.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said while he understood peoplersquos concerns, he pointed out that Patrickrsquos Day was also a religious festival and that services would be taking place as normal.ldquoPart of our theme this year is prayer for the country which is very apt at this time, he added.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke was the first politician to call for the event to be cancelled.The Sinn Feacutein man said it was ldquoessential to have an all Ireland response to this epidemic, which is spreading rapidly across Europe.He said: ldquoI believe there is an obligation on myself and all councillors to protect the health and well-being of citizens, given the spread of coronavirus and growing concern amongst the public.He said that the decision was not taken lightly but it was ldquothe responsible thing to do.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an event held at a later dateit is possible, to reschedule these celebrations, as sections of the business community will undoubtedly see a reduction in business, and the British government need to provide resources to mitigate these losses.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker said he felt that there would have been an increased risk to Downpatrickthe parade had have gone ahead as it could have attracted people who normally attended the Belfast event.ldquoWe may have had the situation that we would have increased crowds with increased risk, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI think itrsquos the right decision to take.

discover whether the bid has been successful.The funding secured to date has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fundand Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs .Since the s, the sprawling forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important -hectare arboretum.The proposed development project aims to create a new vision for the historic Castlewellan demesne, delivering what is being described as a ldquoheritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.Council officials and local politicians are keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.Officials say the focus is on improving amenities and the interpretation of the parkrsquos natural and built heritage.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the walled garden area designed to provide access via a lt to its upper floor, with the council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.At Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, it was

can now prepare for a massive derby clash with Celtic Bhoys.First half goals from twin terrors Daniel Taggart and Declan Dowie sent Ballynagross on their way and Eoin Rooney smashed in an unstoppable third midway through the second half to finally kill off a game Strangford side.In a competitive opening, Ballynagross used the width of the pitch to get at Strangford and with just two minutes gone Dowie had an effort cleared off the line after a cross from Rooney threatened to cause damage.Five minutes later Rooney had an effort hacked away to safety by an alert Conan Hynds as Ballynagross threatened to run riot.However, Donnie Ritchie started to get a few tackles in and his physicality in the engine room enabled Strangford to mount a few attacks of their own, using Conall Magee and Eoin King as willing outlets.Darting runs from Hynds and Ritchiersquos no-nonsense approach was just the ticket for Strangford and with  minutes gone Patrick Kerr had the ball in the back of the net only for it to be harshly ruled out for offside.Two minutes later at the opposite end, Cultra again saved from Rooney and followed that up with another good stop to deny Dowie.Strangford were becoming increasingly confident as teenage defenders Fionn McFaul and Thomas Fitzsimons settled into the job and with Ritchie and Hynds rattling a few cages, Niall Hyndsrsquo side started to look the part.However, they were left crestfallen in the th minute when Dowie broke free on the right and crossed for Taggart to flash a ing header into the net, somewhat against the run of play.It was a cruel blow for Strangford, but things were about to get worse, much worse.Referee Aide Sharvin who had a good game, had the whistle in his mouth to blow for half-time when the influential Connor McCarron sent Dowie clear and with the Strangford back four caught flat-footed, he lobbed the ball over Cultra with the last kick of the half to make it -.Strangford knew they had no choice but to throw caution to the wind after the break and that they did, but Aaron Beattie and Conor Marron gave absolutely nothing away at the back for Ballynagross and chances were hard to come by.Ballynagross were now able to hit Strangford on the break and with  minutes gone Cultra pulled off a stunning save to deny the overlapping Tom McNeill and then John Shields on the follow-up.With  minutes gone King blasted wildly over the top for Strangford before Ballynagross were denied what looked a stonewall penalty when Cultra emptied Rooney as he darted into the penalty box, but the referee waved play on.Ballynagross were not to be denied their third goal and with  minutes gone Shields played a delightful ball into the path of Rooney and from the right hand side of the box he unleashed a vicious volley that had goal written all over it from the moment it left his boot.Strangford still refused to throw in the towel and apart from a double save from close in by Cathail Arnold, they never really threatened, despite seeing their fair share of possession.Ballynagross could have won by a bigger margin, but Cultra stood big and tall and kept the final tally down with several more good saves.Ballynagross: Cathail Arnold, Tom McNeill, Deaglan Craig, Connor Marron, Aaron Beattie, Conor McCarron, Cormac Byrne, John Shields, Daniel Taggart, Eoin Rooney, Declan Dowie.

That is what is happening. The campaign to incite schools to disregard measured advice from the executive and follow instead the southern Irish model is nothing less than a coup.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...These people cloak their agenda in apparent concern for lives and health, but nationalists scent blood and it is not the blood of Covid- victims. Rather it is the end of the United Kingdom that John O’Dowd, for example, surely thinks he smells when he tweets about the ‘shire’ of bastards in the British government.This crusade is likely to succeed because unionists too are worried about the disease and it is a very natural instinct to shout for something to be done, more to be done, now, when a serious problem is current. The Irish government is taking that view, but the Northern Ireland executive is following professional advice closely and taking an approach that can seem counterintuitive.It doesn’t much matter whether one is right and one is not. Nationalist Ireland has made up its mind without even listening to the arguments. Every time Northern Ireland’s status as part of the UK takes a concrete form, whether it’s the fact that people born here are British citizens, or that we will leave the EU with the rest of the country, or our inclusion in the UK’s medical advice, there is a fearful tantrum.I’ll be very clear, I don’t know how best to counter the coronavirus. My we is a doctor at the frontline of this crisis, and we talk about it every day, but this situation is unprecedented.Those who claim that they know better than public health experts should shut up.Public opinion is irrelevant in this crisis.All the tweeters and twitterers are irrelevant.The experts who are plotting a course through coronavirus are not infallible. But they know incomparably more than John O’Dowd, Martina Anderson, and their ilk.Amid the atmosphere of anglophobia, on Twitter, an economist, David McWilliams, described Britain as a ‘rogue state’. If Boris Johnson’s decisions applied only to the mainland this type of language would not be employed.After the Netherlands decided to follow a strategy close to that of the UK, thepublished an article including scathing quotes dismissing that position but not one from any of the scientists supporting it.Joe Brolly, the barrister and former GAA participant, similarly on BBC Radio Ulster Talkback cited a host of sources, without acknowledging that Britain’s experts know incomparable more than him.Nationalist Ireland is closing ranks. The Catholic church has called for schools to close, while the UK government and the health minister say that would be counterproductive. This overall response began to take-off on Friday morning, when Sinn Fein changed its stance on possible school closures in response to a demand from nationalists for an all-Ireland approach.Here is the lesson for unionists. Determined nationalists will try to erode Northern Ireland’s Britishness at any opportunity and forever and they will never be appeased. It’s psychological. They don’t care about science or facts — they will bend the evidence to their desired outcome. If we have any reason for optimism, it is the reaction of the ‘middle ground’, Alliance included. They have clearly been appalled by the tribal reaction of Sinn Fein et al to this crisis.Northern Ireland is behind both the rest of Ireland and the rest of the UK when it comes to coronavirus.We have grounds for optimism. But the insatiable, unrelenting demands of nationalism will continue whatever the crisis.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I was one of the eighteen and a half million people watching on TV after midnight as Dennis Taylor from Coalisland recovered from a seemingly impossible deficit to beat the machine-like Steve Davis on the final black.Less than three weeks later Manchester United faced Everton in football’s FA Cup final on a sunny Saturday at Wembley. Everton were the strong favourites having easily won the league title that season. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The odds against United were stacked even steeper when defender Kevin Moran became the first player ever to be sent off in the cup final.The match was goalless in extra time when Norman Whiteside from the Shankill Road went on a solo run before curling a low shot past Everton keeper Neville Southall to win the fabled trophy for United.Three weeks after that Barry McGuigan, from the border village of Clones, was challenging the legendary Eusebio Pedroza for the featherweight boxing world title at Loftus Road in London.My da and uncle attended the fight. For a young boy from north Antrim who had never been off this island, their expedition could not have been any more exotic thanmy da had told me they were going on safari to Saturn’s rings and were stopping off for some sightseeing at the Great Red Spot of Jupiter on the way home.While my da experienced the fevered atmosphere in the ground, I watched on television on a stirring night as the seemingly inexhaustible McGuigan battered the grand old champion around the ring for  rounds to rip the world title from his grasp.In his corner that night was Barney Eastwood. At the time I knew Eastwood only as McGuigan’s manager and the man whose bald head was always protruding into the corner of the camera shot while Barry was being interviewed in the ring after his fights.Now I have a better understanding of how boxing is as much a business as a sport and an appreciation of the scale of Eastwood’s achievement in establishing Belfast as a base for the trade, and also for how he tempted the wily Pedroza to London to risk defending his title on alien soil in front of a raucously partisan crowd.I was planning to write that these memories were rekindled in my memory following the death of the veteran businessman and promoter last week but that’s not quite accurate. The truth is that Barry’s glory night, just like Whiteside’s goal and Taylor’s triumph are never very far from my mind and require no prompt.More than that, the images and emotions are seared into my consciousness, photographs that will never fade or turn sepia.Dennis Taylor shaking his cue and wagging his finger in delight after stunning Davis. Norman Whiteside, with the number  on the back of his stained jersey, running with his arms aloft to salute the crowd after his wonder goal. I still know the words from United’s  FA Cup final song.And the fight. Pedroza’s imposing moustache and sideburns. Barry’s father singing ‘Danny Boy’ in the ring. Commentator Harry Carpenter in the seventh bemoaning the fact that ‘McGuigan’s work has been less effective in this round’ just one second before the Clones Cyclone exploded a devastating straight right which felled the Panamanian champion.The older I get the more trouble I have retaining information, but the paint will always remain wet and brilliant on those great canvases.The common thread is obvious, three tales of local boys who overcame the odds to become masters on the international stage. Proving a point to an awed -year-old that where you come from does not have to be a barrier to what you can achieve, that the destination is more important than the starting point.But the real point is, I think, deeper, more profound. It’s the capturing and crystallisation of a precious stage of development of a child. Old enough to understand, but still young enough to have a sense of wonder.There was the guilty excitement of being able to sit up late to watch the snooker even though I had school the next morning. The bragging rights in the playground that my team had won the cup.The countless hours trying to recreate the goal in the field behind our house or potting balls on our miniature snooker table.And the fight. That Christmas I asked Santa to bring me boxing gloves and a punchbag. I wore those little red gloves out trying to convince myself that I could be like Barry McGuigan.Those three occasions have never left me, and few things have marked me in the same way since.Of course, local people had succeeded at world level before , and have continued to do so afterwards. But nothing ever seems as important as it did when you are . The world never again stopped like it did then.The years have wound on. Sometimes though, I’m still able to think like a child. It comes most often late at night when my brain is tired and unable to process coherent thoughts. Then, with my eyes closed in the dark the images of Taylor’s black ball finish or Whiteside’s goal are there.And the fight. The plan devised by Barney and executed by Barry. Sometimes the noise of the crowd is the last thing in my mind before I sleep, with my da somewhere in that throng, singing ‘Here we go! Here we go!

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March . Parents and carers can visit the school at am, pm, and .pm.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On parade in Toronto in “This year it is will be marking its th anniversary, with Orangemen and women from across the globe expected to congregate in the city for the occasion.He explained that the Toronto Twelfth takes places on July  to accommodate the many visitors who have taken part in demonstrations where in the world. Quincey said: “Among those travelling from Ulster are three bands from Donegal, however another band joining them can make the unique claim of already having made that long journey not once but twice.” Portadown True Blues first marched in Toronto in  and then again in  when over  members of the band travelled over , miles to parade.Portadown True Blues on the march in their home town : -TONY HENDRONNNQuincey commented: “Over the decades that have past, relationships kindled during those trips have seen Canadian Brethren make their way back to the ‘home country’ to parade on the Twelfth in Portadown, and this year several of the True Blues who made that journey over  years ago will be ing the favour.”Sam Hill is part of the Portadown Trues Blues committee who are organising the band’s third trip to Toronto.The -year-old said: “This will be my first time in Toronto. The last time the band was there was  and I was still in the Army at the time.“The band over the years has been speaking about going back. “It’s a big financial commitment which made it dficult.“We actually got a special invite from the Canadians for the th anniversary because the band was there before in  and .“We discussed it last year and decidedwe were going we’d be taking the families and all with us.“It was thrown out to the general public as well to come with us and there’s some joining us, some of them are Orangemen. “It’s going to be a big trip.“We were up to  but a few have dropped out because of the coronavirus. We’re down to about  – three bus loads.“Everything is still going ahead as it stands. We’re just going on advice from our own government and Canadians. Canada haven’t got the same flight ban as the US.“We’ll have to sit tight and wait to hear. It could be a last minute decision.”Of the cost of the trip which has prompted a lot of fundraising from the band, Sam said:“It’s cost £, to get everybody there.“We’ve been on the ball with fundraising since August last year.“Now we’re into March and the marching season has started, we’re really looking forward to it.“We did sayeverybody paid their own fare to get there we would raise funds to offset the costs when we get there, to pay for things like buses for excursions. “Some of us are going for  days, the majority just going for a week.“I’m going with my we Sharon, my son and my daughter, I’ve got an older son who isn’t going.“There’s  fathers and sons going out of the band. With one family there’s three generations – Victor Graham is going with his son David and his grandchildren Sam and Bobby.“Aside from the parade they’ll have us playing in Orange halls, clubs and places like that. We’ll be trying to get a bit of freetime for sightseeing, Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, places like that.“There’s people who will be meeting up with family when they’re over.”Of the ‘old boys’ going on the trip Sam said: “There’s a few boys going that were there in  and .“We’ve actually a boy coming from New Zealand, Philip Currie. The plan is he’ll come back to Northern Ireland and travel with us.“Another boy Jimmy McCullough, who was there in , he lives in Las Vegas now, he’s coming up to meet us from there.“He still has his unorm. When he comes home he guests with the band.“Two of the boys who are still in the band – Nigel Morrison and Trevor Whitten – they’ll be there too.“It’s going to be a bit of a reunion as well.“We’ve been going through the band archive to see who was in the band at the time, we’ve been in contact with them.“The reason why we’re going back is it’s the th anniversary or the formation of the Orange over there. It’s the longest running parade in the history of North America.“Because it was the th anniversary and they did ask us back we thought now was the time to go.”In  Portadown True Blues became the first blood and thunder band to form in Portadown.The band was founded by three men - Connie Linton, Glen Yeman and the late Eddie McKinney. Their practice takes place in Clounagh Orange Hall.Sam, who has been in the band since , said: “The band has between  and  members, from primary school age up to older ones. Me and Johnny Burns are there the longest. Johnny has been there  years.“I’ve been secretary, I’ve been chairman, the whole lot. I’m just an ordinary band member now and I’m on the Canada sub committee.”Sam is joined on the True Blues Canada sub committee by band chairman Stephen Woods, Stuart Currie, Dickie Craven and Jamie Kerr.Orangeism was present in Canada less than  years after its formation in Co Armagh, with the first documented Lodge being active by  in the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec. Other lodges soon came into existence, but they were essentially all a loose confederation until  when the Grand Orange Lodge of British America was formed. The ‘father’ of the Canadian Order is widely regarded to be the controversial Wexford born Canadian politician and newspaper mogul Ogle Robert Gowan.
