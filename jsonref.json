[{"url":null,"title":"Hero age MPs werent pygmies Biography Airey Neave","story":"    War hero Airey Neave, in a fake German uniform - the photo was taken after his capture at Colditz and remains on displayEven at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe.Later, he became known not just as a Conservative MP but as the scheming consiglieri who used the dark arts of political management to mastermind Margaret Thatcher’s historic election as the first woman to lead the Conservative Party.Now, in the spring of 1979, and with a General Election looming, Neave – Thatcher’s Northern Ireland spokesman – was about to taste real political power for the first time.On Friday, March 30 at 9.30am, he left his Westminster flat for the Commons. With the weekend approaching, Neave had told his wife, Diana, that he would collect her in the afternoon so they could drive to their constituency home in Oxfordshire.Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office.The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRA.Neave’s injuries were so severe that initially no one recognised him. It took almost half an hour to free him from the debris and load him into an ambulance bound for Westminster Hospital a mile away. He died eight minutes after arriving, just before Diana could reach him.When Margaret Thatcher gave her first tributes to her friend, grief and shock were still etched on her face.          Even at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe‘He was one of freedom’s warriors,’ she said. ‘He was staunch, brave, true, strong. But very gentle and kind and loyal.’‘Some devils got him,’ she later added, with personal force. ‘And they must never, never, never be allowed to triumph.’As the Conservatives’ Northern Ireland spokesman, Neave had voiced trenchant views on Republican paramilitaries – he wanted the death sentence for convicted terrorists – and it now seems extraordinary that he didn’t have a police bodyguard. In fact, he had been pressed to accept protection, but he had rejected the offer. For, as Sir David McNee, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner said at the time: ‘He made it clear that if as an Englishman he could not walk the streets of London freely, life for him was truly not worth living.’Freedom and the impulse to escape are at the heart of Neave’s story and his extraordinary, Boy’s Own adventures.He had a conventional, if privileged, upbringing, the son of a noted naturalist, with two governors of the Bank of England among his forebears. Educated at Eton and Oxford, it was with the outbreak of the Second World War that his appetite for bravery and daring came to the fore.          Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office. The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRAIn May 1940, Neave found himself in the Royal Artillery, fighting a desperate rearguard action as German Panzers advanced on the burning ruins of Calais. The odds were overwhelmingly stacked against him and Neave was lucky to survive when a bullet hit him on the left side, missing his heart by only half an inch. Captured by German troops because he was too weak to escape, he was taken into the heart of Nazi-controlled Europe and imprisoned.It was early the following year, when he was moved by train to Stalag XX-A near the Polish city of Thorn (modern-day Torun), that Neave showed his true colours again. Within weeks he had hatched a painstakingly thought-out escape plan. Stalag XX-A was like a small town, with outposts and suburbs and a labour force made up of prisoners who the Germans put to work. Central to the escape plot was a visit to the dentist’s wooden hut in the centre of the compound.The Germans allowed British officers to have their teeth examined every Thursday and it was Neave’s good fortune that he suffered from inflamed gums. His plan went swimmingly at first. After his session in the chair, Neave made way for Flying Officer Norman Forbes, a Hurricane pilot, and was allowed to go unescorted to the latrine next door.Inside, he retrieved some lengths of wood hidden in the ceiling by accomplices to be used as props. Neave was soon joined by Forbes and, at a signal from a sergeant who was keeping watch outside, they stepped out, carrying the timber, ostensibly just two ordinary soldiers engaged on some errand.They spent the next three days hidden by their fellow prisoners then, at 6am on the morning of April 19, after a cup of ersatz coffee, Neave and Forbes left the camp concealed amid a gang of 150 prisoners bound for a farm, where they were put to work in a barn. On a signal that the coast was clear, Neave and Forbes climbed into the loft and burrowed into the hay.

It was not until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold on the pair that police say their investigation shifted and put Smollett in the frame.  On Monday, an interview Roberts had landed with the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department who tore through Smollett will air. Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson reserved no mercy for Smollett as he announced the police\u0027s case against him on Thursday morning. During an extraordinary press conference, he made reference to Smollett\u0027s tearful GMA appearance and condemned it, saying he could not watch the whole thing because it \u0027angered\u0027 him.           Their interview was the first time Smollett had answered questions about the case publicly \u0027To be quite honest, it\u0027s shameful. It painted this city that we all love and work hard in in a negative connotation.\u0027To insinuate an to stage a hate crime of that nature when he knew as a celebrity it would get a lot of attention, it\u0027s just despicable.   Jussie Smollett is shown in his mugshot on Thursday morning\u0027It makes you wonder what goes through someone\u0027s mind so yes, I did see part of the interview and I was angered by it,\u0027 he said. He also said that Smollett helped their investigation into him along by confirming to Roberts that the two men in the video - who they knew were Abel and Ola Osundairo - were the attackers.\u0027He identified who those two iniduals were. We knew that then but he didn\u0027t know that we knew.\u0027But yeah he helped us out when he identified them,\u0027 he said. During the interview, Smollett reacted to suspicion over his cooperation with the police investigation by insisting he was telling the truth. \u0027You do such a disservice when you lie about this kind of stuff,\u0027 he said.   Elsewhere he described himself \u0027fighting the f*** back\u0027 when he was jumped, screaming as he realized there was a noose around his neck and then calling the police with his 60-year-old friend Frank Gatson.He blamed the fact that he was being doubted on the political climate and said: \u0027The camera, facing north, how is that my issue? It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot more.\u0027 He also raised his voice when asked by Roberts about the fact people were suspicious he had gone out in subzero temperatures at 2am to get a salad from Subway.    Roberts will interview Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson on Monday. He eviscerated the actor on Thursday morning and mentioned the ABC interview in his remarks, describing it as \u0027shameful\u0027 that Smollett would go on television to allegedly lie \u0027Subway is open for 24 hours. People kill me when they say stuff like that because Subway is open 24 hours for a reason so that when you\u0027re hungry at night and you ain\u0027t got no food, you go to Subway!\u0027 he said.He said he was frustrated that Chicago Police had not yet found surveillance footage of the incident and revealed his disappointment after learning that a camera at the very spot of the attack was turned in the opposite direction when it took place. Choking back tears, he explained when asked why it took so long for him to contact the authorities: \u0027There is a level of pride there.\u0027We live in a society where as a gay man you are considered somehow to be weak and I am not weak. I am not weak and we as a people are not weak.\u0027  Smollett was bailed out of Cook County Jail on Thursday afternoon after posting $10,000 in bond money, ten percent of the total $100,000 that was set by a judge. His attorneys insist he is innocent and say he has been treated unfairly by the police and the prosecutor\u0027s office."},{"url":null,"title":"The true cost Meghans baby shower","story":"    At a tricky crossroads: Meghan in New York with Suits actress Abigail SpencerThe Duchess of Sussex was in New York this week, catching up with friends, having lunch and doing a little light shopping. It was a private visit so there was no additional cost to the British taxpayer.She is already back at work, flying the flag for Britain on a high-profile official visit to Morocco, where she and the Duke will promote diplomatic relations, boost UK interests and support humanitarian causes.Just another week in the everyday story of royal folk? Hardly. As Princess Diana’s private secretary, I learned to recognise that the line between official and private travel is never just about the money. It’s a code that opens a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences.Rich people’s jets — in this case a Gulfstream reportedly paid for by George and Amal Clooney — always come with a bill attached, even if it’s not the kind you can pay with a Duchy of Cornwall credit card.Favours must be returned, obligations quickly multiply and pretty soon royal free-riders are handing over their most precious assets: credibility and dignity, if not, please God, their lives.The uproar created in some quarters by Meghan’s brief, but undeniably extravagant, Big Apple excursion could hardly have been greater if she had run naked down Broadway and burned a Union Jack in Times Square.But let’s keep a sense of proportion here. A high-profile former actress, she happens to have rich celebrity friends and, if they behave as rich celebrities usually do, then good luck to her, surely.Anyway, other members of the Royal Family, notably Prince Charles and Camilla, have often been known graciously to accept favours from the mega-rich, especially if there’s a jet, a yacht or a private island on offer. Just don’t tactlessly mention the environmental damage.This whole subject is a high-hypocrisy zone, so instead, relax, enjoy the exotic pictures and remember the words of Jimmy Stewart’s character, the cynical hack Macaulay Connor in The Philadelphia Story: ‘The prettiest sight in this fine pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.’Royal dramas of this kind tend to fizzle out pretty quickly, fit only for tomorrow’s recycling bin.There will surely be some courtiers this morning (not least in Casablanca with the Duke and Duchess) who are trying this explanation on for size. Perhaps it will all blow over, they hope, and the British public’s love for its excitingly-disruptive American newcomer will resume undiminished.After all, it seems only yesterday that Her Royal Highness was winning hearts with her ‘bananagrams’ for sex workers in Bristol, recipe-sharing with women in the Grenfell community kitchen, and speech-making on women’s education and women’s suffrage on a hugely successful tour Down Under in October.

Five nights in a one-bedroom suite at The Mark Hotel costs $9,982.05Yet the excesses of the baby shower now threaten the benign indifference of the British public — an accident of history that is the Windsors’ most precious, but also most volatile, asset. Unfortunately for Meghan, in Windsor World it doesn’t require wicked intent to set the centuries-old edifice a-tremble: not knowing what you don’t know will do the job just as well.In this context, it’s hard to remember Meghan’s eager determination to ‘hit the ground running’ in her new royal career and not compare it with her sister-in-law Catherine’s less exciting but, in retrospect, wiser intention ‘to learn the ropes’.All Meghan’s running has brought her, at private-jet velocity, to a lonely crossroads. It’s a stark choice between the path of celebrity versus the path of duty, service and sacrifice.Did she recognise this dilemma before Prince Harry slipped that engagement ring onto her finger? As a gifted, intelligent and worldly woman, the answer is, surely, of course she did. She will also know that in marrying the Queen’s grandson, she has allied her interests with the Windsors’ instinct to protect their dynasty at any cost.          Duchess of Sussex visits  the Hubb Community Kitchen, LondonMeghan’s crossroads is as old as monarchy itself. A whole tribe of gutsy royal women have been here before her. In the last 100 years, several have been the spine and heart of the British Monarchy.These include: Alexandra, who endured Edward VII’s serial philandering and pioneered a new style of compassionate royal work Mary, who steeled her husband in World War I and Elizabeth the Queen Mother who did the same in WWII and the present Elizabeth, whose reign will likely never be surpassed as the standard for service before self.The common factor was a recognition that royal privilege and perks have to be paid for, not by rich chums, but by a lifetime of service to the people whose bows, curtsies and taxes will always be willingly given in return. Better make that probably willingly.Other women also passed this way. In the present reign, there has been a high failure rate of church weddings of first-rank Royal Family members. Only three, out of seven, have escaped the orce courts.One of those statistics was Harry’s mother, whose experience has hopefully also been carefully studied by Meghan. In comparing the two women, differences quickly outnumber any similarities. Diana’s 16-year royal career was already consigned to history before she reached the age Meghan is now.Meghan is no teen virgin, but a orced, media-smart and ambitious celebrity, empowered by all the arsenal of right-on feminism. Her fate is emphatically in her own hands, as it should be.Recent lurid headlines will fade, hurried on their way by the imminent arrival of what will surely be the most photogenic of babies.But that crossroads will, I predict, obstinately remain.Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to HRH The Princess of Wales 1988-96.

I want to persuade you to be a feminist.’‘I’m already a feminist,’ I replied.‘No, I mean a proper one.’‘I AM a proper one.’We stared at each other like two dogs meeting for the first time on a beach, eyeing up whether to wag our tails at each other or have a fight.‘Well you have a funny way of showing it,’ she scoffed. ‘You’re always telling women how to dress and behave.’‘No, I’m not. I just don’t think female stars with millions of young female fans should use nudity as a commercial tool. I don’t think that’s feminism, it’s exploitation.’‘No it’s NOT!’ she seethed. ‘A woman should be able to do whatever she wants, without limits and without some man always criticising her.’‘So, women can murder people?’‘Sorry, WHAT? No, of course not. Don’t be ridiculous.’‘So, there are limits then?’‘To committing murder, yes! But there’s nothing empowering about murder.’‘Those doing it might disagree, but you get my point. There are always limits, to everything. And now we’ve established there are limits to feminism, what did you think about Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajowski when they posted topless selfies of themselves flipping the bird? How is that remotely empowering?’‘It’s empowering because they are both free to do whatever they want with their bodies, and if they want to express themselves in that way, that is their choice and their right.’‘Sure, but isn’t it also my choice and right to criticise them for it?’‘Why should you?’          So now here she was, my pint-sized nemesis – standing just 5ft 3in tall, wearing a large sweatshirt and very small shorts, and with her striking brown eyes blazing defiantly at me. She walked over and shook my hand‘Because I think it sends the wrong message to young girls that the only way to succeed in life is to strip off and be rude.’‘No, it tells them that they shouldn’t have to get a man’s permission to do what they want with their bodies. It’s their life, their body. There’s such a double standard – male stars like Justin Bieber go topless all the time but nobody attacks him for it. I’m sure Kim and Emily did that picture because they were sick and tired of people criticising them all the time.’‘No,’ I interrupted, ‘they did it for commercial gain. Their careers are literally built on taking their clothes off and they’ve made millions doing it. They don’t have a world class talent like you.’I mentioned how I mock-tweeted about Kim Kardashian two nights ago when she appeared at a Hollywood beauty awards show in a tacky, cleavage-bulging bondage style black cut-out Thierry Mugler dress.Ariana thought for a few seconds.‘Let me say this: when you criticise women for what they wear like that, you don’t know what else they’ve been trying on to get to that point. You don’t know all the stress, and all the outfits, they’ve gone through trying to decide what will work and won’t work. It can be so nerve-wracking. You also don’t know how much they’ve been body shamed and what effect that has on any woman. It can make you feel horrible.’These were good points, but she needed a better example to illustrate them than the world’s most shameless clotheshorse.‘Kim Kardashian wears this outrageous stuff specifically so we all talk about it,’ I protested, ‘it’s literally her brand.’‘OK, but you were so wrong about Little Mix. I toured with those girls and I understood exactly what they were doing and saying. They were standing up for all girls who’ve been called those horrible names, and saying it doesn’t matter what people call you, you should feel proud of yourself and your body, and strong. I felt that when I saw their photo.’‘You did?’‘Yes. I used to be called all those horrible names myself, long before I was famous or even an adult. So with respect, I can relate to what young girls go through far better than you.’‘I accept that. But I have a 7-year-old daughter, I don’t want her thinking nudity is the route to success. That is my concern.’‘I understand that, I do,’ she said, but you should want your daughter to grow up believing she is free to do what she wants with her body and with her life.’‘I do, but whilst I believe you when you say YOU don’t use nudity or sex as a cynical commercial tool, and that for you it is a form of art attached to your performing, there are some other female stars who I am damn sure do.’‘I agree,’ she replied. ‘See, I AGREE. We’ve reached common ground again. Let’s get another drink to celebrate.’          Two large glasses of a very expensive Californian red appeared in seconds and we toasted each other by clinking them together. But she wasn’t happy when I looked away as I did itAriana turned to a waiter standing nearby.‘Can you get me and my new best friend Piers a glass of wine please?’ she asked him. ‘I’m paying.’Two large glasses of a very expensive Californian red appeared in seconds and we toasted each other by clinking them together.But she wasn’t happy when I looked away as I did it.‘NO! NO! NO!’ she screamed. ‘Always look me in the eye as you clink. Do it again!’We clinked again, and this time I looked into her eyes.‘That’s better. OK, now we can drink.’‘Fiery little thing, aren’t you?’ I laughed.‘I’m Italian, half Sicilian, half Abruzzese. So I make no apologies for being passionate – it’s in my blood!’Victoria suddenly announced that she wanted to perform a trick with a toothpick and napkin, so we all stopped talking to watch.It was a simple, but well executed trick, and we applauded.‘This is fun,’ said Ariana. ‘I’m glad we bumped into each other.’‘Me too,’ I said, and I meant it. She’s a bright, lively, warm and entertaining young woman.But our F-word debate was far from over.‘I think radical feminism does immense damage to feminists,’ I suggested.‘What do you mean by radical feminism?’ she asked.I took out my phone and showed her a photo I had tweeted earlier in the day of a desecrated statue in Florida.Last Sunday, a former US sailor named George Mendonsa died.He was immortalised by Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous World War II photo on V-J Day in Times Square, which caught euphoric George sweeping dental nurse Greta Friedman – a stranger to him – into his arms and kissing her.They later became friends, and Greta said she had no issue with what George had done, understanding that he was showing spontaneous appreciation for all the work nurses did in the war.But on Monday, the day after George Mendonsa died, the statue depicting the moment was defaced with the words #MeToo in red paint.‘This is where radical feminism damages feminists,’ I said.‘I agree that doesn’t seem right,’ Ariana nodded. ‘There has to be some common sense and balance.’          Mac was the rapper Mac Miller, her boyfriend of two years who died of a drugs overdose last September, just a few months after they split up. Tears were flowing down her cheeks as I began to play the song, which is a beautiful, soulful cover version‘If women hate men, then everyone loses,’ I said.‘Yes, I agree. But women don’t hate men.’‘Some radical feminists definitely hate men.’‘OK, some may do. But most women don’t.’‘No, and most men want to treat women properly, fairly and equally.’‘OK, I accept that too.’We smiled.‘See, we’re really getting somewhere!’ she cried. ‘This is good. We’re finding common ground.’‘You know what else really p****d me off?’ I continued. ‘When “Baby It’s Cold Outside” was banned by some American radio stations for supposedly representing sexual assault. That’s bullsh*t.’Ariana’s eyes promptly welled up with tears.‘You OK?’ I asked.‘Yes, I’m sorry. That song is special to me.’Then she took my phone and hurriedly Googled something.‘There… Mac and I recorded a duet of it together. Not many people know about it. I love that song.’Mac was the rapper Mac Miller, her boyfriend of two years who died of a drugs overdose last September, just a few months after they split up.Tears were flowing down her cheeks as I began to play the song, which is a beautiful, soulful cover version.I suddenly felt incredibly sad for her.For a young woman, Ariana Grande’s had to endure some awful things in her life.‘You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you?’ I said.‘Yes. I don’t want to make out I’m been through any worse than anyone else. Everyone has their problems and their sh*t to deal with. But in recent years, I have…had a lot of pain and sadness.’The Manchester terror attack was an unimaginably dreadful and emotionally scarring experience.‘You know, I really admired your guts when you went back and put on that concert,’ I said. ‘I remember seeing you on stage, alone and tiny, and thinking how frightened you must have felt looking out at a huge stadium full of people and not knowing for sure there wasn’t some other lunatic out there waiting to do something terrible again.’‘I…..I……’ Ariana tried to speak, but tears flowed again. ‘I was scared, yes. But I had to do it.’‘I’ll be honest, I thought you were wrong to fly home after the attack.’‘I didn’t want to,’ she said, ‘I was told to, and it was all so chaotic and upsetting I just did what I was told. I wasn’t thinking straight.’‘I wrote a column attacking you for it.’‘You did? I never saw that.’‘Then you probably didn’t see my second column apologising to you when you flew back?’‘No!’I pulled out my phone again, found the column and urged her to read it.‘I don’t know if I want to, it all brings back such terrible memories for me.’But she did read it, slowly and carefully.The column ended with these words:‘Ariana, we’ve never met and I doubt I’ll be on your dinner party schedule any time soon. But I want you to know this: I seriously misjudged you. I had you down as just another self-obsessed millionaire pop star prepared to put her own safety before that of her fans. I was completely wrong. In fact, you’re an exceptional young woman who last night put on an exceptional show and in doing so, sent a massive two fingers to the disgusting creeps who thought they could bomb you and your fans into submission. That took huge personal courage, yes. But more than that, it took spirit. An indomitable spirit.The Blitz spirit. The kind that says: ‘I don’t care who you are, or how badly you want to hurt me or my way of life, or that of those I love, I’m not having it.’ My army brother says there are two types of people in life: those you’d want in the trenches next to you, and those you wouldn’t. Ms Grande, I’d have you in the trenches next to me any time. I’m sorry I questioned your courage. You’re one helluva gutsy young lady.’As Ariana finished reading this, she wept again.‘That was so kind, thank you.’‘I meant it,’ I replied. ‘I very rarely apologise to anyone for anything but I misjudged you, and I wanted to say so.’‘Well, I appreciate that. It seems I misjudged you, too.’John handed her a tissue.‘I’m so sorry for crying so much!’ she laughed. ‘I’m a very emotional person and these things really affect me.’‘It would be very strange if they didn’t,’ I said.‘Come meet my friends,’ Ariana commanded, so John and I walked over with her to her table and met her group.‘Good news!’ I announced, ‘Ariana’s decided to make her next record about me, it’s going to be called Thank u Piersy.’They looked at each other uneasily, then realised I was joking and laughed, with palpable relief.More wine arrived, and Ariana reprimanded me again for incorrect clinking technique. ‘LOOK INTO MY EYES!’‘Apologies.’I looked into her eyes and then proposed a toast to her and her team for their chart-busting triumph.‘You should all be very proud,’ I said, ‘this is an amazing achievement.’‘I couldn’t do any of this without these wonderful people,’ Ariana responded. ‘I have worked so hard to get to this point, so many shows, so many flights, so many hotels, so many media appearances, I’ve done whatever has needed to be done. I have no other life at the moment. But when you get a week like, you realise what you’ve been working for.’‘Has it been worth all the sacrifice?’‘Yes. It’s what I wanted. I love music. It’s my life. Music and my friends like these guys.’Then she turned to them: ‘I’ve been educating Piers about feminism.’They laughed, and I laughed.‘The most important thing you said tonight is that feminists have to bring men with them in their battle,’ I said. ‘Annie Lennox said the same thing to me, and I think it’s vital.’‘Yes,’ she replied, ‘but you men have to bring women with you too. It’s a two-way street. Remember Piers, this is about EQUALITY, in EVERYTHING… including PAY! We should be paid the same as men!’‘I totally agree,’ I said. ‘And men should be paid the same as women, right?’‘Right.’‘OK, so I’d like to be paid the exact same amount as you. What are you earning these days - $20 million a week?’There was a moment of silence before everyone exploded with laughter.‘You can’t sing!’ she insisted.‘I can sing!’ I retorted. ‘In fact, I regularly sing on TV to millions of people. So I demand equal pay as you.’‘That’s not how this works...’ she chuckled.‘Complicated, isn’t it?’ I countered.‘It doesn’t have to be.’Around 11.45pm, two hours of chat later, I stood up to leave.Ariana sprang up too, ran round the table and exclaimed: ‘Can we hug? Would that be inappropriate?’‘Yes, of course,’ I replied.So we hugged.‘I’m so glad we met,’ she said.‘Me too,’ I replied.‘I think we’re going to be good friends,’ she said, ‘we’re a lot more alike than I realised.’Ariana Grande is an extraordinarily charismatic and talented young lady, right at the top of her professional game.I enjoyed her company enormously, and appreciated her desire – particularly in these highly partisan BrexitTrump times - to engage so enthusiastically in respectful debate with someone she had previously locked horns with on Twitter.John and I left, and as we walked back into the chilly Beverly Hills night air, we both burst out laughing.‘Did that just happen?’ he asked.‘It did,’ I said. ‘Only in Hollywood, right?’Shamima Begum pleads for Government to \u0027re-evaluate\u0027 her caseMore evacuation trucks leave last ISIS held area in SyriaChuka Umunna on Labour bullying: \u0027Somebody was arrested for threats\u0027Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Casablanca AirportBystander captures moment Boeing 767 cargo plane starts to crashAaron Campbell caught on mum\u0027s CCTV an hour after killing AleshaJeremy Corbyn: \u0027Shamima Begum should be allowed back into Britain\u0027Hidden camera catches cat breaking out of roommates bathroomState Attorney and R.

A fresh row erupted over claims Labour had failed to discipline an activist who suggested that Dame Louise and fellow Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth (pictured above) did not have ‘human blood’Dame Louise has been repeatedly attacked by Left-wing activists since speaking out on the anti-Semitism scandal, who have seized on her support for the Labour Friends of Israel group, of which she is vice-chairwoman.Her friends said that she was ‘agonising’ over her future in the party which she joined over 55 years ago. One said: ‘She doesn’t like the idea of joining other groups but she is re-ally struggling with how the party’s handled the anti-Semitism row.’          Last Friday, Mr Corbyn – when asked about claims of bullying in Labour – told Sky News: ‘I don’t believe it exists on a wide scale.’Speaking in Tory defector Anna Soubry’s Broxtowe seat – a key Labour target at the next Election – he accused the ‘mainstream media’ of being ‘unkeen on relating to day-to-day issues that people faced in their lives’. He said that in a Sky News interview on Friday he had had to intervene to ask: ‘Is there any chance that anybody other than an MP could be referred to in any of your questions and we could actually talk about the homeless, the poverty, the hospital waiting lists?’In the interview, Mr Corbyn claimed the media ‘only ever talk about Westminster gossip’.But last night, Dudley North MP Ian Austin, one of the nine Labour MPs who walked out of the party last week, accused Mr Corbyn of failing to appreciate the scale of the crisis.He said: ‘Labour will never be in a position to do anything about homelessness and poverty unless it faces up to the nature of his leadership and this really unpleasant culture of intolerance and extremism. Jeremy Corbyn still doesn’t get it.’                        A fresh row erupted over claims Labour had failed to discipline an activist who suggested that Dame Louise and fellow Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth did not have ‘human blood’ – five months after the party’s deputy leader Tom Watson filed a complaint.Mr Corbyn was challenged last week to explain why the party had apparently not suspended Arjum Wajid for ‘outrageous’ attacks on them last summer.Ms Wajid tweeted: ‘Don’t know what runs through their veins, not human blood. Their hearts and brains totally devoid of humanity and eyes blind to truth.’Separately at a private meeting in Westminster last week, Mrs Smeeth told Mr Corbyn: ‘I think you would be happy if I left the party.’When he apparently failed to reply, sources say party general secretary Jennie Formby interjected to tell the MP: ‘I want you to stay.’Mrs Smeeth then issued a vow to remain in the party, saying: ‘I am staying. If I am the last Jew in the Labour Party, I’m staying. I’m not going.’In 2016, Mrs Smeeth left Mr Corbyn’s launch of an anti-Semitism report in tears after being taunted by a Corbynista.Ms Berger’s departure has put pressure on other Jewish MPs in the party – including Dame Louise, Mrs Smeeth, Dame Margaret Hodge and Alex Sobel – to follow suit.Ian Austin, an adopted son of a Jewish refugee, announced he was leaving the party on Friday, but said he would not be joining The Independent Group. Former leader Ed Miliband, who is Jewish, has said he has no intention of quitting the party.Last Friday, Mr Corbyn – when asked about claims of bullying in Labour – told Sky News: ‘I don’t believe it exists on a wide scale.’ Last night, when asked about the decision of her local party to express solidarity with the Wavertree Constituency Labour Party executive, Dame Louise said: ‘This is shameful.’ She refused to confirm that she would quit the party.Party sources said they could not comment on inidual cases but insisted Ms Wajid was still being taken through party disciplinary procedures. A spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.‘All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Hero age MPs werent pygmies Biography Airey Neave","story":"    War hero Airey Neave, in a fake German uniform - the photo was taken after his capture at Colditz and remains on displayEven at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe.Later, he became known not just as a Conservative MP but as the scheming consiglieri who used the dark arts of political management to mastermind Margaret Thatcher’s historic election as the first woman to lead the Conservative Party.Now, in the spring of 1979, and with a General Election looming, Neave – Thatcher’s Northern Ireland spokesman – was about to taste real political power for the first time.On Friday, March 30 at 9.30am, he left his Westminster flat for the Commons. With the weekend approaching, Neave had told his wife, Diana, that he would collect her in the afternoon so they could drive to their constituency home in Oxfordshire.Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office.The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRA.Neave’s injuries were so severe that initially no one recognised him. It took almost half an hour to free him from the debris and load him into an ambulance bound for Westminster Hospital a mile away. He died eight minutes after arriving, just before Diana could reach him.When Margaret Thatcher gave her first tributes to her friend, grief and shock were still etched on her face.          Even at the age of 63, and with a lifetime of bravery and adventure behind him, Airey Neave had much to look forward to. Handsome, charismatic and popular, Neave was one of our most distinguished and romantic figures – a decorated war hero, the first British officer to escape from Colditz, and a spymaster who went on to organise vital escape routes for air crews and prisoners of war from the terrors of Nazi-occupied Europe‘He was one of freedom’s warriors,’ she said. ‘He was staunch, brave, true, strong. But very gentle and kind and loyal.’‘Some devils got him,’ she later added, with personal force. ‘And they must never, never, never be allowed to triumph.’As the Conservatives’ Northern Ireland spokesman, Neave had voiced trenchant views on Republican paramilitaries – he wanted the death sentence for convicted terrorists – and it now seems extraordinary that he didn’t have a police bodyguard. In fact, he had been pressed to accept protection, but he had rejected the offer. For, as Sir David McNee, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner said at the time: ‘He made it clear that if as an Englishman he could not walk the streets of London freely, life for him was truly not worth living.’Freedom and the impulse to escape are at the heart of Neave’s story and his extraordinary, Boy’s Own adventures.He had a conventional, if privileged, upbringing, the son of a noted naturalist, with two governors of the Bank of England among his forebears. Educated at Eton and Oxford, it was with the outbreak of the Second World War that his appetite for bravery and daring came to the fore.          Shortly before 3pm, his work completed, Neave headed to Parliament’s underground car park to collect his Vauxhall Cavalier. He turned the key in the ignition and drove up the ramp that led to the cobbles of New Palace Yard and the exit gate. At 2.58pm, the Palace of Westminster was shaken by a thunderous explosion. As the smoke cleared, the smouldering remnants of Neave’s Vauxhall could be seen immediately beneath the windows of Mrs Thatcher’s office. The Cavalier had been blown to smithereens by a car bomb – planted, it would later be confirmed, by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a faction of the IRAIn May 1940, Neave found himself in the Royal Artillery, fighting a desperate rearguard action as German Panzers advanced on the burning ruins of Calais. The odds were overwhelmingly stacked against him and Neave was lucky to survive when a bullet hit him on the left side, missing his heart by only half an inch. Captured by German troops because he was too weak to escape, he was taken into the heart of Nazi-controlled Europe and imprisoned.It was early the following year, when he was moved by train to Stalag XX-A near the Polish city of Thorn (modern-day Torun), that Neave showed his true colours again. Within weeks he had hatched a painstakingly thought-out escape plan. Stalag XX-A was like a small town, with outposts and suburbs and a labour force made up of prisoners who the Germans put to work. Central to the escape plot was a visit to the dentist’s wooden hut in the centre of the compound.The Germans allowed British officers to have their teeth examined every Thursday and it was Neave’s good fortune that he suffered from inflamed gums. His plan went swimmingly at first. After his session in the chair, Neave made way for Flying Officer Norman Forbes, a Hurricane pilot, and was allowed to go unescorted to the latrine next door.Inside, he retrieved some lengths of wood hidden in the ceiling by accomplices to be used as props. Neave was soon joined by Forbes and, at a signal from a sergeant who was keeping watch outside, they stepped out, carrying the timber, ostensibly just two ordinary soldiers engaged on some errand.They spent the next three days hidden by their fellow prisoners then, at 6am on the morning of April 19, after a cup of ersatz coffee, Neave and Forbes left the camp concealed amid a gang of 150 prisoners bound for a farm, where they were put to work in a barn. On a signal that the coast was clear, Neave and Forbes climbed into the loft and burrowed into the hay.

Mr Rowe signed the card with an insult.Mr Aram’s use of the n-word came in a conversation with a group of junior male colleagues following a ‘cultural realignment session’ organised by RGA last year.

Henderson Rowe denied this, saying last year a ‘third-party investigation’ was launched into the firm’s trading practices going back six years and ‘no evidence of systematic churning’ was found.Mike Bowers, RGA’s chief operating officer, said: ‘We acknowledge Henderson Rowe has in the past tolerated language and jokes that are inconsistent with Rayliant’s values.

It’s not just concerning – it’s appalling, especially over the issue of anti-Semitism.’Our investigation also shows that Milne has parroted Kremlin propaganda, defending Russian aggression against its neighbours, from its invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 to Vladimir Putin’s ongoing campaign against Ukraine. Our findings prompted the former head of MI6 to warn last night that if Corbyn were to win a General Election, he would have to cut off contact with Milne because of the risk Milne poses to national security.Sir Richard Dearlove, who led the Secret Intelligence Service between 1999 and 2004, said Milne stood ‘no chance’ of passing Whitehall’s system of background checks, known as developed vetting, and so could not be allowed to see classified documents.The Mail on Sunday can reveal:During a university vacation in 1977, Milne visited Lebanon during its civil war, and met Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) terrorists dedicated to destroying Israel by violence Returning to England, he set up and ran a campaign to spread PLO propaganda at Oxford UniversityLater, Milne forged links with Hamas, which remains committed to Israel’s destruction and has perpetrated hundreds of terrorist attacks – and travelled with Corbyn to meet its leaders on a trip to the Middle East funded by UK Hamas sympathisers in 2010After graduating in 1979, he became the business manager for a hardline, pro-Soviet newspaper that backed PLO violence, Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in Iran, the taking of American hostages and the Russian invasion of AfghanistanThe paper’s star columnist was a long-standing Kremlin moleMilne personally backed the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the trigger for decades of terrorist violence, arguing that it was a ‘progressive’ event that was ‘liberating’ Afghan women and improving human rightsAs a reporter for The Guardian newspaper in the 1980s, Milne acquired a powerful mentor – features editor Richard Gott, who was later forced to resign after admitting that he took a series of foreign trips paid for by the Soviets, during which he met KGB officialsAfter the 1984 Provisional IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference – which killed five people and injured 31 – Milne told Guardian colleagues ‘I think it is a very daring attack’, as maimed victims were still being carried from the wreckageIn 2014 he chaired a conference session in Russia at which the star speaker was Vladimir Putin, with all his expenses paid for by its organisers, a think-tank close to Putin’s government. Afterwards, he was criticised by his colleagues at The Guardian, which had boycotted the event because it took place just months after Russia illegally seized Crimea from Ukraine.Last summer, when the depth of Labour’s anti-Semitism crisis first became apparent, Jeremy Corbyn tried to stop Labour adopting the full and unmodified International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.The IHRA says it is anti-Semitic to claim the State of Israel is an inherently ‘racist endeavour’ which has no right to exist. Milne has supported groups that make this anti-Semitic claim and advocate violence to achieve their goals since he was a teenager. Moderate Labour MPs say Milne’s beliefs have an ‘undue influence’ on Labour policy and its mishandling of the anti-Semitism crisis that has engulfed the party.

But he has absolute, complete influence over Corbyn. I don’t think Jeremy makes a decision about anything without Seumas Milne signing off on it.’A senior party staff member said: ‘Without a shadow of a doubt, Corbyn trusts Milne more than anyone. I actually think Corbyn is a little bit thick. It’s no exaggeration to say that Milne is Corbyn’s brain.’He added that this was why Corbyn resisted the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism until he was finally overruled by his National Executive: ‘Seumas has been supporting groups that deny Israel’s right to exist for many years.’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghans caterer gushes Marie Antoinette approved Duchesss baby shower banquet","story":"    The Duchess of Sussex is unlikely to welcome comparisons to the 18th Century French queenExquisitely hand-crafted from an original French recipe dating back to 1862, they were the crowning feature on a table of sweet treats fit for a queen – or at the very least a heavily-pregnant duchess.Four French macaron ‘towers’ from the famous Parisian bakery Ladurée last week became the highlight of the spectacular baby shower feast enjoyed by Meghan Markle and her A-list friends in New York.While the five-day, £350,000 extravaganza – culminating in a party inside America’s most expensive hotel suite at The Mark in Manhattan – made headlines around the world, The Mail on Sunday can today reveal just how opulent Wednesday’s celebratory banquet really was.It was so lavish, in fact, that Ladurée’s website boasts of how its signature macaron towers ‘evoke the Parisian glamour and elegance that Marie Antoinette would approve of’.The Duchess of Sussex is unlikely to welcome comparisons to the 18th Century French queen who, when told that her subjects were starving and had no bread, replied: ‘Let them eat cake.’But the scale and grandeur of the table which greeted famously sweet-toothed Meghan and up to 20 guests was staggering. Central were the four macaron towers, costing a total of £350 and infused with the delicate flavours of rose petals, passion fruit, vanilla and pistachio.Made from organic almond flour, eggs and sugar, each delicate macaron is handmade using two outer shells with a piped ganache filling. Thousands of yellow vest protesters take to the streets...The look that hooked Meghan’s dad: The charming high school...Share this articleThey contain an average of 80 calories each and are gluten-free – and should not be confused with a a traditional British macaroon made with coconut and almonds.The four custom-made pyramid cakes – two medium-sized and two small – were from Ladurée’s store on New York’s exclusive Madison Avenue, an order which requires two-days’ notice.

Scattered arrangements of Meghan’s favourite pink peonies and delicate sweet peas completed the elegant look.In addition to the macaron towers, there was more drama in the cakes and confectionery thought to have been made by Michelin-starred chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose eponymous restaurant at The Mark is considered one of the finest in New York. Meghan, 37, who is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant, is a self-confessed foodie and while guests including her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer, Ms Mulroney, hairdresser Serge Normant and designer Misha Nonoo were serenaded by harpist Erin Hill, the food was the real star. Custom-made cakes including Key lime tarts, cherry tarts, red velvet cakes and carrot cakes, sat beside gold-embellished containers filled with sugar crystals into which stork-shaped biscuits had been artfully arranged.Health-conscious Meghan insisted on items being marked ‘gluten free’ for those with dietary constraints.There were also cotton candy pom poms (candy floss on sticks) – explaining the delivery of a candy floss machine to the hotel during a snow storm on the eve of the party – and a jar of multi-coloured ‘donut holes’ that were gluten-free and just 40 calories each. Sources said Ms Williams’ designer biscuits, including iced storks on lollipop sticks, trays of sweet bunnies with chocolate piping and biscuits in the shape of traditional English prams in blue icing, were a hit.The colour scheme featured multiple hues of blues, pinks, yellows and greens and gave no hint as to the gender of the future Baby Sussex. ‘It was a delicious palate of colours and a very sophisticated table,’ a source said.‘There was no dominant colour theme. It was just opulent, luxurious and completely over the top.’ Cupcakes topped with yellow and orange piped flowers (130 calories each) sat beside mini lemon meringue pies (325 calories) and pink meringues (100 calories).

Meghan, 37, is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant One Los Angeles-based private chef who works for A-list celebrities said: ‘If you look at the ingredients alone, then you’d probably be looking at two to three grand, but when you factor in The Mark hotel and Jean-Georges, then the sky is the limit. If I was to put a figure on an event like this, in a location like that, I’d say ten to 20 grand.’There have been suggestions that the New York bash was used by Meghan to wrest back control of her own image. It certainly drew huge media attention with scores of photographers camped behind barriers outside the hotel.The duchess arrived in New York on February 15. The following day she had dinner with Ms Williams, Ms Mulroney and close friend Markus Anderson.Guests arrived at the baby shower with gifts including a £326 Babyletto crib and a £470 Trek bicycle. Flowers were provided by a company called Lady Fleur and Meghan later donated the arrangements to charities. However, the fate of any left-over food is unknown.

Shabina Aslam, 29, and Alireza Sabar, 17, from Didsbury, Manchester, say they miss their independenceThe case involved another jihadi bride, identified only as ‘G3’, who fled to Syria to join IS with her two children, then aged one and two, in November 2016.

Don’t type it’.I duly handwrote a letter pointing out that I was sad that he didn’t approve of how I was doing my job but luckily vast numbers of other people – Vogue’s readers – did. I suppose Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May must feel the same about the MPs quitting Labour and the Tories over their leadership but I was right and they are wrong.Karl’s gift? He let us enjoy successKarl had no qualms about spending money on himself and at Chanel. For 36 years, he stayed at the head of the most successful fashion house of our times by understanding that most people like to show off their wealth.While doing some research the other day, I came across a column I had written in 2005. It was about how professional, private-school-educated people were terrified of being considered posh. And how het up we all were about the idea of an Old Etonian (David Cameron) becoming the next Prime Minister.I suggested that wearing a Chanel jacket would be as helpful to a successful political career in this country as a touch of leprosy, and a private education was an embarrassing inconvenience, not something to be flaunted.

As our nation considers what it means to be British, Grayson Perry takes a lookby  Grayson Perry and  Martin ParrWhen I first came upon the photography of Martin Parr in a colour supplement at some point in the 1980s, a very loud bell rang. Here was someone who was pointing out with laser precision the aspects of society I didn’t even know I was driven by. He framed anthropological observations that I didn’t yet know I was fascinated by.Class, identity, inidualism and belonging, what it is to be British: in these subjects, Martin’s photos are my guiding text. Often the most affecting encounters with culture are those that make concrete the wisps of feeling we have been sensing for years. For me, the photographs of Martin Parr did just that, and I’m sure they have done the same thing for millions of other people all over the planet.Since that encounter, his work has been a guiding beacon for me, pointing out patterns and dissonances in society, but more importantly showing me how to look. Over his long and prolific career – he has produced more than 100 books and many more exhibitions – Martin has developed an anthropological “satnav” that will take him to where his hyper-developed image-making skills can play and disrupt. His genius is not just in spotting the shot, but in booking the flight and getting the access.What I sensed in those photographs from the off was an ambivalence about the subjects that I shared. I look at images of county ladies stuffing their faces, tourists trapped in clichés, drunken revellers and the jolly grim British working classes, and they all seem to be hovering uncomfortably between comedy and tragedy.Humour bleeds through all these photographs, but also compassion. “How dare you take yourself seriously?” they say, but then “Let’s celebrate that impulse” – in a quietly bonkers, British way, naturally.Like all great artists, Parr has altered how we see the world. We see a queue of posh people, a buffet served on a Union Jack tablecloth or a lurid beach scene and we think of his work. He is one of the foremost chroniclers of our times.He sees our tender aspirations, our vanities, our sincere enthusiasms, our anachronistic traditions, our often unpredictable ersity – and he both ribs us and applauds us, blinded by his flash and decked in saturated colour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4adba333c1cbe1201fb7a795230f4b3e06e93c1/0_0_2477_3567/master/2477.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a88199e94b53f138397ded0fd592752f 960w","title":"images behind the weeks news","story":"Islamic State fighters surrender in Syria, a firefall at Yosemite national park, Central American migrants in Mexico and Karl Lagerfeld’s final collection for Fendi at Milan fashion week – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad02ce0868989407fe6137ce4cca8e155e144d82/0_330_5224_3135/master/5224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb357b3a0c8df648f7d8ae48b7f745c8","title":"japan brexit honda nissan liam fox","story":"The decision to close Honda’s plant in Swindon signals the end of a profitable industrial relationship that was decades in the makingOne of the few remaining elegant wooden buildings in central Tokyo that survived allied bombing in the second world war is the Mitsubishi lodge. The Kaitokaku, set back from the main thoroughfares, its gardens overshadowed by skyscrapers, is a web of beautifully carved wood rooms where executives, bankers and clients who are part of the Mitsubishi keiretsu, or conglomerate network, socialise, with top officials from the phenomenally influential ministry of international trade and industry (MITI), and discuss business privately – drinking sake until three or four in the morning. Deals are done, new technologies discussed and consensus reached on what is happening geopolitically to Japan’s markets and how it should react.The closeness of the relationship between business, finance and state is a universe apart from anything we know in Britain. Critics argue that the keiretsu represents a destructive corporatism and an obstacle to the operation of free and open markets admirers that it allows member companies to share risks, find synergies, lower financing costs and encourage long-termism – so informing Japan’s agile industrial policy and directly leading to Japan having dozens of world-beating companies and brands. By contrast, Britain is not at the races.It will be in similar lodges around Tokyo that Brexit’s impact on Japan’s UK investments will now be discussed. In the 1980s this is where consensus was reached that Margaret Thatcher’s commitment to the European single market and customs union, along with her labour market reforms, offered a major opportunity for Japanese business. It would allow Britain to be the place where Japan could develop its famed “just-in-time” delivery system by sourcing production across Europe, without tariffs, regulatory and customs checks, and foster the recruitment and management of talent Europe-wide. They took her at her word, and the investment boom that has transformed the British car industry was born.Today, a new Japanese consensus has formed. The Conservative party and its leaders cannot be trusted. They ignore warnings, break their word and do not understand business – personified by Old Etonians Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Brexit is a first-order disaster, striking at the heart of how Japanese companies organise themselves as “lean manufacturers”. As Honda’s Patrick Keating, its European government affairs manager, briefed a meeting in Swindon in September, Brexit is likely to interrupt the just-in-time delivery of 2 million parts a day – a fifth of which come from EU suppliers. Those suppliers would have to fill out 60,000 customs declaration forms a year, he warned. One in five of its UK workforce are EU nationals. The world of tariff-free barriers – access to the EU’s free-trade agreements with other countries, and ability to move staff between countries promised by Thatcher – has evaporated in front of Honda’s eyes. Yes, it was operating below capacity, but within the EU Honda could have taken a long-term view and braved the downturn. Brexit forced the plant’s closure and the decision to produce in Japan.The Honda keiretsu is allied to the Mitsubishi keiretsu which finances it and has members on its board: there is no doubt the decision will have been discussed until 4am over sake in the wood-carved rooms of the Kaitokaku. Its decision is part and parcel of the gathering consensus. In the past six months Panasonic, Sony and Nomura – all part of separate keiretsu conglomerates with their in-house banks and close relationships with MITI – have moved their European headquarters from Britain to the EU mainland. The decision by Nissan, member of another keiretsu which includes Canon, Sapporo and Yamaha, not to build its new X-Trail model in Sunderland but at its Japanese production hub in Kyushu was inevitable.British Conservative ministers are regarded by many Japanese as alien creatures locked in a 19th-century time warp. The letter from the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to MITI, saying “time was of the essence” in concluding a free-trade agreement and urging “speed and flexibility” was seen as rude, impolitic and inviting Japan to disregard its interests – echoing an imperial mindset but with none of the accompanying economic clout. Japan intends to be ultra-tough in any trade deal it strikes with Britain.It will want the same preferential tariffs on imported manufactures as it has with the EU, and intends to give as little away as possible on British financial services and food exports. If Fox wants better, best drink sake in the Kaitokaku, build trust and find something Japan needs – such as staying in the customs union and single market, or better still, inside the EU. It would never cross his mind. It is a purblind ignorance that extends to Justin Tomlinson, MP for North Swindon, claiming that Honda’s decision had nothing to do with Brexit. The president of Honda Europe and the Japanese ambassador tried to soften the blow: Brexit was only one factor in the Swindon closure driven by wider trends in car manufacturing. It is important in Japanese culture to give face to people in public to avoid their embarrassment. But no one should be in any doubt. The Japanese car industry, Japan’s ambassador and its government have repeatedly warned of the implications of Brexit and been brushed aside. They are incandescent with anger – and feel betrayed.Brexiters will argue that the impact of Japan’s withdrawal from a UK which last year created some 440,000 jobs can be handled easily. But that was in a UK economy of which Japanese investment was a part. The British economy is an ecosystem: high-paid jobs in car manufacturing in towns such as Swindon and Sunderland sustain other less well-paid jobs, while growth in business and financial service relies on company headquarters being here and not in Europe. Lose them, and apart from particular towns being hard hit, everyone is deflated. Of course, it would be better if there were more indigenous big British employers – but the same daffy rightwing thinking that produced Brexit has undermined British capitalism for decades. Japanese inward investment mitigated our own failures: and is now on its way out. Britain has many more bitter pills to swallow before this whole contemptible business is over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a7a2fed3d98f6132985f06217905236af78bc7/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7ff10acda1b75866bc37e9a8a55f07f","title":"shamima begum sajiv javid","story":"The home secretary, Sajid Javid, might regard this as vindication of his disgraceful decision to deprive Begum of her citizenship last week. But others have expressed dismay at the level of public vitriol.However, it is entirely predictable. I think of my first reaction: not compassion, but anger at the abhorrent views she expressed about Islamic State’s victims. If I had loved ones killed by these terrorists I like to think I’d be one of those amazing souls who moves quickly to forgive. But I suspect I’d be in the “lock her up and throw away the key” brigade.On one level we, the public, don’t have to work through the discombobulating mix of disgust and pity she inspires. You don’t have to deny she is responsible for any crimes she may have committed in order to think she should be brought back to the UK to be held accountable. Once she’s back, we can leave assessing guilt to the courts.There is a danger in allowing the vilification of Begum to go unchallenged. Turning someone into a monster is a protection mechanism: it absolves us from thinking about moral complexity. It permits us to consign evil deeds to a place beyond the pale of understanding. But we lose something important if we don’t try to understand how evil manifests itself: the capacity to prevent it.Take child abuse. Studies suggest we view its causes as “deep and immutable”, so evil that it’s inexplicable. That leads us to believe that the only way to prevent it is to find the evil people and lock them up. To see it as preventable through other means, such as therapeutic interventions, which research shows is possible, is to render child abusers too human for comfort. Understanding feels too close to absolution.In counselling the need for greater understanding of Begum’s actions, some have drawn parallels with the grooming of young girls by paedophile gangs in places such as Rotherham. It’s an analogy that leaves me deeply uncomfortable. Yes, grooming techniques were used on Begum. But in the one case, girls as young as 10 were groomed purely for sexual exploitation in the other, yes, a 15-year old was married, albeit willingly, to a man almost twice her age. But Isis grooms young men and women to fight for a terrorist force that commits genocide. That’s why I find the “she’s nothing more than a child victim” line hard to swallow. What if someone who was radicalised as a child goes on to commit terrible atrocities as an adult? It’s not a hypothetical we don’t know the extent of Begum’s crimes, but radicals have committed atrocities in the name of Isis.Begum’s case reminds me more of a book I read as a teenager – the 1981 novel The Wave, based on events at a California high school. A class of students struggles to understand why ordinary Germans stood by as the Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews. Their teacher sets up an authoritarian membership organisation that demands absolute obedience from its members. Things escalate quickly into violence. The story ends with an assembly to unveil the new leader of a national movement to create youth wings across other schools. An image of Adolf Hitler is projected on to the screen. It also brings to mind the Stanford prison experiment, in which a psychology professor randomly assigned volunteers to be “guards” or “prisoners” in a two-week prison simulation. Within a few days some guards were psychologically abusing and torturing prisoners.The common thread in both is that ordinary people can be induced to act in unsavoury ways, through indoctrination or simulated conditions. And indoctrination is part of the radicalisation process Times reporter Anthony Loyd describes how Begum displays the hallmarks of other indoctrinated jihadists he’s interviewed before.Perhaps those of us who have never had our capacity to commit evil under malign influence tested are lucky, rather than pure. That’s one reason to be grateful for the rule of law. Another is that it allows us the luxury of kneejerk reaction because we’re not in charge of meting out punishment ourselves.But Javid, by weighing in to use powers that politicians have awarded themselves to deprive Begum of citizenship without due process, is messing with that. He’s starting us on the slippery slope to trial by public opinion. And vigilante justice has tragic consequences one of the worst examples is the man who, mistaken for a paedophile, was brutally beaten up and set alight five years ago. In recent years, eight people have killed themselves after being labelled paedophiles by vigilante hunters.Holocaust survivor Primo Levi said: “Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions.” Nothing I have read suggests Begum is a monster. I wonder how many of us would be functionaries in the wrong circumstances. We like to think we embrace the rule of law because we’re better people. But what if we’re better people because we embrace the rule of law? That, ultimately, is why Javid’s actions are so troubling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fdeec972e9ac9b61a6657d57b541541e0982ddf/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=118c62d2cdc29df2206be6099fa78a5a","title":"sorry brexiters ditch those rose rose tinted glasses and join todays world","story":"Where to start with the article by media-vicarsocialist-Leaveretc Giles Fraser, a rumination on the wondrous past, that has caused a very modern Twitter storm?In his piece “Why won’t Remainers talk about family?” (freedom of movementsocial mobility undermines family life… blah blah), Fraser embarked on what one could only presume was a secret mission to make Jacob Rees-Mogg look cutting-edge. Although difficult to condense, it was basically an argument for the UK to go full Amish and stop messing about with that “neoliberal globalisationsocial mobilityfreedom of movement” malarkey.Here are some highlights (paraphrased purely for space reasons, you understand). Children leaving home and moving away (wrong – never mind “abroad”, anywhere outside a 50-yard radius destroys society). Trained (possibly foreign!) carers looking after elderly Britons (evil). Women stalling careers to wipe bums of ailing relatives (marvellous). Men stalling careers to wipe bums (undiscussed). Social care in an ageing society (See “women wiping bums”, even if the relative is horrified and humiliated by this). The family (always brilliant, can’t be faulted). Community (ditto. Anyone finding their home limiting for any reason should be placed inside a neoliberal-themed Wicker Man and publicly burned as a warning to others). Modern ways – free markets, social mobility, freedom of movement (wotevs, right?). The past… the halcyon past! Everything was so much better when ordinary people only had TB, infant mortality, no female agency, no state safety net, no opportunities and a crushing feudal system to deal with. Folk knew their place, you could leave your back door open, you got an orange at Christmas, it was all fields around here when I was a boy…That was quite a bit of paraphrasing, but you get the general gist – Fraser styling himself as Liberal-Blamer General. The depressing truth is that this (blue Laboursocial conservative mindset) very much predates Brexit. Some people really do want everyone to live stifling, stunted lives, tangled up in guilt-soaked familial cum societal membranes.It doesn’t seem to register that many Remainers think constantly of family, not least ones that could be cruelly split. That sometimes parents move around too. That some people, mainly women, are carers as well as working full time. Or that the real scandal is not that carers exist, but that (again mainly female) workers are overworked and underpaid.As for the rest, the past is another country, but not necessarily a better one (certainly not for the majority), so why are some Brexiters obsessed with dragging everyone back there? How can they look at a flawed, but still-vibrant multicultural society and want to transform it into some tacky unworkable theme park of Yon Good Old Days?The nostalgia isn’t merely misplaced, it’s fallacious, sentimental mood music for a British way of life that for most never existed. It may surprise some but, these days, many people have no interest in staying in one place, never mind “knowing their place”. If they’re lucky, they’ll know many places and any parent worth their salt would direct them there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5c84dfd6bb398ec89a73b985e3ad29a5c65490e/0_0_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39bfc4c9739cbf64f360cf047a5f770e","title":"why binary politics leaves britain all at sea","story":"Our two parties are more interested in guaranteeing their own survival than in helping the country to flourishEton College’s most admirable attribute, I’ve long thought, is its motto. A Latin phrase, but not one that would have been familiar to the Romans, Floreat Etona translates as “May Eton flourish”. Contractually speaking, that’s watertight. No bombast and no virtue-signalling. Good luck anyone saying that particular institution has hypocritically betrayed its aims or principles. This place is about this place. It’s like someone proclaiming: “I’m all about me!” – it steals the thunder of any accusations of selfishness.On consulting the college’s website, however, I discovered that Floreat Etona is not, strictly speaking, its motto. “Eton’s motto is often thought to be Floreat Etona,” it says, “… but Esto perpetua (“May it last for ever”) came into usage if anything a little earlier.” I’m not sure what the “if anything” is doing for that sentence. I think if anything it’s superfluous. That’s to say, I think it’s a superfluous “if anything”. If anything. The website carries on: “In fact, neither phrase is officially a motto they are unofficial creations that, over time, have stuck.”I reckon my admiration is still warranted though. “May it last for ever” is tonally pretty similar to “May it flourish”. It’s continuing (or initiating if anything) the general theme of the institution standing for nothing at all other than its own existence – and it’s surely reasonable to take the absence of any motto as signifying that as well. To me, that’s admirable because it’s honest.After all, there are so many institutions claiming to stand for more than that – every aristocratic coat of arms emblazoned with God-fearing Old French (also a sexual position), every company or product with a tagline or mission statement, everything that’s been branded or rebranded. “God and my right.” “I serve.” “Nation shall speak peace unto nation.” “Vorsprung durch technik.” “Because you’re worth it.” They’re all proclaiming, with varying degrees of plausibility, that they stand for something other and more than merely continuing to be. But do they really?In most cases, no. That’s the depressing truth. Obviously businesses don’t. We know they exist to make money, no matter what else they claim they’re “passionate about”. But it’s the same with so many organisations. Having been called into existence, whatever their other ostensible aims, their priority is to continue to exist. Like organisms with an instinct to live, institutions will find people willing to run them and those people will find reasons to keep them going and then strive to do so.The Conservative and Labour parties are good examples of this. They’re always saying they stand for all sorts of stuff, but self-perpetuation remains high up the agenda. And perhaps, with the new loyalty pledge it wants its MPs to sign, Labour is finally admitting it. It reads as follows: “I pledge to work for the achievement of a Labour-led government under whatever leadership members elect. And I accept a Labour-led government is infinitely better than any other election outcome.”I’m not sure the “infinitely” is needed in that sentence, if anything. Has any government ever elected in the UK really been infinitely better than its predecessor? Better to an infinite extent? That would be an infinitely greater improvement than if it were merely a trillion times better. Nevertheless, linguistic carping aside, this is pretty frank: the thing called Labour must prevail, regardless of what that thing actually consists of. Floreat Labour.This has all been a bit much for the MPs who left the party last week on the basis that they no longer like what it stands for. But if organisations want to survive in the institutional ecosystem, they need to adapt and be flexible about their stated aims. Eton started off as a school for the poor.The Tory party is masterful at this. Its survival is currently the entire focus of our government and is monopolising the time of the European Union’s most senior officials. At this point of crisis, with its MPs also beginning to desert, the party is receiving the very best care, whatever it costs the country or the world. Its determination to prevail no matter what disasters that causes is awe-inspiring.I would say, since the whole Brexit cataclysm was triggered in the interests of Tory unity, that, out of these two dangerous institutions, the Conservative party is the worst. And, for Labour, that’s the end of the debate: it’s Labour or the Tories. So, if you don’t like the Tories, you’re Labour. And if you don’t like Jeremy Corbyn, you’re a Tory. The Tories agree and are always saying that, if you don’t vote for them, you’ll get Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister.The two organisations collude in this binary view of politics, just as they have long colluded in maintaining the first-past-the-post electoral system that’s crucial to sustaining it. The UK is a two-party state. Its totalitarianism is mitigated by the sincere enmity with which those two organisations view one another, but, with the country careering towards disaster in their hands, that’s scant consolation. During the Wars of the Roses, the houses of Lancaster and York were fanatically opposed, but that didn’t really provide a meaningful choice of governmental approach.The only subjects on which either element of this political cartel is trustworthy are their opponents’ failings. The Conservatives say the current Labour leadership is institutionally antisemitic and dominated by adherents to the extreme left of the range of views Labour has historically represented. The Labour party says the Tories are cruel incompetents in thrall to corporate interests and lacking an ounce of sympathy for the suffering of the vulnerable. What if they’re both right?The current system in which we’re forced to pick one or other of these options or waste our vote, and any MPs deserting either cause are condemned as traitors, is dysfunctional in the extreme – and the treachery lies with the two parties that conserve it.History will say this country had a deadline by which to fix its political system and that deadline was “before the Brexit referendum”. We missed it. Britain is heading towards disaster because it is not primarily Britain that either the governing party, or the only party with a chance of replacing it, really hopes will flourish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01ae6e1d2ba1b7ae8d1a6325057fcff27c93e20/0_108_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af616d417455472737d666064f86ecde","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

Either you start with the food, then look for a bottle with a range of attributes that will bring out the best in ingredients, or at least not clash with them, casting the wine in the role of condiment. Or you start with the wine, worrying more about avoiding anything (spice, sugar, acid) that will prevent the precious liquid from displaying its charms.Either direction can result in one of those moments when wine and food elevate each other in blissful harmony. The most perceptive dispensers of wine and food matching advice – Fiona Beckett, Joanna Simon and Victoria Moore – are equal parts wine and food lovers who are happy with either route. Moore’s The Wine Dine Dictionary is all about cross-referencing ingredients and wine styles in joyously creative but practical and flexible ways.But there’s a third approach, an anti-philosophy that sees specific and elaborate matches as pretentious and unnecessary. It says: “Enough of telling me this grand cru chablis can only work with turbot au beurre blanc! Stop worrying, put a few bottles on the table and let us all have a good time.”I like my food and wine matching advice the same way I like my recipes – the more precise the better. If I’ve paid attention to balancing flavours in a dish, why would I fill my glass with something that jars like morning orange juice after toothpaste?Fortunately for the “just bung the bottles on the table” school, the wine lists of our better restaurants increasingly have their backs. It’s striking how many sit near the centre of a Venn diagram of particular vinous styles. There are fresh, lower-alcohol, higher-acid reds, either from cool climate areas or from warmer regions where the grapes have been picked earlier for freshness white and orange wines with a spine of acidity but a fuller body (and maybe some tannins) from extended contact with the skins during fermentation or the dead yeast cells during ageing structured, fuller-flavoured and deeper coloured rosés.These are wines that offer the greatest range of possibilities, that can be shared with meals of multiple small plates, or on tables with many guests and orders. They make matching easy, all the while reminding us that a wine that is not up to drinking with at least some foods doesn’t really qualify as wine at all.Di Lenardo Gossip Pinot Grigio RamatoFriuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy 2017 (from £14.95, dorsetwine corksofbristol )While most pinot grigio is made as a white wine, the skins have a grey-purple tint.

The rice has been sitting under its tight lid for 10 minutes, resting, before I run the final seasoning through the soft grains with the tines of a kitchen fork.There isn’t a winter breakfast on earth I enjoy more than warm rice and miso soup.

Warm the groundnut oil in a large, deep casserole over a low to moderate heat then stir in the onions and curry leaves. Let the onions cook for a good 15 minutes until they are soft, pale gold and translucent. A regular stir will help them cook evenly and prevent them sticking.Make the paste using a pestle and mortar or a food processor. I tend to use the latter. Chop the chillies, peel and roughly chop the ginger and peel the garlic, then blend to a paste with the oil and turmeric. Stir the paste into the softening onions and sizzle for a minute or two, then roughly chop and stir in the tomatoes. Continue cooking for 8-10 minutes, letting most of the juices evaporate and stirring regularly, then pour in the coconut milk and mix in the tamarind paste and salt to taste.Cut the white fish into large pieces, each about 40g in weight, then lower into the sauce and cook for 4-5 minutes. Then, as the fish firms up, add the washed clams and prawns, cover tightly with a lid and turn up the heat. Continue cooking for 3 minutes or until the clams have opened and the prawns have gone from grey to pink.Tear the coriander leaves and stir in, check the seasoning and serve with steamed rice. aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Enough for 4, as an accompanimentTip the rice into a large, wide bowl, cover with warm water and move the grains around with your hand until the water turns milky. Drain off the water, then fill with more warm water and repeat. Do this three times or until the water is almost clear.

Grind in half a teaspoon of sea salt and pour in enough water to cover the grains by 2cm. Bring the water to the boil, then lower the heat and cover with a tight lid. Allow the rice to putter away for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and leave for 10 minutes, lid in place.Finely grate the zest from the lime, lemon and orange.

It is questionable whether Rodgers would be willing to leave Celtic mid-season when he has the chance to win an unprecedented third treble in three seasons there.Leicester could also consider Newcastle’s Rafael Benítez, whose contract expires in June, but they have made Rodgers their top target after some months of succession planning.The club’s hope had been that Puel could continue until the end of this season but the heavy defeat by Palace prompted them to act.

Puel’s assistant Jacky Bonnevay has also left.The first-team coaches Mike Stowell and Adam Sadler have been placed in temporary charge. The club may try to bring in an interim manager if they get signals from Rodgers that he is willing to take over in the summer.Leicester, Premier League champions in 2016, are 12th in the table.

That much was vividly demonstrated in the 6-0 humbling at the Etihad in the last game between the sides.Maurizio Sarri said at the time it would take at least a fortnight to get over that result and here we are two weeks later: the same opponent, a bigger stadium, more people watching.After Chelsea were also comprehensively beaten on their own ground by Manchester United in the FA Cup, the score over the last two weeks alone is Manchester 8 London 0. At least Bernardo Silva was able to offer Chelsea a crumb of comfort. “The 6-0 win makes us confident but I think we should forget about it a little bit,” the City midfielder said. “Chelsea are still one of the best sides in the world, with players with the quality to destroy you.”Perhaps the only other good news for a manager jeered by his own supporters in the most recent defeat is that after Sunday he can stop worrying about Mancunian opponents for a while. Sarri will have the visit of Tottenham to look forward to.While Chelsea’s season has concertinaed with surprising speed into a question of whether or not they will manage a top-four finish, City’s has turned into a continuing discussion about the possibility of winning all four trophies. “Almost impossible,” was Kevin De Bruyne’s verdict when the question came up in Germany in midweek and it could be argued that City’s defensive performance against Schalke will not have led many to disbelieve him. Yet City deserve some credit for taking each competition seriously, and the fact that the suggestion is even being made is an indication of how strenuously Pep Guardiola and his players have applied themselves since that shaky period around the turn of the year.It is generally felt that to win the conventional treble of league, Champions League and domestic cup competition a team must either have an exceptional season or be a long way ahead of their rivals. City are on course for an even greater haul, though with four defeats already their league form has hardly been outstanding, and in terms of the title they are being matched and chased by two excellent teams in Liverpool and Spurs.While it is still far too early to suppose City might win everything in sight – the Champions League is surely their greatest challenge – if City are at Wembley facing a side they recently beat 6-0, then the first hurdle is not only in view but vaultable. With City being drawn against Championship opponents in the FA Cup quarter-finals, that competition could easily conform to a similar pattern. The league is in Liverpool’s hands but only if Jürgen Klopp’s team get a result in their game in hand on Sunday – no easy assumption since it is at Old Trafford. All that can be said is that since slipping up so unexpectedly at Newcastle a month ago City have recovered ground faultlessly, giving everyone – including the bookmakers – the impression that they might be better at holding their nerve in the run‑in. While Liverpool are entitled to disagree with that assessment, it is up to them to disprove it.Certainly Chelsea are in no position to argue and, though cup finals always have the capacity to turn form on its head, Sunday’s presents an apparent imbalance between a side adhering successfully to a long-term plan and one displaying all the disadvantages of a lack of continuity. One wonders, for example, whether the Chelsea fans intend to boo Jorginho at Wembley, as they did against Malmö on Thursday.One does not wonder whether Sarri intends to alter his lineup and play N’Golo Kanté in his best position, because a manager who has been resisting such a change all season is probably not going to run with it in a cup final. Sarri recently explained that he is trying to operate a different system from the one that saw Kanté win a title with Chelsea, or the one that saw the France player win the World Cup, a system that requires the most defensive midfielder to be adept at passing the ball forward quickly.Leaving aside the rights and wrongs of that argument, suffice to say that Chelsea cannot have imagined that the manager they brought in from Napoli would find fault with a player who had spent the previous three years giving almost universal satisfaction to Claudio Ranieri, Antonio Conte and Didier Deschamps.Yet that is always going to be a danger with an eighth manager in 10 years. City went to a lot of trouble and paid a high price for their Barcelona-inspired continuity but, now the different components are all in place, the result is a reliable simplicity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dcd2b315bca9e1468df8cb15d467cbbf7605516/0_156_2287_1372/master/2287.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=36bbd51cf606adf5f53d7dcc905dc532 440w","title":"oliver letwin article 50 extension last chance historic","story":"The Conservative MP and former minister says he will vote for an article-50 extension to achieve a better deal – not delay Brexit or seek another referendumTo say that opinions remain ided on Brexit is something of an understatement. But the problem isn’t just that there are disagreements. There are also many different kinds of disagreement – which makes it all too possible for people to get confused about one another’s motives. Those of us who will be voting this week in favour of Yvette Cooper’s bill to extend the article 50 deadline are subject to this kind of misunderstanding.There are, of course, MPs who will vote on Wednesday and Thursday for Yvette’s bill who hope to achieve a long delay and a second referendum. But that is by no means the universal view of those who are supporting it. Many of us strenuously disagree with the idea of a second referendum and want an extension of the article 50 process for just long enough to enable parliament to reach a consensus on a Brexit deal.What joins us all together is the realisation that, if we don’t act now, the UK will sleepwalk out of the EU in just over 30 days with no deal whatsoever. In meetings organised by Conservative former cabinet minister, Dame Caroline Spelman, and Labour frontbencher and trade unionist, Jack Dromey, MPs have been told by businesses, large and small, and trades unions representing every sector about the impact of a no-deal exit on investment, jobs and wages. We are not willing to play Russian roulette with our constituents’ livelihoods.Many of us on the Conservative benches have already voted for the prime minister’s deal once. We are more than prepared to do so again next week and in coming weeks. But we have watched with increasing dismay as the government has shuffled, bit by bit, towards a cliff edge.In a succession of parliamentary votes, we have seen that dozens of our colleagues from the European Research Group are not willing to support the prime minister’s deal except on terms that the EU is unlikely to accept. If this goes on for just four more weeks, we will leave without a deal.The prime minister keeps on telling us that the only way to stop a no-deal Brexit is to vote for her deal. But it is now clear many members of the ERG would actually prefer us to leave the EU without a deal, so any attempt to rely on them to carry her deal through is doomed to fail.So there is only one path open to those of us who seek to find some form of reasonable and orderly Brexit. We need to initiate a cross-party process to find a sensible Brexit compromise that a majority of MPs from political parties across the House of Commons would be willing to support and see through. In order to do that, we first need to secure the parliamentary time and space required to make it happen.This week parliament will have, for the last time, a chance to set this process in train. The prospect of falling by mistake into a no-deal Brexit, simply because we have failed to create an opportunity for cross-party consensus to emerge, would be a tragic and historic mistake.Of course we know that our intentions may be misconstrued and our motives maligned. But we are determined to do what we can to avert disaster, rather than sit on our hands and watch a tragedy unfold as if we had no responsibility for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c304e6fa18274d2bc5fe3c7c3568cd692af8ebb/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd907e73f186f5f81838579cdfdc6e4","title":"struggling to sleep share your experiences","story":"If you have problems sleeping at night we’d like to hear from you is planning a new video project about sleep.We’re hoping to understand more about how people are affected by sleep problems and would like readers to tell us how they navigate sleepless nights.We want to include first-person video testimony from our readers.

In the less brutal of these, I get off the train a few stops early on my way to work and walk along the canal listening to a podcast. It has become clear that this is the only way I can concentrate – when it’s just me, a goose and the good morning smell of marijuana. But it’s also made me realise that when I’m listening to something on headphones, I’m not entirely here.There are infinite reviews of books, music and podcasts, but rarely will someone review the experience of listening. A modern review might acknowledge, for example, that listening to this in motion during an autumnal shower you will feel like Buster Keaton as the front of a house falls down on him. The combination of emotions and dialect will propel the listener to work in a cloud of brick dust, leaving them standing shakily with a window frame around their feet wondering how they got there. Why do we not talk about this more? The dizzying effect of a stranger whispering into your ear?This week I’ve been listening to an audiobook, and the experience has grizzled and slapped me about. Reading a novel, one’s eyes remain focused on the black and white page, but listening to one allows a level of disassociated roaming, the effect of which for me has been a merging of truths. I will reach the steps by the bridge and be quickly struck with the memory of having broken up with my boyfriend at the top, before consciously recalibrating to pin this down in fact as simply the place I was yesterday when the characters broke up in my book. I have new memories of love blossoming at traffic lights, and abuse centred around the biscuit aisle of my local Sainsbury’s. It sounds like nothing, maybe, but for me it’s adding a disconcerting element of virtual reality to my morning commute. There is a danger to it.Of all the clues that I’m getting old, the sight of young people permanently plugged into their headphones is the most confusing. Everywhere, the chattering of mouths into phones that aren’t there, the animated discussion happening between a single person. Headphones the size of croissants, or wireless buds surely begging to fall into a busy road, all ears full, at all times, everywhere. These people appear to be living normal lives, buying fruit, reading messages, savouring the brief joys of a meal-deal’s dessert. And yet, all the time there is somebody singing or talking into their ears. All the time!Me, no. Me, when I am listening to a podcast, I am sitting there on the producer’s lap. I am sitting there on Jon Ronson’s knee as he gently asks a man about his wife’s death. I am propped up in bed with Dan Savage’s caller as she considers how to ask her boyfriend to treat her more like a baby. I am thinking bitter chauvinistic thoughts as I sit between a pair of women giggling about murder. In my This American Life phase I thought of my headphones as a tool for crying with, as inevitably I would arrive at my destination striped with mascara and need to do some breathing exercises quickly by the sinks. Is it like this for everyone? When I see somebody on the bus singing heartily along to their playlist I think it might be, but other times I worry it points to a simpleness in my brain. I drown in these things.Maybe it’s because I’m so used to doing three things at a time, damping down the constant ache to click away, that the experience of listening properly is so overwhelming. Maybe it’s the relaxing meditation of a voice almost whispering, or the pace of a podcast, uncommon to a digital age. Maybe it’s that these stories mean I can never be alone, or maybe it’s the uncommon intimacy of having a story read to me. I read a lot of stories out loud, including one last week to a class of children, with a boy who, at the end, asked, “Will the postman be OK?” The story had not featured a postman I said “yes” with feeling.Every evening a bedtime story will provide some rhyming resolution to the day just gone, and then the lights are turned off, and then goodnight. I am returning the favour to myself, with a brisk Irish accent telling me what the trees looked like that warm day in September, a dry American writer crowbarring open my ideas of what a relationship is for, an Australian investigator who will not let it lie.

Then, when the mercury drops, we’re somehow shocked that the sun is setting at 4pm, our monthly budgets are desperately contorting themselves around Christmas obligations, and we’re spending 20-30 minutes every weekday morning in silent negotiations with every instinct inside us that’s demanding we stay cocooned up in bed as the working day approaches.I’m one of those ungrateful types who says silly things like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by late August, which is testament to this annual amnesia. Sure enough, when winter comes around, I’m obsessively looking for any remnant of spring and summer to warm my spirit as I wait for the clocks to go forward again.Sunday is my day to fuel up on enough cosiness to see me through five days of early starts and pitch-black evenings, so all food, entertainment and activities must be warming and mellow. Cooking shakshuka for breakfast means I can let the stove’s heat wash over me (an alternative to using even more energy on central heating) as I impatiently watch my red sweet peppers soften in the wok, waiting for the perfect moment to add first the passata (I’m fussy about tomato chunks) and then the eggs. I eat hurriedly, using hunks of toasted sourdough bread as cutlery, racing to get the warmth in me before heading out into the chilly air.I don’t go far, as I’m lucky to live over the road from the epicentre of cosiness, Columbia Road flower market. The trees that line my street have been stripped bare by winter, so the market’s weekly bloom feels like walking back into May and June, even if I am balled up in a fleece and thick jogging bottoms. Strolling down the alleys that lead from the main road to the market, the sound of buskers singing blues music creeps up on me, accompanied by clinking pint glasses and pub chatter. To my right, windows framing candlelit cafe tables draw me in, leading my eyes to racks of 1970s tableware, costume jewellery and plant pots that spill out from a higgledy-piggledy shop and on to the wonky paving slabs.After I finally accept there isn’t a place in my house for a crystal glass decanter – a decision I re-examine every time I pass this shop – I join the crowded flow of bodies heading to the flowers. Towering bamboo overshadows us for a brief moment, giving way to a flurry of colour that feels psychedelically incongruous in the grey, dead January chill. I walk through, watching out for bewildered jack russells and small children, to soak up the sea of bottle-green house plants and flamboyant bromeliads, inevitable roses and hundreds more I can’t name – some that look like hummingbirds, some that look like pineapples (but aren’t), fussy ones that I’d likely kill in a week, and hardy types I could hopefully neglect without guilt. Then I loop back, looking for something to take home.My choice is slightly limited as I usually go towards the end of trading, when the lifestyle influencers have stopped taking photos and the sellers, eager to avoid lugging home too many spare cheese plants, offer discounts. By this point you can get a couple of really great bunches of flowers for a fiver, so I try to play florist and work out which colours and shapes are going to go together. Now it’s been winter for a good few months, I’m drawn to flowers that make me feel like I have the sun on my face – pretty little purple flowers that you’d see in a British park in summer, and sweet, warm orange petals that conjure up the taste of Soleros.While the flower market is full of life and colour, it is still winter, and I’m still cold. I timed my central heating to come on 20 minutes before I get in, so warm air greets me as I push the front door open with my bum, to avoid crushing my bouquets. I place the flowers on the kitchen side, and begin cutting the stems with inadequate scissors, the mixture of hard work and warm radiators bringing feeling back to my cold fingers. I make a feeble arrangement and stick them in a vase that I use because it belonged to my nan, despite its irritating tendency to tip over. They’ll live by the window, which looks out on marketgoers clutching their huge, leafy houseplants and marching home in single file like leafcutter ants in scarves and coats.Coffee made, slippers on and the house toasty, I squish myself into a corner of the sofa and get under a blanket that’s been warming on my radiator. As I lazily watch Netflix (or binge Beyoncé live performance videos on YouTube if I’m home alone or with sympathetic friends), I look up at my new bunch of flowers poking out from behind my TV.

For me, it’s just a question of when.”With the Labour leadership battling to contain a wider split after the resignation of nine MPs last week:• London mayor Sadiq Khan is warning that the party’s response to antisemitism has precipitated a “collapse in trust” between Labour and the Jewish community• Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, are pushing Corbyn’s team to support a deal to secure a second referendum – with one of Britain’s biggest unions also backing the plan• One of Labour’s biggest former donors, Sir David Garrard, told the Observer he has already funded the Independent Group (TIG) of 11 MPs who quit last week• Senior figures are also calling for any attempts to trigger the reselection of MPs this year to be ruled out to help calm isions.The pressure on Corbyn to back a second referendum was increasing on Saturday night, as Tim Roache, general secretary of the Labour-affiliated GMB union, backed the Kyle-Wilson plan.“The clock is ticking and something needs to break the logjam in Westminster,” Roache said.“The prime minister refuses to budge, there is no genuine attempt to get consensus, and no deal would be an absolute economic disaster, so this needs to go back to the public.“The people must be the ones to decide whether Theresa May’s version of Brexit beats the deal we already have with Europe. If the prime minister is confident that her deal does the job, she doesn’t have anything to worry about.”In an online article for the Observer, Khan said that the last week had been “the most distressing and depressing of my 33 years in the party”, and that urgent action was needed to keep Labour together.“It is our responsibility to ensure that the Labour party emerges from these uncertain times ready to govern and able to attract those Members of Parliament who have left to return home,” he writes.“Over the last few years, it’s clear that Labour has been too slow at addressing the Jewish community’s concerns and at kicking out the minority of Labour members and supporters who think it is acceptable to use antisemitic tropes and abuse – both online and in local Labour meetings. This has led to a collapse in trust between Labour and the Jewish community.”His intervention comes as Garrard, who had donated about £1.5m to Labour since 2003, told the Observer that he had already started funding TIG. “I have watched, with ever-growing concern, the deterioration, especially over the past year, of the extent and nature of the naked antisemitism which has increased throughout the Labour party and its supporters, since Jeremy Corbyn and his cabal of revolutionaries took control of the Labour party which I had so admired and supported with commitment and enthusiasm.“From the very outset of Mr Corbyn’s leadership I had feared the ultra-Left MarxistSocialist nature of the Labour party’s new leadership and its supporters, all of which led me to conclude that a socialist republic for our nation was what these politicians intend.“I have observed the intimidation and the bullying that has become endemic within the party and its supporters for all to see, and it is therefore with a sense of actual relief and optimism that I’ve witnessed the emergence of these brave politicians who put country before party.“I am hopeful that there may yet be a bright outcome from the sadness and despair of what was once a proud and courageous Labour party. I’ve been asked whether I will financially support the new group. I have already done so.”The Labour leader and his team strongly deny any suggestion that they tolerate antisemitism.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, hit back at TIG in an article for the Observer, saying the group is “now the real barrier to change”.She added: “From what we have seen and heard so far, all that we know is they would continue Tory policies from endless privatisation to sky-high tuition fees.”Meanwhile, senior party figures are also calling on Corbyn and his leading allies to agree to delaying the process of reselecting MPs until after this year. Three party sources told the Observer that some of the leader’s allies were keen to start the process, which could lead to the deselection of sitting MPs. A Labour spokesperson said it was “categorically untrue” that any list of seats had been drawn up as part of the first wave of the reselection process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3b2f44d2f6760d9a288ccb83b8fc0118bc1f7e2/0_206_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b72b49868c66a289a3264b1b2786f396","title":"soviet vassal state jeremy hunt makes gaffe in slovenia","story":"UK foreign secretary criticised after statement displaying lack of awareness country was part of Non-Aligned Movement The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has incorrectly claimed Slovenia was a Soviet vassal state during his visit to Ljubljana to discuss the Brexit negotiations with his counterpart Miro Cerar.Slovenia was in fact the wealthiest state within the former Yugoslavia, which was outside the iron curtain and formed part of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).Yugoslavia had a chequered relationship with the Soviet Union. Its leader Josip Tito defied Moscow’s hegemony and promoted what he called independent roads to socialism.“This is my first visit to Slovenia as foreign secretary, not the first in my life, but my first in a professional capacity,” Hunt said. “And I’m really happy to be here, because as a fellow European country the UK is very proud of the transformation there has been in Slovenia over the last 30 years.“A really remarkable transformation from a Soviet vassal state to a modern European democracy, a member of the EU, a member of Nato, a country with a flourishing economy, growing its tourism year in, year out, and this is really an example of Europe at its best.”The former speaker of Slovenia’s national assembly Milan Brglez criticised Hunt for “arrogantly lecturing” his country and rebuked its own politicians for not picking up on the gaffe. He said they may not even have noticed the “insult”. “We have never been ‘the vassal state of the Soviet Union’,” he wrote on Facebook.“At a minimum what I expect from my representatives is that they will react immediately when someone insults the state and its citizens. And not that they are meekly silent, perhaps not even noticing the insult.”In a related gaffe reported by local media, the UK’s Slovenian embassy tweeted that Hunt was in the country to meet Karl Erjavec, when in fact he left his role as foreign secretary last year.Hunt is increasingly gaining a reputation for high-profile errors.

We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it wasn’t an easy decision for any of us,” Umunna said.“We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not recreate the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence.“As we embark on this new chapter, most importantly we want you to help us build a new movement, and we’re keen to hear from you. Join us, and help us forge a new, different kind of politics for Britain’s future.”TIG’s MPs all campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU, while Umunna has been a prominent supporter of a second referendum.The former shadow business secretary and Labour leadership contender has been described as the obvious candidate to lead TIG in the Commons, where the 11-strong group equals the Lib Dems in size and outnumbers the DUP by one.There has been continued speculation that more Labour and Tory MPs will quit and potentially join the new group in the coming days and weeks as Brexit comes to a head.The departures already mark the biggest parliamentary schism since the formation of the Social Democratic party in the 1980s.However, many of TIG’s MPs will face a huge challenge if they want to hold on to their seats in a future election.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and several members of his shadow cabinet staged a rally in the Tory breakaway Anna Soubry’s Broxtowe constituency on Saturday.The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said MPs who left Labour had “betrayed” their seats and would be defeated if elections were held.Fighting for seats in a general election will require significant funding, although TIG has already attracted support from major donors who have abandoned the main parties in recent months.Umunna told the Times on Saturday that the group had already raised “tens of thousands of pounds from several thousand small donors”.And on Sunday Garrard told the Observer: “I’ve been asked whether I will financially support the new group. I have already done so.”The property tycoon, who donated around £1.5m to Labour over a period of 15 years, left the party in protest at the leadership’s handling of the antisemitism row.The Pimlico Plumbers founder, Charlie Mullins, who previously donated to the Tories and then the Lib Dems, indicated to the Times on Saturday that he could also give TIG financial backing.“I believe that any money I put in to the Independent Group will be money well spent because I think Theresa May is destroying the economy,” he said.“This is about our children and grandchildren and the future of this country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27acfd990386e0d0bcec1015720bd872eae4619f/0_251_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1a73b799ffa9c57f6956a616ef92f1","title":"dinosaur fossils collectors museums price sale","story":"Leading US palaeontologists are calling for a worldwide halt to the sale of vertebrate dinosaur fossils. The booming market for specimens, driven by their popularity with wealthy private collectors, including Hollywood stars, is pushing up prices and putting them out of reach of museums and scientists, they say.While the art market is organised around brand-name artists, dinosaur sales are all about celebrity species, with a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton fetching up to $10m, although the velociraptor is the most prized. The price tag for a triceratops’s skull is $170,000 to $400,000, and a diplodocus is $570,000 to $1.1m. Last year a complete egg of an aepyornis maximus, otherwise known as an elephant bird, sold for $130,000 – roughly five times what it would have gone for a decade earlier.Jerry Smith, an expert in the evolution of freshwater fishes in the department of zoology at Michigan University, told the Observer: “When specimens go into a private home or collection, our understanding, interpretation or discovery of new information they contain will never reach the scientific community.”Last year the US Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology (SVP) called on the Parisian auction house Aguttes to cancel a sale inside the Eiffel tower that contained just one lot: a 29-foot-long dinosaur of a yet-to-be identified species. The winning bidder paid $2.3m for the piece.Executive members of the society drew attention to the claim that the winning bidder could name the species, calling that assertion “misleading because the naming of new species is governed by the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature”.“The sale of all fossils is inappropriate,” says Catherine Badgley, former president of the SVP, which represents more than 2,200 international palaeontologists. “Many, particularly vertebrate fossils, are rarely common, and it’s certainly not the case for dinosaurs. The commodification is in principle inappropriate because it motivates unscrupulous people.”As ARTnews magazine pointed out last week, we can thank Steven Spielberg’s 1993 film Jurassic Park for the surging dinosaur market. The initial phase peaked in 1997, just months after the film’s sequel, The Lost World, was released, when a 12m-long T rex named Sue was sold at Sotheby’s for a record-breaking $8.36m to the Field Museum in Chicago.But the interest has hardly abated. The recent Art Basel Miami included a special project called DeXtinction, organised by two mining companies, Avant Mining and Interprospekt, that included a 120 million-year-old mother and juvenile allosaur and a well-preserved dinosaur egg set from the Cretaceous period, 75 million years ago.According to the New York Post’s Page Six column, the exhibit drew the attention of Leonardo DiCaprio, who along with Nicolas Cage and Russell Crowe, has staked out a reputation as a collector.And that’s what alarms palaeontologists who fear not only the loss of scholarship but also the diminution of appreciation for the work that goes into discovery, excavation and reconstruction of a dinosaur skeleton as they become fashionable objects of home decor.Dinosaur fossil collection comes with risks. In 2013, the 67 million-year-old skull of a tyrannosaurus bataar bought by Nicolas Cage became the focus of an investigation into smuggling. Cage had bought it at an auction in California, beating DiCaprio with a $276,000 bid. It was later discovered that the skull was obtained from Eric Prokopi, a self-described “commercial palaeontologist” who had previously pleaded guilty to illegally importing fossils from Mongolia and China.The looted skull was ultimately returned to Mongolia.All of which still serves to alarm working palaeontologists, who express concern that institutions are being priced out of the market and important specimens lost to private collections. Badgley points to specimens dug from the Green River Formation in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, which has some of the earliest bataar fossil specimens known. “Bat fossils overall are extremely rare, and even if half from this really early period are going into private collections, then that’s an enormous amount of really important information that’s being lost,” she says.Badgley’s message to collectors, then, is simple: collect by all means but steer clear of unique specimens.“There isn’t a strong link between expensive trophy specimens and an increase in the science of palaeontology. If anything, they’re seen more for their rarity and economic value than for their scientific information. It’s not necessary for people to become interested in palaeontology by having a unique specimen that’s theirs and theirs alone.”In her experience, she says, “people are often just as happy with something that’s very common”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d6950a67a241afdc294efa2c79f0903fc3f59b/0_80_2571_1543/master/2571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=863a18ab22df5ae135746aa079ddedb6","title":"chris eubank jr james degale boxing","story":"• Eubank Jr wins by 114-112, 115-112, 117-109• DeGale ‘pretty sure’ he will now call time on his careerChris Eubank Jr finally emerged from his father’s suffocating cloak on Saturday night to send two-time world champion James DeGale hurtling towards retirement and setting his own career on what could be an irresistible upward curve.The judges saw it 114-112 115-112, 117-109, to hand 29-year-old Eubank the IBO’s super-middleweight title, and, while the third score looked unkind, there could be no arguing with the result.Eubank said, “Now I’m going for all the other belts in the super-middleweight ision. I knew he was going to use his boxing ability. I was working on my jab. He’s a very slick southpaw. The game plan worked, smart pressure. I didn’t get too much ahead of myself. I dominated pretty much every single every round. I believe I proved the doubters wrong tonight. They said I was going to get my head jabbed off. It was the most important fight of my career. He didn’t quit, man enough to stay in the ring.”DeGale, who needed an operation to repair his right shoulder, moved comfortably at the start, his southpaw jab busy and precise, although a trickle of blood at the edge of his left eye encouraged Eubank.If he sensed a window opening, Eubank went through it straight away. A notoriously slow starter, he was armed now with the fresh instructions of the American Nate Vasquez, and, swarming forward, caught his retreating opponent with a stream of solid head shots to force a count midway through the second round.The counter-puncher DeGale had been out-counter-punched and resorted to lunging under Eubank’s quicker leads and cocked right hand. “You’ve got to use your feet,” his trainer Jim McDonnell told him before the start of the fourth, and a couple of long lefts – one cutting Eubank’s left eye – got him back in the argument, despite getting caught near the bell.“Let your hands go,” Vasquez advised Eubank, but his feet did not dance for him to set up the openings and it was the Londoner who worked harder to take the fifth. Eubank’s energy levels rose at the halfway point and he rocked DeGale in centre ring to edge the sixth. Just as he appeared to be falling behind, DeGale came to life in the seventh, only to lose concentration again.The younger man now looked dominant for longer stretches and the normally elusive Degale was stopping more than his share of punches, although stop-start nature of the contest did not make for a great spectacle.DeGale poked out his tongue at the end of each round but did not often enough follow the gesture with anything substantial, his contributions speculative single-shot assaults. By most estimates, DeGale entered the championship rounds in deficit – and the spark remained missing, with his right eye leaking blood again. His balance and judgment had deserted him, replaced by desperation. A left hook disorientated him, and a follow-up salvo cost him another count.The mission had morphed from grim to forlorn for DeGale. Eubank smelled blood in every way, and stalked his man to good effect before shoulder-charging him to the canvas, which cost him a point in the 11th round. It hardly mattered. His prey was struggling on unreliable legs now, needing a knockout and surely doubting it would come. It didn’t.Another left rattled DeGale’s teeth in the 12 but pride kept him upright. It was pretty much all he had left at the end.On an interesting undercard Rio Olympic silver-medallist Joe “Juggernaut” Joyce stopped the (briefly) former world heavyweight title-holder, Bermane Stiverne, in the sixth round to put himself in the frame for a shot at the WBA’s “regular” heavyweight title, owned by Manuel Charr.A polite athlete who might more appropriately be called Gentleman Joe, Joyce was merciless as he doused the ambitions of the 40-year-old Stiverne, who lasted less than a minute in his previous outing, two Novembers ago against Deontay Wilder.Joyce and Stiverne sparred in America several years ago and mutual resentment simmered during the week, the visitor boasting that seven months of preparation had brought him to another peak, although entering the ring at a career-heaviest 19st 5lb hardly made him a poster boy for his gym. The argument that mattered was clean and conclusive.Throwing more punches than a middleweight, Joyce battered Stiverne to a standstill with jabs and crosses that flowed like honey. Down in the third, Stiverne took his licks but looked relieved to be rescued on his feet, mouth open, blood flowing, senses dazzled.Joyce – who prepared alongside Gennady Golovkin at altitude in Big Bear, California - does not have the one-punch power of Wilder, the pure skill of Tyson Fury or the all-round excellence of his friend, Anthony Joshua, but said ringside, “I’ve sparred them all but Wilder, and I think I’m close to that level.”He is still raw, and a little robotic, but the Juggernaut has the priceless qualities of determination and self-belief. And, while he will be held in a queue for a little while yet at the highest level, he is capable of taking out the 34-year-old Charr.Earlier, Lee Selby had to box through a crimson haze for the second time in his career, outpointing Omar Douglas, an uncompromising customer from Wilmington, Delaware, who seemed to think he could use his head as a glove – and, disgracefully, escaped censure.Selby, moving up two isions to lightweight, won 116-112, 116-112, 116-114, and ownership of the IBF’s Inter-continental belt insinuates him in discussions for a shot at the federation’s full champion, Richard Commey. Otherwise, he could hunt down Anthony Crolla, whose own late-career ambitions will be tested to the limit in Los Angeles on 12 April against the ision’s supreme technician, Vasiliy Lomachenko, who owns the WBA and WBO titles.On his best nights, of which there have been many, Selby always looked relaxed performing his magic. But his return after losing his IFF featherweight title to Josh Warrington last May was a bloody affair, and he did well to hold his concentration. Sliced badly around his left eye in round two, and late across his right eyebrow, he was a crimson mess at the finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/243c4f41ba2c5d648f2b3f9c193c815f99bb0b8e/0_30_4944_2967/master/4944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5da4f0d85d0bd2b8d1a9f845d1bf3b6","title":"cricket world cup mcfly love island cool free inflatables influencers","story":"Admiral Jellicoe probably wouldn’t have been a big advocate for one-day cricket. In the first world war, the commander of the British fleet gained a reputation for a strictly defensive style of play, the kind of dead-batting that determined the Battle of Jutland was only ever going to end in a draw. Winston Churchill did, after all, describe him as “the one man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon”. Jellicoe couldn’t afford a mid‑innings collapse.He was there this past week, gazing on as Nelson’s Column was transformed into the middle stump of a cricket wicket by the combined magic of giant inflatables and low-angle photography. If he seemed to look down his nose at Sir Alastair Cook posing next to McFly’s Harry Judd, it was only because they’d mounted his plinth so high.The event announcing 100 days to the start of the Cricket World Cup was one of those publicity stunts now written into the marketing plan of every international tournament: a well-meaning attempt to nudge a national collective consciousness that is understandably preoccupied. It’s hard to feel the urgency of a 100-day countdown to an opener against South Africa at the Oval when we’ve only 33 left till Brexit. Has anyone even checked Britain’s leather and willow stockpiles?This isn’t the first attempt to Make Cricket Cool Again, and it won’t be the last. This one had Chris Hughes from Love Island, “a social-media influencer” and IRL friend of Jonny Bairstow (they met at a VIP day at Ascot, where Chris was influencing). He talked about the Cotswolds club he plays for, and fended off questions about his romance with Little Mix’s Jesy Nelson. “It’s just so refreshing when it’s private,” said the star of the nation’s most‑watched reality dating show. “Half the time things that are said aren’t even true, but people are very easily influenced by what they read.” You’d presume this was good news for Hughes, and by extension for cricket.But even Hughes can only do so much for a sport that made the fatal decision, in December 2004, to cut itself off from the mainstream by removing itself from terrestrial television. He struggles even to convince his celeb friends to give it a watch. “People in my industry don’t really get cricket,” said Hughes, a little sadly. “It’s not like football.”Caprice was joined in her international diplomacy by Mark Little (Joe Mangel of Neighbours) and the cast of Casualty. There was, at least, some synergy between a group of emergency workers fighting their way through a sequence of disastrous accidents and England’s ’99 campaign. It had begun with a player dispute over pay and ended in their ejection before the Super Six stages, the day before Dave Stewart’s official tournament song, All Over The World, was released.England have learned a lot in the two decades since that tournament: evidently, since they are now the best one-day side in the world. “We didn’t take it seriously enough,” was Nasser Hussain’s judgment, as he stood in the shadow of Nelson. “It’s only been in the last four years – with Morgan, Strauss, Bayliss – that we have done.”“England have always been looking to catch up with the rest of the world,” agreed James Anderson, “and at the minute England are setting that bar.”It is a near certainty that England will put on a far better show for the public this summer than they did 20 years ago. Cricket aside, Britain has discovered that it can be rather good at hosting global sporting tournaments and the presence of a number of green‑track suited “Cricketeers” in Trafalgar Square brought back comforting memories of London 2012 and its army of smiling helpers. Perhaps this year will finally lay to rest the embarrassing memories of 1999’s opening ceremony at Lord’s, with its inaudible speech from Tony Blair and its damp fizzle of fireworks, which came to serve as a lasting metaphor for England’s performance.What English cricket has been slower to learn, however, is that reaching new audiences (the stated aim of the Hundred, for instance) is not the same as making cricket cool. Or that cool itself is not instantly transferable from those with a big Insta-following. Cricket has only ever been cool to the wider public when its players have done cool things on the field, and been seen to do them – as in 1981, when Ian Botham became a pin-up, or 2005, when Freddie Flintoff won the nation’s hearts in what we knew then would be the final live series before England’s cricketers became invisible, hidden from view behind Sky’s paywall.This week it was Swann who had the best answer, when asked how the game could break through to a new audience, and capture the nation’s attention. “I think,” he said, “that winning the World Cup is a very good way of doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de80ae67a91bddbbcde4909ec05cd482e93d663/0_133_5420_3252/master/5420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ebbcc8b524e153ca5d287e623dcdf1","title":"facebook app data leaks","story":"Facebook is battling fresh controversy on both sides of the Atlantic amid claims that it has been receiving highly personal data from third-party apps.The swirl of bad news around the company comes after its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was criticised for meeting the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, having refused to appear before an influential parliamentary committee in Westminster.The meeting came amid speculation that the government may soon publish a white paper potentially paving the way for an independent social media regulator.But the Observer has been told that a row is brewing over how the regulator should be funded. A proposal to hit the social media companies with a levy has alarmed some in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) who want to encourage tech investment in the UK. Others believe the levy should be applied to a broader range of tech firms, including the likes of Amazon. There are also questions over whether the media regulator, Ofcom, should oversee the new regulator or whether it should stand alone.On Friday, a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Facebook can receive information from numerous apps even if, in some cases, the user does not have a Facebook account. Of more than 70 popular apps tested by the Journal, it found at least 11 sent potentially sensitive information to Facebook.These included the Flo Period \u0026amp Ovulation Tracker, which reportedly shared with Facebook when users were having their periods or when they were trying to become pregnant. Facebook said that it required apps to tell users what information was shared with it and that it “prohibits app developers from sending us sensitive data”.New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, called on its departments of state and financial services to “immediately investigate” what he called a clear invasion of consumer privacy. Last week, the UK parliament’s DCMS committee issued a scathing report calling for tougher privacy rules for Facebook and other tech firms. Zuckerberg has rejected the committee’s requests for him to appear before it. But last week he met Wright at his company’s Silicon Valley HQ to discuss tackling harmful online content.“There is a good understanding that the UK government wants to keep its citizens safe online and will be putting in place structures that no longer rely on self-regulation,” Wright said afterwards.But Labour MP Ian Lucas, a member of the committee, was critical of the meeting. “I too would like to meet Mark Zuckerberg, but not for a chat – to ask real questions about all the issues we’ve raised,” Lucas said. “We have a lot of questions. I accept that Jeremy Wright needs to speak to the tech giants but I think it’s a question of the tone he adopts.“The thing about Jeremy Wright is that he’s not really going to say boo to a goose.”Criticisms of Facebook’s attitude towards its users’ privacy exploded a year ago following revelations in the Observer that the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the data of some 87 million of its users without consent.Meanwhile documents posted online on Friday have raised further privacy questions. About 60 pages of unedited exhibits from a lawsuit between Facebook and Six4Three, an app developer, were posted anonymously on the GitHub site.Facebook responded in a statement: “Like the other documents that were cherrypicked and released in violation of a court order last year, these by design tell one side of a story and omit important context.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca216418ac3b9e8506aeffc16a557cc7798d4679/0_561_3750_2249/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b440bf07b763a988c3eaa82a7680d46e","title":"stromer st3 electric bike part bicycle part rocket booster","story":"The Stromer ST3 pedal electric cycle is a phenomenal ride – between screaming exhilaration and abject terrorStromer ST3 electric bikePrice £6,690, urbanebikesTop speed 45kmhWeight 29kgRange up to 100 milesBattery 983WhRecharge 6 hoursIf you are a cyclist, look away now. This review is not for you. If, however, you are a motorist who is open to the idea of spending less time in your car (for the health of yourself and the planet, but probably not your wallet – this is a very expensive bike), then you might be interested to meet the Stromer. It’s a phenomenally fast, dizzyingly innovative and dangerously addictive ride that’s part bicycle and part rocket booster. At the end of my week testing it I couldn’t decide whether I was relieved to hand it back or if I’d ever want to ride my normal bike again.The game-changing brand – which I find impossible not to call Stormer – was founded in 2009 by Thomas Binggeli, and opened the doors to its solar-powered, state-of-the-art factory in Oerwangen, near Bern, in 2013. From the off, Stromer positioned its electric bike as a car-alternative (maybe that should be a “carlternative”). It wasn’t interested in wooing cyclists into abandoning their traditional steel steeds, it wanted to help motorists get to the office on vehicles which were not filthy fume-spewers. To make the point, Stromer uses taglines like: “Because the Swiss don’t build cars” and the “Swiss Driving Experience” to describe its bikes – which makes them sound like Switzerland’s answer to BMW and its famous claim to be the: “ultimate driving machine”. The level of ingenious technology on display makes me think it would be more accurate to call the Stromer “Switzerland’s two-wheeled Tesla.” And why not? Millions of us commute relatively short journeys to work – a trip of 15 miles or more is totally achievable on the Stromer, and the more people who get out of their cars, the less pollution and congestion there will be on our roads and in our cities.The bike is classed as an S-pedelec. Pedelic is shorthand for “pedal electric cycle” or e-bike, and the “S” stands for speed, so these bikes are often also called speed-pedelecs. This may sound a little bureaucratic, but currently the law states that e-bikes in the UK must be pedal assisted and not throttle-based, they must have a power output of 250W or less, and the speed limit for assistance must be 25kmh. Speed-pedelecs, however, can travel at up to 45kmh. For those not familiar with cycling, that’s about twice the average commute speed. The average overall speed of riders in the Tour de France is about 40kmh. So, unless you are very experienced or racing, it’s a level of velocity that sets you oscillating between screaming exhilaration and abject terror.It won’t surprise you, therefore, to learn that S-pedelecs are legally classed as mopeds. You have to have a driving licence or take a CBT to ride one. The bike has to be registered, taxed and insured, and you have to wear the correct safety equipment. This means the Stromer has a number plate and you have to wear a crash helmet – which feels very weird. It also means you can’t use cycle lanes and have to stay out of some bus lanes. This is a long way from ideal and left me, for one, feeling exposed and vulnerable – the exact opposite of what I want to feel when I’m on two wheels.But, and it’s a huge and delirious but, the Stromer is an astonishing ride. The power is instant. Turn the pedals and it arrives in a giant swoosh of momentum. The 983Wh battery has one of the largest capacities of any e-bike. To minimize clutter, all the tech is neatly integrated. The touch display on the top tube connects to an app and you can control all aspects of your ride from your phone, from battery life to theft protection and even scheduled maintenance. On the handlebars there are little rubbery buttons allowing you to control the lights and click through the three torque-assist levels. The bike has fixed lights. You can dip the front one and the rear one also acts as a brake light. It’s all very clever. What’s not so clever is that the bike is sold as a commuter solution, when what it craves is the uphill thrill of an open mountain road.Buy a new car today and you’ll find yourself actively assisted on the road by a host of intelligent vehicle aids, from clever self-parking systems to automatic braking and even dynamic cruise control.One of the most popular of these new gadgets is the Lane-Keeping Aid. This uses a range of front-mounted cameras to scan the road markings ahead and then it actively supports you by ‘nudging’ the steering wheel in the correct direction to stop you inadvertently straying out of your lane. It’s a useful piece of kit that helps keep us all safer on the road.Now the engineers over at Ford have started wondering if the same technology could be used to make other areas of our life more harmonious. And they hit upon the Lane-Keeping Bed. And for anybody who shares a mattress with a nocturnal space invader or sneaky cover snatcher, this could be a way of giving you an unbroken night’s sleep.Ford’s engineers have built a prototype bed that uses pressure sensors to detect when a heavy sleeper is straying from their side of the bed. The system then triggers an integrated and totally silent conveyor belt to gently tip them back to their side.

Outside St Moritz train station, lights twinkle, snow begins to fall and everywhere is soft, crystalline white. It looks magical, yet it’s torture for one of us. I should have known that taking a ski addict to Switzerland for a no-ski break would be problematic, especially if the ski addict in question happens to be my temperamental teenage son.“You knew the deal before we came. It’s hardly a deprivation,” I say, watching liveried chauffeurs holding tiny gold placards bearing names: Madame Petrov, Monsieur Felipe. Daimlers purr, waiting to whisk guests to opulent hotels further up the mountainIt wasn’t my intention to drop in on the Alpine playground of the super rich. I wanted to head straight for La Chaux-de-Fonds, the city designed by watch-makers and much admired by Karl Marx, via one of Europe’s most scenic rail trips, the Glacier Express. But in the spirit of balance and contrast, first we stay at one of St Moritz’s oldest hotels, the Kulm. In its fin-de-siecle foyer, chandeliers sparkle, log fires blaze and It girls drip in Fendi fur. It is like walking into the back pages of Hola!“We have a six-course tasting menu booked for you in the grand restaurant for 7pm,” says the lady at reception. My son Louis is perkier by the minute. Strangely his mood darkens when we are shown our room, complete with wrap around views of the Alps.“I can’t believe it,” he fumes, pacing the marbled bathroom. “People have been living like this all along and I never knew. Now I can’t enjoy anywhere else.”“And that’s the problem with coming to places like this,” I say. “You feel either moral outrage or envy. Neither makes you happy. It’s better just not to know.” But Louis isn’t listening. He is distracted by the in-house video on the TV. “Mum, look, you can hire a mountain for a day. It’s only £4,000. Can we come back?”At supper, the waiter hovers while Louis eyes up the wine menu where bottles start at around £75. “I know it’s not a question you hear very often,” I say. “But what’s your cheapest glass of house red?” “House?” the waiter repeats, baffled. The next morning, we head for the ice-skating rink, owned by the Kulm but open to the public. My instructor is charming and patient, holding my hands while I grit my teeth and try to forget about the last time I went ice skating 20 years ago and broke my ankle. She offers to take Louis nighttime skiing – a Friday tradition where for less than £20 you can enjoy Switzerland’s longest floodlit slope till 1am. He’s thrilled to get the chance to ski while I enjoy the outdoor infinity pool in peace. Later in reception, I hear an over-confident English accent: “My son is still on the slopes. I’m afraid we’ll be a little late for the country club.” I’m horrified to realise it is me. Time to go, before I start enquiring about mountain rentals.Early next morning, we board the Glacier Express, the world’s slowest express train that has been running between St Moritz and Zermatt since 1930. It snows heavily the day we travel and much of the time we emerge from the darkness of each tunnel (there are 91 of them) into blinding white fog. But when it does clear, the scenery is spectacular. We enjoy a three-course lunch at our table as the train carves its way through the Oberalp Pass (2,033 metres above sea level) with its glaciers and peaks, then on through the Nikolai Valley, the deepest in Switzerland, arriving at Zermatt eight hours later. The next morning we board a train to La Chaux-de-Fonds, in the Jura mountains, and close to the French border.If there is anywhere in Europe, let alone Switzerland, that is less like St Moritz in spirit, it’s hard to think of it. While St Moritz’s raison d’être is leisure for the super rich, La Chaux-de-Fonds is its polar opposite, created as a socialist antidote to all that glitz and privilege. Home of modern watch-making, the town prized industry and enterprise above all else. In 1794 a fire destroyed most of the buildings and, inspired by the radicalism of the French revolution, it was redesigned by the workers for the workers. Equality was built into the new city brick by brick. They chose not to have a civic centre given over to grand squares and palaces where the elite could parade their wealth and the poor would feel excluded.The city is built in a series of grids, its layout like a chess board streets were designed so workers and managers lived in close proximity, next to their workshops, with no neighbourhoods for the rich and ghettos for the poor. The boulevards are wide, allowing light to pour into the workshops so the watch-makers could work more efficiently. As a social experiment it was a resounding success Marx described the town as “la grande manufacture” in Das Kapital. The craft of watch-making thrived and prospered well into the 20th century, surviving the quartz revolution of the 1970s – even today La Chaux-de-Fonds is home to the workshops or headquarters of Rolex, Patek Philippe, Zenith, Tissot and Omega, many of which were founded here.The city is also home to the granddaddy of modernism, Le Corbusier, born here in 1887. In a snowy suburb overlooking the town, La Maison Blanche is a modernist gem built in 1912, and all the values that inspired the town are here in his design. Open-plan spaces for work as well as living, floor-to-ceiling windows so each room is flooded with light and, above all, the idea that everyone should be able to enjoy where they live. That night we stay at Grand Hôtel Les Endroits, a hotel on the edge of town where we we have our best meal so far, the food more French than Swiss, with shaved truffles baked with potatoes and cream, followed by chocolate patisserie.Our final morning is spent at a watch tutorial where, with the help of watch-maker Sebastian, a powerful microscope and some tweezers, we try to attach both watch hands to its face. After an hour of intense concentration, we manage to assemble a watch that keeps time. “Satisfying work isn’t it?” says Sebastian, as Louis tries it on his wrist. “I guess,” he says, studying it. “So how much would it cost to take it home?” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

After a few rocky years, she’s now at Radio 2 and has written a memoir about her rural childhoodShortly after I meet Sara Cox she wriggles under a sofa where her two dogs are trying to eat something they shouldn’t, but carries on talking in a muffled voice, apparently perfectly happy to continue the interview from the jaws of a slobbering animal. Given that we’re in a London photo studio, I could be slightly surprised by a TV and radio presenter who’s just had her hair and makeup done writhing on the floor, but as I’ve read her new memoir, Till the Cows Come Home, I’m not. And since I’ve also been listening to her brand new drivetime show on Radio 2, where she regales listeners with stories such as the time she accidentally took her daughter’s swimming costume to the pool – it turned out to be age 10, not size 10 – but stuffed herself into it to save a wasted journey, this seems perfectly normal. “I don’t know if you’ve seen a pork loin with string around it in the supermarket? I’ll just leave that thought there,” as she said on air.If you’re a woman who came of age in 1990s Britain, watching Sara Cox and her best friend Zoe Ball take over the media, presenting radio and TV shows with witty, breathless, irreverent chat, it is immensely difficult not to love her. We were gripped, watching the pair of them adventure their way on to the front page of the tabloids with a drink in one hand and a male conquest in the other – it was a whole new way of being female in public life. And while Ball was from a TV family, Coxy was straight out of working-class Bolton, having only got into media after being scouted for a bit of teenage modelling, which then led to co-hosting The Girlie Show when they found out she could talk.Yet her memoir is not a tell-all of those Met Bar years, when the stars of 1990s London all seemed to squeeze into one small drinking hole on Park Lane, but in fact the story of the previous 20, when she grew up the youngest of five children on a 40-acre tenanted farm in Lancashire. The book is like a big warm hug, full of local characters and misadventures, as well as hard graft and slaughter, with her parents working in haulage, cleaning and pubs, as well as on the farm. It’s also almost a work of social history, despite its author being only in her 40s. I mean, perhaps there are still children who dress in chiffon costumes on Bolton carnival floats while the mams swig vodka from ornamental teacups and the confused float driver accidentally hurtles them all off down a dual carriageway, and perhaps there are still English children who herd escaped cattle while dressed in a nightie and wellies, or swap eggs for shotguns, or are allowed to walk their own dog home when it breaks into the school again, all without a mobile phone in sight. But I doubt it.Coxy has written this partly as a love letter to her parents and grandparents, and so her three well-spoken children, with their very different London lives, will know where they come from. Her eldest, 14-year-old Lola, is a big reader who “just thinks it’s so mega that there’s a book with my name on it. But my biggest fear,” she says, “is that people are going to go, what makes Sara Cox think that she can write a book? Who does she think she is?”Given that she has a clear way with words and used to lie in her bunk bed reading Shakespeare aloud with her sister, I don’t think it’s her lyricism that’s in doubt. (In the book she describes a teenage outfit of hers “like Bet Lynch after she’d been run over by a council gritter”.) But the book’s publication has only happened to coincide with her big new job on Radio 2 – it was planned long before, when she wasn’t sure what was going on in her career. In fact, when her third child, Renee, was a baby, seven years ago, Coxy says she felt “like the squirrel with the nut at the start of Ice Age, trying to cling on to the ledge of my career. I feel like I’ve got to the top of a mountain now, like I’ve conquered it. But I’ve been working towards this for so long I’m like, crikey, God, I’ve got it! Don’t dick it up!”During the wilderness years, she would sometimes get in a London black cab and the driver would say, “Oi, Coxy, you still on the radio?” and she’d steel herself to reply, “Yes, every Saturday night at 10pm.” She got very good at body combat workouts – “Obviously I had a lot of anger.” (She favours pilates and cycling into work nowadays.) It was Davina McCall who rescued her, even though they weren’t close then, because Davina is apparently the last person in England who can actually use a phone.“The thing with Davina is, right, if you text her, she’ll fucking ring you. Which is really scary, because sometimes you just want to be lazy and chicken and say, “I’m feeling really shit about myself,” and you want just a nice text and some emojis back. But I think because of what she’s been through, Davina will make you confront how you’re feeling, and so you’re staring at her number coming up – and I call her Dave on my phone so it says DAVE RINGING – and you’re like, oh God…”Davina put Coxy on to a life coach called Michael Heppell. He made her work on an exercise where you imagine segments of a beach ball as the fundamental aspects of your life. She told him about her husband, Ben Cyzer, who works in digital advertising. “All my happiness and support with the kids and Ben was all fully inflated,” she says. (She was married before, to the DJ Jon Carter, with whom she had her first child, “and everybody who’s been through one marriage knows that, when it works a second time, you’re just so grateful. Ben is amazing and hilarious and he’s my other half, he’s my second chance.”) But the rest of her beach ball “was like somebody had taken a steak knife to it. And then I realised that, as much as I’m ambitious and a career woman, I’d happily take that, my personal side being fully inflated, rather than being really unhappy at home but a billionaire at work.”I wonder if her fear has its roots in the bullying she suffered at school, where two girls humiliated and hurt her on a daily basis. She writes that she’d like to travel back in time “to tell the 12-year-old me to retaliate. To push back. I was a strong girl from lugging buckets of water and bales of hay and probably could’ve battered them. But I didn’t.” (Of course, this being her, never more than two seconds from a joke, she then adds: “While I was at it, I’d also tell myself to maybe rethink the spiral perms.”)Yet, in a delicious twist of fate, the chief bully decided to text into the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show years later, when Coxy was the presenter, asking for a “shout-out”. “She got her shout-out all right,” she writes, in a rare flash-forward to the noughties, “though not the one she was expecting”. She tells me that she wouldn’t do it now. “I’d be much more grown up. But it was still much more raw then. I remember feeling myself just grow in stature and power, that very second – it was like in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid. I can’t remember what I said, but I was horrible.”That boldness would continue, with Sara Cox always taking things a little further than other BBC presenters. She got an official reprimand for wishing the Queen Mother a happy 100th birthday with, “Ah, she smells of wee, but we all love her.” (“I can’t talk about that, Sophie, please don’t,” she says, swallowing a guilty laugh. “They might have forgotten about it.”) I tell her I remember her playing Murder on the Dancefloor by Sophie Ellis-Bextor and then idly asking listeners to phone in with how they would murder that singer on the dancefloor. She is comically appalled, says it didn’t happen, then admits it probably did.“I mean, I remember very little,” she says. In fact, this is why she didn’t write the Met Bar memoir – she says she has forgotten most of it, and that what remains would involve “a lot of back and forth with lawyers, and a lot of people hating me. I think my peak 90s moment was posing on a Harley-Davidson outside the Met Bar with Wyclef Jean. There was a lot of Donna Air and the Appleton sisters and hanging out in Essex with the Prodigy and stuff. And Zoe, of course. But I’ve got no interest in writing that at all and I don’t think anyone would want to read it apart from you.”I am so far in disagreement I’m on the verge of offering to write it myself. Tell us what the Met Bar was like, at least.“Really small, with a dancefloor about the size of a Jacob’s cream cracker. I did dance in there, but it was more about talking loudly over each other and wanging on and general misbehaviour. Maybe you’d get Kate Moss occasionally. And it was part of the politan Hotel so you’d also get a few confused businessmen from Stuttgart over for a conference, who were probably thinking: ‘What the fuck are these 20-odd year olds doing running around and screeching?’ But it’s kind of to be celebrated. No bugger bothers to invite me to anything nowadays, because I’m like: ‘Will it be done by eight? Is it seated?’”And thus she has found her perfect home at Radio 2, the new headquarters of people who used to be cool but now enjoy a comfortable chair. Since January, Zoe Ball has presented the breakfast show and Sara Cox the drivetime one from 5-7pm (Steve Wright and Jo Whiley are also on the daily schedule – it’s like the whole of Radio 1 shifted across.) “We’ve totally Benjamin Buttoned the entire nation and sent them back to their teens,” she says happily. (If there was a Nobel Prize for the rapid deployment of pop culture allegories, Coxy would be its laureate.) “The first week of the show was – babies’ births and one of my marriages aside – the happiest week of my life.”But are there still people in her world who think they’re a bit edgy, who refuse to make the leap to Radio 2?“Oh yes, and I’ve had a few tweets from people saying: ‘OK, I’ve made the leap, you’ve got me now,’ but also from people saying they need a Radio 1.5, you know, like a panda-breeding programme where we slowly introduce them to Radio 2. But I don’t think we need it now because Radio 2 already sounds quite different from a couple of months ago.”A music team decides the playlist, “but I’ve got one of their mobile numbers now, which may or may not be good for him, because suddenly I’ll text saying: ‘Please can I play the KLF with Tammy Wynette?’ and he’ll go: “Oh Christ, OK then.’ But they’ve got a tough job to do because there are so many decades of amazing music out there. If it was up to me I’d play Beyoncé, Whitney and Minnie Riperton – just my birthing CD.”Did she use the same birthing CD for all three babies, I wonder. “Well, I swapped husbands between,” she replies breezily, “so I thought it deserved a remix at least.”With advice like this – change your birthing CD when you change your husband – she could have filled another sort of book altogether, since other publishers have asked her to write “a wacky mum’s handbook about how to be a bit crap at being a mum”. She makes a face. “I’m not a big fan of those ‘I’ve pushed a baby through my cervix so pass me my laptop, I’m now an expert and I’m going to do a clothing range as well’ types. I hate that kind of celebby advice book. Loads of women have had babies, love, you’re not unique – there’s one right now, crowning.”At the risk of sounding as cheesy as those publishers, I am curious about how she made her second marriage work. “We like being nice to each other and I think that’s really important in a marriage. You want to make each other happy and you want to do nice things for each other, whether it’s, you know, making a brew or being the ones to go and put the dogs away. Every weekend, he’s schlepping around, picking up the kids, driving them places and he doesn’t begrudge it, and that is just so attractive in a man. He never fails to step up.”Besides which, their bedroom is arranged so Ben sleeps nearest the door, “which was accidental, but actually it’s brilliant because the kids get to him first if they wake up in the night. He’s the speedbump they have to get over to get to me.”She still dreams of returning to the countryside, but he’s a born Londoner and they love their house in Willesden too much. Some years ago she walked out of a trendy London hairdressers, only to spot a big old lorry trying to navigate a tight bend in Fitzrovia. Having spent every school holiday accompanying her dad on his delivery wagon (where they would listen in hushed reverence to Radio 2), she found herself directing this driver, using hand signals, shouting out, “To me, to me, whoa,” until she’d got him round the corner. “It never leaves you. I take these tiny dogs for a walk but, in my head, I’m getting a horse in from the field. I’m always trying to get back towards some sort of farm-type life. Always trying to swim upstream.”In this extract from her book, Sara Cox comes down to earth with a bang“Just jump!” So I did. It didn’t go well. Let me explain. I was perched on the end of the loft platform in the barn on the farm where we lived. It was summer, just before haymaking when all the lovely fresh hay would be brought in by an army of pals and helpers, fuelled by tea.Now, though, the barn was almost empty save for a few old bales on the dusty floor and a pile of half a dozen or so right next to the loft. These were to be my crash mat. All I had to do was launch myself from my position and push away from the wall, gliding majestically on to the scratchy landing below. It was a drop of perhaps 8ft, but to my seven-year-old mind the chasm below might as well have been the Grand Canyon. Or, seeing as this was Bolton, the “Reet Grand Canyon”.My older sister Yvonne was the one encouraging me to jump. I was grateful that she was playing with me so I was keen to impress. As the youngest of five I was used to being a walking, talking booby prize to my older siblings. An unwelcome addition.Back then I was half girl, half forehead – a trait that was a target for classmates, both figuratively, with a plethora of nicknames (slaphead, fivehead, fodder), and literally, as they’d heartily slap it while running past, high-fiving my fivehead. So the fact my sister had agreed to hang out with me and my forehead was a big deal. Sure, the downside was she wanted me to jump to certain death for her own amusement, but at least I’d die knowing I wasn’t a chicken.I took a deep breath. I jumped. I didn’t push away from the platform, though, I sort of nudged my bottom over the edge, so instead of springing away from the wall I slid down it like a blob of custard dripping down a kitchen tile.In fact, I stuck so closely to the wall that I didn’t even make it on to the bales below but tumbled between them and the wall, like a lost mitten down the back of a radiator. I looked up to see my sister’s horrified face frozen in a grimace – part sympathy, part worry in case I grassed her up to Mum.The good news was I didn’t die. The only evidence of my misjudged jump was the two red raw tramlines down my back that made me look like I’d been mowed down by a joyrider in a Silver Cross pram.Extracted from Till the Cows Come Home (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £18.99).

There were injuries on both sides of the crossing, with Colombian authorities reporting at least 285 wounded.In the south, opposition activists claimed aid had reached Venezuela, but although two trucks did leave Brazil they stopped just a few metres inside the border, a national guard checkpoint between them and any possible recipients.Beyond the security forces was the town of Santa Elena de Uairén, which saw the worst of the violence, with both pro-government armed gangs and national guard members taking to the streets to try and disperse opposition supporters.At least four people were killed and 18 injured by gunfire, according to campaign group Foro Penal, and the town’s hospital was overwhelmed by the influx of dead and injured.The first casualty of the aid delivery attempt had come in the same area on Friday, when a military convoy opened fire on indigenous protesters.Humanitarian aid is much-needed in a country racked by hunger, hyperinflation and food shortages. But opposition leaders also hope their attempt to deliver supplies will undermine Maduro and encourage defections from security forces that have largely remained loyal to Caracas.As violence raged along the borders, Maduro addressed a rally in the capital, insisting he was “stronger than ever” and calling volunteers trying to ship aid “traitors”.He denounced the food and medical supplies as an American pretext to destabilise his government, and told the crowd he had broken off diplomatic relations with Colombia because the country was being used for “attacks against Venezuela”.After his speech, as tear gas billowed at the country’s borders, he danced with his wife onstage in a bizarre display of nonchalance.Guaidó, who had declared himself interim president in late January, had claimed a premature victory at about noon local time, announcing that the first aid had already crossed the border from Brazil.But they went only a few metres inside Venezuela, and by evening the two small trucks loaded with donations had driven back into Brazil, citing security concerns..By the end of Saturday, which the opposition had made a deadline for aid shipments to cross the border, it appeared the two sides had settled into an uneasy standoff.Colombia announced late on Saturday that it would close all the border crossings for two days, to check for damage after attempts to take aid across were met with fierce violence. At one point tear gas fired by Venezuelan forces set an aid truck alight.The most serious clashes were on the Santander bridge separating Cúcuta and the Venezuelan town of Ureña. There volunteers escorted aid trucks up to a security cordon but were pushed back by rubber bullets and tear gas, and gangs loyal to Maduro threw stones at opposition supporters from atop a truck.“I was crossing the bridge when a rubber bullet hit me,” said Carlos Juancho, a student from Merida, wounded in the neck. “This is how Maduro treats his people.”The opposition perhaps thought civilian convoys would test how far ordinary soldiers were willing to go to protect the government. Whatever their orders, many were expected to be uneasy about opening fire on unarmed fellow Venezuelans.There were at least 60 members of security forces in the area who crossed the border they were ordered to defend, Colombian immigration officials said. Guaidó took to Twitter to encourage others to join them.“In my position as commander in chief of the armed forces, I declare that soldiers who cross the border will not be considered traitors to their homeland,” Guaidó said in a tweet.But there were not enough defections to allow aid to pass the border crossings. Although Guaidó has won a wave of popular support and been recognised as Venezuela’s leader by the US and many of its allies, he has so far struggled to persuade the country’s military to back his cause en masse.Promotions and lucrative commercial opportunities have helped keep senior officers loyal, while many in the lower ranks are terrified of being punished for defection.One of the defectors who crossed on Saturday said it had taken courage to leave. “Brother, I have been thinking about this for days,” he said, in a video shared on social media. “It wasn’t something I decided overnight.”Many others in the security forces agreed with him but were too afraid to defect, he said. “You can’t say anything against the government.”Friday’s attack near the Brazil border suggested the military were under heavy pressure from senior officers. Local officials said the attack was the first time in living memory the armed forces had opened fire on indigenous people in the Gran Sabana area, a tourism hotspot famous for spectacular scenery.The violence began again early on Saturday on the other side of the country, police firing teargas at Venezuelans trying to cross into Colombia in Ureña. Most were not protesters but simply heading across for work or personal reasons.“We are frightened that what happened yesterday at the other border is going to happen here, with people killed and injured,” said Aurora Albarracin, 55.Later in the day, protests in towns on the Venezuelan side of the border also turned violent, with protestors throwing stones and bottles, burning military uniforms and setting a government bus on fire, and riot police responding with tear gas. Armed pro-government gangs also opened fire on civilians in the town of San Antonio, wounding at least eleven people.Rallies around the country aimed to persuade soldiers that they could switch sides. In Caracas, marchers headed for the Carlota military airport in the heart of the city.“I would tell the soldiers today: put reason and feeling ahead of your weapons,” said Daniel Bruce, an intensive care doctor who said his hospital didn’t have basic medical supplies. “You are also Venezuelans and you suffer the same as us when you go to the hospitals,” he said.“I’m marching because I believe in the rebirth of my homeland, and I believe that my patients have a right to humanitarian aid. Today is not about ideology, it is about human lives and dignity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22dc8101c893657c3c14d825f07a3db3fd963b55/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0339f570e30f98c38a8f2588880f1471","title":"china says preventive work in xinjiang detention camps should be applauded","story":"Government steps up outreach to foreign envoys, explaining its achievements in the region home to Muslim minoritiesChina’s counter-terrorism and de-radicalisation efforts in its far western region of Xinjiang should be applauded for creating a new method of tackling the problem, a senior diplomat told foreign envoys last week.China is stepping up its diplomatic outreach over controversial detention camps in the heavily Muslim region, inviting more foreign diplomats to visit as it seeks to head off criticism from Muslim-majority nations and at the United Nations.The government says the camps are re-education and training facilities, and have been highly successful in stopping attacks previously blamed on Islamist militants and separatists, but rights groups say they are internment camps.Chinese officials briefed diplomats from more than 80 countries and international organisations in Beijing on Friday about Xinjiang, the foreign ministry said on Sunday, confirming a Reuters report.The Xinjiang deputy governor, Erkin Tuniyaz, and deputy foreign minister, Zhang Hanhui, explained Xinjiang’s “development achievements” and their “preventive counter-terrorism and de-extremism work” to the gathering, the ministry said.“Xinjiang’s counter-terrorism and de-extremism efforts have created a new way to solve the symptoms and root cause of the difficult global issue of counter-terrorism, and are worthy of praise,” the statement paraphrased Zhang as saying.“China will continue to make its due contribution towards the global fight against terrorism.”The diplomats said China’s explanation had helped them understand Xinjiang, that what China was doing there was important for the rest of the world in combating terrorism, and that the “successful experience in Xinjiang was worth studying and drawing on,” the ministry added.It did not say which countries’ representatives had made the comments, or which countries’ envoys had attended.Diplomatic sources told Reuters last week that Western diplomats would attend, as well as those from countries close to China and which traditionally do not criticise its rights record.China is also lobbying hard to thwart scrutiny of the Xinjiang camps at the UN Human Rights Council’s main annual session, which opens on Monday.China has rejected all accusations of mistreatment in the camps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da2634ed88150dff5dc0e1a47d6b553339b1859/0_153_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dcc67b613f8db5fddde74601d70867d","title":"cuba evangelical crusade conservative christianity against gay marriage constitution referendum","story":"Conservative Christianity becomes a political force in referendum on state’s new constitutionA thousand parishioners gathered in the Methodist church in the Vedado district of Cuba’s capital on a recent Sunday morning. After the revival music and conga drums had faded, the dancers had come off stage and the faithful had lowered outstretched arms, Pastor Lester Fernández rounded off his sermon on the ruinous consequences that the legalisation of gay marriage would bring.“The Cuban church, as an essential part of society, is worried, and therefore has a right to a public voice,” he hollered into his microphone. “Amen,” replied the flock.On an island where mass campaigns against official policy are almost unprecedented – and where “scientific atheism” was once state doctrine – evangelical churches have burst on to the political scene in recent months to campaign against gay marriage.A new Cuban constitution will be put to a referendum on Sunday and, while the state apparatus is campaigning for a “yes” vote, the usually fractured Methodist, Baptist and Pentecostal churches are running a united counter-campaign, although it stops short of explicitly calling for a “no” vote. They fear the new constitution could open the door to gay marriage.“The Word is clear: God created mankind in his own image,” said Belkis Ros Pascual, 51, standing on Havana’s Malecón last Sunday as Bishop Ricardo Pereira and his wife, Maritza, gathered with more than 100 other Methodists to renew their wedding vows and express support for the traditional family. “God said: ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth’,” added Pascual, wearing a wedding dress and clasping a bunch of flowers. Pascual and her husband would vote no to the new constitution, she said.Last October, the Methodist, Baptist and Pentecostal churches organised a petition against the draft constitution which defined marriage as a union “between two people” rather than between a man and a woman. They delivered 178,000 signatures to the National Assembly, an unparalleled event in Cuba. The faithful daubed posters on doors, lamp-posts and buses across the island.The energetic campaign, chiming with deep-seated homophobia on the island, has overwhelmed the official LGBT rights campaign by the National Center for Sex Education (Cenesex), headed by Mariela Castro, daughter of the former president Raúl Castro, and a timid, mainly online campaign by independent Cuban gay rights activists. It has pressured the state to row back from enshrining marriage as a right for all, regardless of sexuality, in the new constitution. In December, the National Assembly replaced the “between two people” definition with more ambiguous language, saying it would legislate on the issue in the future.“Looking at how they’ve managed to derail gay marriage from the constitution, it’s clear the evangelicals have become a major political force,” said Javier Corrales, political science professor at Amherst College.In Cuba, the Communist party has gradually removed barriers to religion since the 1980s. Half of islanders now identify as religious, and evangelical Christianity has emerged as one of the three main religious forces, along with Catholicism and the Afro-Cuban religion, Santería.“Pentecostals have been highly adept at integrating national rhythms into their services,” said Andrew Chesnut, religious studies professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. “Afro-Cuban rhythms, which are heavy on percussion, animate Pentecostal services. Likewise, dance which is an important part of Cuban culture, has been integrated into services.”Cuba’s drawn-out economic and social crisis after the Soviet Union fell created fertile ground for missionaries to tread. “Before the socialist bloc collapsed, many people had the revolution as their god, but afterwards they realised that God is greater than any government,” said Pereira, head of Cuba’s Methodist church.Deep pockets in times of hardship have also been key. Pereira said his church receives around $200,000 annually from churches in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and the US.And Latin American churches have channelled funds to Cuban evangelicals for decades, paying for the conversion of thousands of homes into makeshift churches, as well as for musical equipment and food.“Living through the special period, you did better if you were a Protestant,” said Hal Klepak, history professor at the Royal Military College of Canada. “In any village in Cuba, people who attended the evangelical churches would have a meal after the service – when times are bad, that matters.”The US Department of State – which has long seen religion as a political lever on the island – also gives generously. Echo Cuba, a Miami charity that “exists to equip and strengthen the Independent Evangelical Churches of Cuba”, has received more than $2m in US government grants over the past decade.While most Cuban evangelicals, even those campaigning against gay marriage, balk at the suggestion they are doing anything political, there are tight bonds with the Christian right in the US and Latin America.Cuban pastors regularly meet their counterparts from elsewhere in the Americas to discuss strategy.Analysts speculate that, given time, gay marriage could become a wedge issue for a wider, anti-statist, free market agenda. “The campaign for a ‘no’ vote is the first time this group has become visible politically,” said Ariel Dacal Díaz, a Marxist political analyst. “But this force is brewing – it could be mobilised for other projects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c4e8ac762a5b2e5996be7262e8535118f8566d0/0_28_1350_810/master/1350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0994f14aad0d331f12fe56d4498c8d6f","title":"saudi arabia appoints its first female ambassador to us","story":"Saudi Arabia has named a princess as its first female ambassador to the United States, a key appointment as the fallout over journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder tests relations between the allies.Princess Reema bint Bandar replaced Prince Khalid bin Salman, the younger brother of the powerful crown prince who was appointed vice defence minister in a flurry of late-night royal decrees announced on state media.Prince Khalid’s appointment further centralises power in one branch of the ruling family after the crown prince took control of most levers of power and policy in the world’s top oil exporter. The reshuffle comes as Saudi Arabia seeks to quell an international outcry over Khashoggi’s murder last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which strained relations with its key ally.After initially denying no knowledge of Khashoggi’s disappearance, the kingdom finally acknowledged Saudi agents killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation.Princess Reema faces hostile US lawmakers who have threatened to take tough action against Saudi Arabia over the brutal killing amid claims that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman – the de-facto ruler who also serves as the defence minister – was personally responsible.The Saudi government has denied he had anything to do with the murder of Khashoggi, a royal insider-turned-critic who was a columnist with the Washington Post.“The appointment of a new envoy signifies an attempt by Riyadh to try and reset relations with Washington and draw a line under the Khashoggi affair, however unlikely that may be in practice, at least with congress,” Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute in US, said.Princess Reema, the daughter of a former longtime ambassador to the US, has been a leading advocate of female empowerment in the kingdom, which has long faced criticism over its treatment of women.The princess previously worked at the kingdom’s General Sports Authority, where she led a campaign to increase women’s participation in sports.Prince Khalid, a son of the king, and who served as ambassador since 2017, had been expected to leave Washington for some time – particularly after the global outcry over Khashoggi tarnished the kingdom’s reputation.His new appointment as deputy defence minister comes as a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia remains bogged down in a four-year conflict in neighbouring Yemen.It comes around a year after the crown princeannounced a military reform plan and a dramatic overhaul of top defence commanders.“As the Yemen war drags on and the military reform program continues to move painstakingly slow, Prince Khalid is gaining a difficult portfolio but one that is critical to his father, brother and the kingdom,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based Rand Corporation, said.“Prince Mohammed has struggled to delegate authority within this file which has rendered some efforts – chiefly military reform – stagnant, and Prince Khalid’s appointment may be an attempt to reinvigorate these initiatives.”Khashoggi’s killing has refocused attention on the Saudi-led coalition’s bombing campaign in Yemen, which is gripped by what the UN calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.Earlier this month, the US House voted overwhelmingly to end American involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war effort in Yemen, dealing a rebuke to President Donald Trump who has publicly thrown his support behind the crown prince.US lawmakers this month also said they were probing whether Trump was rushing to sell sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia to please corporate supporters who stand to profit handsomely.The House of Representatives committee has voiced fears that Saudi Arabia could convert US expertise into making a nuclear bomb, heightening already severe tensions with regional rival Iran."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Youth stabbed on Liffey Street at around 2:50am on Sunday morning\u0026lsquoThis has been an

Boat Club. Photograph: Liam BurkePress 22A 12-year-old girl was in a critical condition in hospital on Saturday night after she was trapped under a capsized rowing boat in the river Shannon.Firefighters who discovered the boat, cut the girl’s hair to free her after it had become entangled in the boat’s outriggers, used to anchor the oars to the boat.Firefighters administered first aid to the girl and took her ashore in their boat before she was taken by ambulance to University Hospital Limerick.Three other girls all believed to be of a similar age, were in the boat at the time, and were understood to have been accompanied by a support boat.The incident unfolded around 10am at a stretch of the river known locally as the Old Salmon Weir. It is understood they had set off earlier along the Abbey River from a local boat club.The girl was expected to be transferred to Temple Street children’s hospital in Dublin for further treatment.Danny Ryan, who witnessed the incident, said he would be “forever haunted” by the\u0026nbspscreams for help from the girl’s friends.Mr Ryan said: “I could hear someone screaming. I could see the boat turned over and a girl waving and screaming. I could hear them calling the girl’s name, they kept calling for her.”“I couldn’t go to work. My stomach is sick over it. It was scary.”“I’m haunted all day. It’s the screams. I can still hear the girls screaming, ‘help, help help’.”One of the girls “kept calling me, ‘help me, help me, help me’, and she was waving her hands. I ran down by the weir. I kept slipping and I was nearly going into the water.”Mr Ryan praised the quick response of firefighters who were joined by Limerick Marine Search and Rescue Service, the Shannon-based Coast Guard Rescue Helicopter, and local gardaí.His wife Susan, who also saw the incident said: “I was roaring over to them that help was on the way”. She said one of the girls “screamed” at her to help.A Garda investigation is under way.

FIle photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The The Social Democrats party is in crisis after its party chairman and vice-chair resigned in protest over the controversy surrounding local election candidate Ellie Kisyombe.The executive board members Joe O’Connor and Carly Bailey resigned after the party decided to conduct a “review” of Ms Kisyombe’s story.It is understood that the national executive vote on the review was 9-2 in favour of carrying it out.A report in last week’s Sunday Times alleged that Ms Kisyombe, who is seeking a place on Dublin City Council in the May election, had arrived in Ireland later than she had stated in media interviews.Ms Kisyombe is originally from Malawi and has spoken of her experience of living in the direct provision system for much of the last decade.A spokesman for the Social Democrats confirmed “with regret” that the resignations had taken place. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the party said: “The co-leaders wrote to the national executive and expressed concern at the allegation that there may be some inaccuracies in Ellie’s back story, while also appreciating the complexities and severe difficulties posed for those caught up in the asylum process. As a result, the national executive subsequently met and has decided to carry out a review to work through this with Ellie.”Kildare North TD Catherine Murphy and Dublin North West TD Róisín Shortall are the co-leaders of the party.Ms Kisyombe remained a candidate on Saturday evening, the party said.MisgivingsAn email from party chairman Mr O’Connor, seen by The , states that he has decided to “step aside as party chairperson with immediate effect”.It is understood that grave misgivings had emerged at party leadership level over Ms Kisyombe’s story, and the fact that she had been advised by her lawyers not to answer questions about her immigration history.A clear conflict has emerged between members of the executive board over the path to be taken, emails seen by The  show.“This is not something which I take lightly, and it is a situation that I have been desperately hoping could be avoided over the past week,” Mr O’Connor wrote.“However, I cannot stand over the decision made by the national executive last night, or how the party intends to proceed from here.“I believe we have been forced to view this issue through a narrow lens, and as a result seem intent on pursuing a course of action which I believe is wholly inconsistent with the interpretation of a majority of our members and supporters, and will as a result inflict irreparable damage to the party in my view.”Mr O’Connor wrote that alternatives to the course of action chosen by the Social Democrats were and are available, “if our response to this issue had not been framed with a pre-determined outcome from the start”.He wrote that his “direct experience with how we approached the issue is one which I cannot accept”.“Over the past couple of weeks, I also believe irreconcilable gaps have emerged between party officers and leaders on how the party exercise good governance and due process for elections,” he wrote.He concludes by stating that “it may be too late but I would urge the party leadership to consider changing course, for the sake of our candidates and the party’s continued survival”.Fundamentally disagreesMs Bailey, who is vice-chair of the party and a general election candidate for the party in Dublin South-West has also resigned her position on the executive board. In her resignation letter, she makes clear that she fundamentally disagrees with a decision taken by the party leadership to issue a statement regarding the issue to the Sunday Times in tomorrow’s edition.She says that he “cannot stand over a decision which includes a statement that will go to the media, which in effect could and will be construed as the party essentially abandoning a candidate and especially one so vulnerable as a person living in direct provision”.“I have tried to work with everyone to find a resolution to this. I am as aware as anyone how critical this has been to us as a party. I am very disappointed that both Róisin and Catherine are of the opinion that the national executive has failed in its duties to do so this week, given the number of hours many of us have put in to try and find a way through this.“I joined this party in the belief that the Social Democrats were different. I cannot describe how devastated and disappointed I am that we have ended up here.”She writes that she “cannot stand over effectively what feels like appeasing the opinions of political correspondents over that of many of the members of the national executive, our candidates, our members and our supporters”.“It is also clear to me that the leaders remain convinced that Ellie is unviable as a candidate. Upon reflection this morning, I cannot see how this matter can be reconciled with such polarising views.”She concludes with the hope that “the party remains intact”.Major isionThe issue has caused major ision within the party, with the Dublin Central branch on Saturday evening contacting members to affirm its support for Ms Kisyombe.An email sent to party members said: “The Dublin Central branch of the Social Democrats have today reiterated their full support for their selected candidate for the North Inner City Ward in the 2019 Local Elections, Ellie Kisyombe.”“For legal reasons Ellie was, and remains unable to speak about her application, or any issues that have been raised in the Sunday edition of a national newspaper.“This places Ellie in an extremely complex situation, but she looks forward to being able to clear her name once leave to remain has been granted.“We also extend our sincerest thanks to our colleagues Joe O’Connor, Carly Bailey and the members of our party’s National Executive who’ve demonstrated immense leadership in preserving the values upon which our party was founded.“Dublin Central Social Democrats remain dedicated to supporting our friend Ellie Kisyombe’s candidacy, alongside Carol Deans, for local election and would be both honoured and proud to have such fine candidates represent the North Inner City, as new and erse voices for transformative politics.”Mr O’Connor said that he did not wish to make any comment at present. Efforts to contact Ms Bailey were unsuccessful."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803496.1550937270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pope francis describes feminism as machismo with a skirt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPope Francis attending the third day of a summit at the Vatican on sex abuse in the Catholic Church. Photograph: AFPVatican media Pope Francis has described feminism as “machismo with a skirt” during a brief intervention at the four-day meeting on the protection of minors in the church which is taking place at the Vatican.Meanwhile, one of the church’s leading cardinals has admitted that files on clerical child abuse have been destroyed by bishops.Pope Francis made his comment about feminism in an off-the-cuff remark after hearing an address from a woman at the meeting.“Inviting a woman to speak is not to enter into the mode of an ecclesiastical feminism, because in the end every feminism ends up being a machismo with a skirt. No. Inviting a woman to speak about the wounds of the church is to invite the church to speak about herself, about the wounds she has,” he said.He was speaking following an address by Dr Linda Ghisoni, undersecretary for the Laity at the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Laity, Family, and Life and one of three women among 12 speakers scheduled to give addresses to the 190 Catholic church leaders in attendance at the meeting.The church leaders include 10 other women. Ireland is being represented at the meeting by the president of the Irish Episcopal Conference, Archbishop Eamon Martin.In her address, Dr Ghisoni recalled how “a priest, a few days ago, exclaimed ‘Still? We continue talking about abuse! The church’s attention to this theme is exaggerated’.”She continued how “even a practicing lady told me candidly: ‘It is better not to talk about these matters, otherwise there will be distrust of the church. Talking about it obscures all the good done in the parishes’.”Referring to priests who sexually abuse children as “howling wolves that penetrate the fold to scare further and disperse the flock” she said that “becoming aware of the phenomenon and (to) understand one’s responsibility is not a fixation”.Destroyed filesIn his address to the meeting on Saturday, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, President of the German Bishops’ Conference and a member of the Council of Cardinals which advises Pope Francis, said clerical child sex abuse files have been destroyed in some dioceses.“Files that could have documented the terrible deeds and named those responsible were destroyed, or not even created. Instead of the perpetrators, the victims were regulated and silence imposed on them.”He said the “rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot, and left to the whims of iniduals”.“These are all events that sharply contradict what the church should stand for,” he said.At a press conference in the Vatican this afternoon he was talking about the German Catholic Church and that this destruction of documents had been established in a 2014 study conducted there. He said he assumed “Germany is not an isolated case”.In his address to the meeting, he said “establishing transparent procedural norms and rules for ecclesiastical processes is essential. Institutional mistrust leads to conspiracy theories regarding an organisation, and the formation of myths about an organisation. This can be avoided if the facts are set out transparently.”‘Mediocrity and hypocrisy’In another address on Saturday, Sr Veronica Openibo, a Nigerian who has worked in Africa, Europe and the United States, berated the bishops for mistakes in handling the sexual abuse crisis, saying the church had to acknowledge its “mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency”.“We proclaim the Ten Commandments and parade ourselves as being the custodians of moral standards and values and good behaviour in society. Hypocrites at times? Yes! Why did we keep silent for so long?” she said.She told Pope Francis, sitting near her on the dais, that she admired him because he was “humble enough to change your mind”, apologise and take action after he initially defended a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse. The bishop later resigned.“How could the clerical church have kept silent, covering these atrocities? The silence, the carrying of the secrets in the hearts of the perpetrators, the length of the abuses and the constant transfers of perpetrators are unimaginable,” she said.‘Crisis and shame’She spoke of her shock when she watched the 2015 Oscar-winning film Spotlight, which uncovered how church leaders in Boston moved predator priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking them or turning them over to civil authorities.“At the present time, we are in a state of crisis and shame. We have seriously clouded the grace of the Christ-mission,” Sr Openibo said.“We must acknowledge that our mediocrity, hypocrisy and complacency have brought us to this disgraceful and scandalous place we find ourselves as a church. We pause to pray, Lord have mercy on us!” she said.She said church leaders must shed their habit of hiding events for fear of making a mistake.“Too often we want to keep silent until the storm has passed. This storm will not pass by. Our credibility is at stake,” she said.Leading cardinals told the four-day conference on Friday that the church must repair the “systematic failures” that enabled sexual abuse to take root around the world, and bishops should start policing each other’s behaviour.At the start of the conference on Thursday, five victims told painful stories of abuse and cover-up and the pope said they could expect concrete measures to come out of the meeting.Victims groups have complained that while some priests who sexually abused children were eventually disciplined by the church and sentenced by civil authorities, the bishops who either enabled the abuse or covered it up have not been punished.The conference ends on Sunday when the pope will make a final speech. The Vatican says it will then formulate follow-up measures to make sure all bishop return home knowing how to put anti-abuse procedures into place. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

To many, Hyndman says, this is seen as simply “trying too hard.”  And Anders Godal, design director and partner at The Creators Club, said: People’s perception of luxury has changed drastically over the last few years. It seems the trend nowadays is leaning more towards the understated and simple, whereas in the past things were designed to stand out as luxurious – so the trend towards more simplified typography is a natural progression.For example, when we work with clients who would like more of a high-end or luxurious feel to their brand it’s more down to the details, like choice of materials and finishes and not so much leaning on a fancy font.  Retail and Consumer industryComment: Will ‘woke’ David Lammy tackle his unconscious bias against the suburbs?Pope vows to fight sex abuse in the Church with \u0026#39the wrath of God\u0026#39Duchess of Sussex has henna tattoo as she and Harry visit schoolchildren in MoroccoComment: Our laws don’t address the fundamental wrong done to our country when people pursue jihad – betrayalComment: I helped found the ERG – accusations of extremism are ridiculousShamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39Pianist determined to keep alive music of war hero killed at Battle of the Somme Pete Buttigieg sets out his case for 2020: \u0026#39We have to find a message which goes beyond Trump\u0026#39Comment: When did we become a nation of catastrophe addicts?Green snow falling in Russia shakes Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s popularityNew head of Natural England \u0026#39wrong man for job\u0026#39 say countryside campaignersPolice called in after medics attacked by anti abortion campaignersRoyals face pressure to call off Cuba visit over concerns regime is helping prop up Nicolás MaduroComment: TIGgers may have the establishment on their side, but the masses will decide their fateComment: Was the Venezuela aid shambles part of a masterplan - or a chaotic cascade into war?HMRC is \u0026#39ruthlessly\u0026#39 pursuing its own staff for potential six-figure bills in unpaid tax\u0026#39I’m just trying to survive here\u0026#39: Shamima Begum prepares for life in a chaotic Syrian refugee campChurch of England should make land available for gypsies and travellers, General Synod votesGardening can do what medicine only \u0026#39tries to mimic\u0026#39 for mental health, Monty Don saysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/23/TELEMMGLPICT000189280450_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"shamima begam says uk government making example abandoned fate","story":"Begum said no British officials had contacted her in the camp to notify her of the stripping of her citizenshipIsil bride Shamima Begum has accused the British government of “making an example of her by stripping her of UK citizenship, but admits she now regrets speaking out about her situation.Speaking to The  in the al-Hol camp in Syria, the 19-year-old from east London said she might have been able to keep her UK passport if her case had not attracted so much attention.They are making an example of me, she said.

It meant no church services on a Friday of a bank holiday weekend. The church was inaccessible. People wanting to visit their relatives and families buried in the churchyard couldn’t. There was a lot of upset and fear. FAQ | What is the General Synod?“Eventually they did leave and we had quite a job to do. It didn’t matter cleaning up the black bags but there was the issue of excrement. My husband and I put on our gloves because the smell was quite interesting. “They then moved around the area to our second church, the local school and private land. There was broken glass and with it being a hot summer, it set fire to the field. There was a lot of bad feeling.”Despite her concerns, the motion was passed by 265 votes to one. Its recommendations include that the Church should establish a Commission on Sites for Gypsies and Travellers and for Bishops in the House of Lords to “speak out boldly” against legislation that seeks to marginalise the community.The Bishop of Chelmsford, Stephen Cottrell, told the Synod that comments against travellers he has recently heard are “too distressing and poisonous to repeat”. He said: “We have an unsustainable and unjust situation where people are being are being evicted from unauthorised land without any authorised alternative being available. “It is our responsibility to put this right and the Church can play its part to help find new sites. This motion is a small way of making a change.”Prior to the vote, the motion was amended because it suggested that offering up the lands could help “prevent crime and disorder”. The Bishop of Chelmsford said the term “plays into the hands of all the worse stereotypes which fuel misunderstanding and prejudice” and successfully requested that it was removed. There are 500,000 travellers in the UK, of which less than 10 per cent are actually travelling. Dr Elizabeth Henry, a national adviser to the committee for minority ethnic anglican concerns, said: “We want to look at how the Church could actually work at making land available, or at least lobbying in terms of making land available. “There is not a specific project in mind. There may well be in the next year or so further work around housing that we wanted to make sure this area of work will be very much a part of that work.”Church of EnglandComment: Will ‘woke’ David Lammy tackle his unconscious bias against the suburbs?Pope vows to fight sex abuse in the Church with \u0026#39the wrath of God\u0026#39Duchess of Sussex has henna tattoo as she and Harry visit schoolchildren in MoroccoComment: Our laws don’t address the fundamental wrong done to our country when people pursue jihad – betrayalComment: I helped found the ERG – accusations of extremism are ridiculousShamima Begum says UK government is \u0026#39making an example of me\u0026#39Pianist determined to keep alive music of war hero killed at Battle of the Somme Pete Buttigieg sets out his case for 2020: \u0026#39We have to find a message which goes beyond Trump\u0026#39Comment: When did we become a nation of catastrophe addicts?Green snow falling in Russia shakes Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s popularityNew head of Natural England \u0026#39wrong man for job\u0026#39 say countryside campaignersRoyals face pressure to call off Cuba visit over concerns regime is helping prop up Nicolás MaduroPolice called in after medics attacked by anti abortion campaigners\u0026#39I’m just trying to survive here\u0026#39: Shamima Begum prepares for life in a chaotic Syrian refugee campGardening can do what medicine only \u0026#39tries to mimic\u0026#39 for mental health, Monty Don saysComment: TIGgers may have the establishment on their side, but the masses will decide their fateHMRC is \u0026#39ruthlessly\u0026#39 pursuing its own staff for potential six-figure bills in unpaid taxElections watchdog accused of \u0026#39whitewashing\u0026#39 complaints that its board members breached impartiality rulesComment: Was the Venezuela aid shambles part of a masterplan - or a chaotic cascade into war?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/23/TELEMMGLPICT000189280489_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"just trying survive shamima begum prepares life chaotic syrian","story":"Children walk through al-Hol detention camp for foreign female Isil members and their children, in northern SyriaA hundred miles from the tarpaulin tent which Shamima Begum now calls home, the caliphate she once crossed the world to join was in its death throes. A dwindling band of Islamic State fighters were surrounded by advancing Kurdish forces and facing annihilation beneath waves of American and British airstrikes. But the 19-year-old from east London was indifferent to the end of the jihadist territory.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude.

Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHShe added: “In fact that’s why I\u0026nbspsat down with him in the first place. I\u0026nbspsaw an opportunity to pick someone so opposite’s brain and try to talk some sense into them which i understand is highly unlikely but I\u0026nbspwill not apologise for trying. That’s all.”Grande said in a follow-up message she was “anything but complacent” during her conversation with Morgan, adding: “I\u0026nbspwon’t stop having conversations with people I\u0026nbspdisagree with when I\u0026nbspsee the opportunity to.”Morgan shared a photo of himself with Grande earlier this week on Twitter, saying they had spoken for about two hours.“We laughed, we argued, she cried, I nearly did, the drinks flowed and\u0026nbspwe bonded,” he wrote. “Turns out we really like each other. Weird.”The message left some Twitter users baffled, including one person who wrote: “Ew Ariana why.”Someone else tweeted: “ARIANA NO,” while another person wrote: “Don’t like this.”In addition to their spat over Little Mix, Morgan criticised Grande after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing for not immediately visiting the victims of the attack. He apologised after Grande held the One Love Manchester concert, saying he had misjudged her.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But might history actually be on the side of the new movement, asks Adam LusherClick to followThe IndependentMarkus Keaney, local Labour chair, says Shuker would be annihilated in a by-electionIt’s not every day you get to rock a flat cap and give a Trotsky turn of phrase to the BBC News from Luton.\u0026nbspBut Markus Keaney, chair of Luton South Constituency Labour Party, managed it all this week, when\u0026nbsphe discussed his recently departed ex-comrade Gavin Shuker, the constituency’s MP.Keaney looked forward to the day when the defector to the Independent Group would be “consigned to the dustbin of history” and\u0026nbsp“annihilated” by an official Labour candidate at a by-election.\u0026nbspHis words were uttered\u0026nbspwith the cold rage of a man who knows his local party committee procedure and is prepared to use it in the cause of “passionate new members enthused by the promise of a break from neoliberalism” – as he described the post-Jeremy Corbyn intake in his September\u0026nbspMorning Star article, written after a\u0026nbspno-confidence vote taken by party members against\u0026nbspShuker was carried.But, to refer to the context in which Trotsky popularised the “dustbin of history” line, who here were the doomed Mensheviks, and who the 1917 Bolsheviks arising to greet the new post-Capitalist dawn?\u0026nbspAs the Independent Group went cross-party with the arrival of three defecting Conservatives, were we witnessing the start of something like Emmanuel Macron’s French En Marche!\u0026nbspmovement? Or would Keaney still get his annihilation moment?\u0026nbspShuker and the Labour splitCould it be the Corbyn project that is doomed?\u0026nbspPerhaps lessons could be learned in Luton, a town with some claim to being a bit of a bellwether.\u0026nbspUntil\u0026nbspShuker upset the trend by getting elected for Labour in 2010, the Luton South constituency had gone to the party that won the general election in every contest since 1951.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

You never change things from the outside. He should stand his ground and try to f***ing sort it from inside.”There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it? But I am a born optimistAnd yet. The more you spoke to Gallagher, and his workmates, and others, the more you sensed a certain sympathy for Shuker and the points he was making about “abuse” in the party, about failure to oppose hard Brexit, and about Jeremy Corbyn.Painter and decorator John Brydson, 68, initially described himself as a Tory-voting Brexit supporter. But it turned out the backstory was more tangled, in ways that might favour Shuker, not Corbyn. “I was Labour for 50 years,” said Brydson.\u0026nbsp“But when Corbyn came in, I changed to Tory.\u0026nbspThere will never be a Labour government while he is at the head of the Labour Party.”Shuker was one of seven Labour members to quit the party on Monday\u0026nbsp(PA)He too didn’t like the way Shuker had left the party. “But yeah, I would vote for him, even though the way he went about it was wrong.”There was a moment of reflection when you mentioned\u0026nbspKeaney’s prediction that a by-election would see Shuker “annihilated” by an official Labour candidate.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think so,” said Mr Brydson softly.MPs: Joan Ryan,\u0026nbspHeidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston (Reuters)Gallagher, meanwhile, seemed to be moving a long way in a short discussion, from “absolute rubbish” to “fair play to him”.\u0026nbspHe was an unwavering Labour man, he insisted: “All my life, working-class, always vote Labour.”But when you put him on the spot, and ask\u0026nbsphim to pick sides in a by-election fight between Shuker and a Keaney-approved Corbyn Labour candidate, there was a long pause.\u0026nbsp“Christ, you would have to go with Shuker, wouldn’t you?\u0026nbspYou would have to go sensible. The bloke with the cap, a proper lefty, wasn’t he?\u0026nbspToo much hatred in his voice, I thought.”The more ardent anti-neoliberal Corbynistas may not wish to be reminded of the old aphorism that the Labour Party owes more to Methodism than Marxism.\u0026nbspBut it was impossible to ignore as you sat in the Hardware Cafe\u0026nbspand pondered the new battle for the soul of British politics.\u0026nbspThe view from the cafe windows was dominated by the Mount Tabor Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1897, grandeur unfaded, the names of the Victorian worthies who supported the project carved in stone for all to see.\u0026nbspMethodism still seemed to be triumphing over Marxism in 2019.\u0026nbspAl Short, 51, social worker and Christian, arrived.\u0026nbspHe still believed in the ideals of 2015, when Corbyn was promising a “kinder, gentler politics”. He regarded the Labour leader as “a pretty principled, genuine kind of guy, who cares for the poor, offers a genuine alternative.”And yet in a very gentle, very Christian kind of way, and despite his vote for Brexit, Short seemed to be warming to Shuker and this new Independent Group.\u0026nbsp“I am a Christian.\u0026nbspGavin Shuker is a Christian. I have a sense of rapport with him.”He even went as far as hoping the gang of 11\u0026nbsp(and counting) could prove a more successful update of the Gang of Four, who for a brief 1980s flurry had\u0026nbsplooked as if they might reshape British politics by leaving Labour and forming the SDP.Shuker (right) with his colleagues announcing their breakaway\u0026nbsp(PA)Short smiled, as if imagining a mildly exciting future: “There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it?\u0026nbspBut I am a born optimist.”Shuker will face an altogether feistier proposition in Short’s support-worker colleague Lorna Calliste, 42, east London-born daughter of a Trinidadian mother, now a mum to four kids by an Irish builder, and a committed Brexit supporter.\u0026nbsp“No, no, no,” was the unequivocal response to Shuker’s talk of taking a stand against “hard Tory Brexit”.But if Calliste wasn’t exactly brimming with excitement for Shuker and the Independent Group, she didn’t seem a natural fit with\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Labour either.\u0026nbsp“Labour has\u0026nbspgone silly.\u0026nbspThey want to let everyone in the country.\u0026nbspWhy can’t we have an Australian system where we let someone in if they have something to offer?”In the Hardware Cafe, you began to sense that going against his constituency’s Brexit vote would not fatally undermine Shuker, and that, however fuzzily, other elements of what the Independent Group was saying had hit home.Luciana Berger’s message was remembered, even if her name wasn’t (PA)Luciana Berger may exist in the Luton South consciousness as “the lady with the dark hair”, but many agreed with her that “what’s happening with the antisemitism is disgusting”.\u0026nbspAnd the notion that politics is “broken” sold itself.Stephen McNeilly had been excited by politics, once.\u0026nbspNow the 39-year-old electrician placed himself firmly in the camp of “the name Gavin Shuker rings a bell”.\u0026nbspHis disillusion with politics was a badge of pride, enlivened by references to Corbyn as “an absolute plank” to Brexit as a “f***ing shambles” to former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, whose life fell apart when she was caught “fiddling her expenses”.My son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a tryAnd yet, in almost the same lament, McNeilly seemed to be crying out for someone to inspire him and all the others languishing in the ranks of the disillusioned.\u0026nbsp“There’s no Martin Luther King figure,” he said.\u0026nbsp“No one with fresh ideas, no one with a voice, to make people stand up and listen.”Vividly expressed disillusion began to sound a little like an open invitation to Shuker and his Independent Group – all the more so when McNeilly turned to his own, conflicted feelings about having voted Leave.MPs have left the Labour party to form independent group“Every single thing I voted for – stopping immigration first and foremost – will be made null and void.\u0026nbspWe’re going to be financially crippled, kicked in the teeth. The dreadful thing is,\u0026nbspI would want to reverse it and vote Remain.”Perhaps all the conversations seemed to be running Shuker’s way.Why the Independent Group won’t succeed without electoral reformCabinet ministers back new Independent Group, claim Tory defectorsEx-Tory MP says battle for party is over as Brexit hardliners have wonBut then, Edward, a rather thoughtful 68-year-old, looked up from his book, and wondered whether we might be seeing things through a bit of a mainstream media haze.\u0026nbsp“My son’s 29,” said Edward, “And, I think, rather fooled by Corbyn.\u0026nbspSomehow Corbyn has got into young people, by young person’s media.\u0026nbspI suppose I am a centrist dad.\u0026nbspI’m so old I remember the Labour government of the 1970s that led us into trouble, into strikes.“But my son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a try.”But do they really, still?\u0026nbspThe University of Bedfordshire’s campus offered the chance of a probably wildly unscientific straw poll of the much-discussed millennial generation.\u0026nbspIt left you wondering whether the fever of Corbyn-mania may have cooled somewhat since the heady days of the June 2017 general election.Kieran Nixon, 23, was president of the student union, but when he spoke in a personal capacity he began to sound like a lot of others on campus.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2015 because his parents did.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2017 because of genuine enthusiasm for Corbyn.\u0026nbsp“He kind of set up this persona,” said Nixon, “that he was new, fresh, ‘down with the kids’, articulate.\u0026nbspI saw him going to festivals, saying he would clear the student loan debt.“But now it just feels like it was a pipe dream.\u0026nbspI don’t think I can see him being prime minister.\u0026nbspHe seems short of ideas, too quick to pass the blame to Theresa May.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t come up with any worthwhile solution to Brexit that could get accepted by Brussels.”“Maybe,” said Nixon, recalling that summer when he was 20 months younger and Corbyn was at Glastonbury, “going to festivals doesn’t really say professionalism.”Daisie Johnson: ‘The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Corbyn opposing Brexit’ (Adam Lusher)Daisie Johnson also liked the Glastonbury appearance, at the time.\u0026nbsp“Corbyn tries to talk to young people,” said the psychology and criminal behaviour student. “Which is more than you can say for Theresa May.”But now, the full impact of the EU referendum – in which she was too young to participate – has hit home:\u0026nbsp“The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Jeremy Corbyn opposing Brexit.\u0026nbspThat doesn’t seem to come up on the news feed.\u0026nbspI’m probably more for this other guy if he is against Brexit and Corbyn isn’t.”So no,\u0026nbspJohnson didn’t know who “this other guy” Shuker was.\u0026nbspAnd she didn’t really see how the Independent Group could turn a bit of House of Commons seating rearrangement into real change.\u0026nbsp“Where’s the majority to do anything? I don’t really get it.”Soubry and Sarah Wollaston join their new honourable friends\u0026nbspin the House of Commons (PA)But nor did McNeilly really get it when we began talking, and now he was at least a little interested.\u0026nbsp“I’ll try to catch a glimpse of what he’s saying,” said the 39-year-old.\u0026nbsp“More power to the guy: a journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.”So what if that first step will be Shuker telling us who he is? They sneered at Macron to begin with, and he made it into the Elysee, avoiding the dustbin of history.\u0026nbspKeaney might be annoyed, but perhaps Shuker can take comfort in the fact there was even a time when no one knew who Trotsky and the Bolsheviks were either.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials?

The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.App wont pair with left shoe, the top review reads.\u0026nbspPaired with sneakers right after unboxing then completely crashed after last update.Why Nike thinks the future of its stores is an appAnother reviewer wrtes: whenever I try connecting my shoes, it says error try again or it says it\u0027s already connected with another pair of shoes.Most complain that the app has broken on the left shoe specifically, while the right shoe continues to work.The iOS version of the app is still working, suggesting the problem is with the design of the Android tools.The problems appear to have arrived after Nike sent out a firmware update intended to fix problems with the shoes.

Jennifer Lopez, Awkwafina, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Brie Larson, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Amandla Stenberg, Charlize Theron, Tessa Thompson\u0026nbspand Constance Wu will be handing out the statuettes.The show is also expected to focus on\u0026nbspwhat has been a strong year for music in film, with Best Actress hopeful\u0026nbspLady Gaga down to perform “Shallow” from the third remake of\u0026nbspA Star is\u0026nbspBorn\u0026nbspwith director and co-star Bradley Cooper.Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\u0026nbspwill perform “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings” from the Coen Brothers’s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u0026nbspand Jennifer Hudson will sing “I’ll Fight” from the documentary RBG.\u0026nbspProducer Donna Gigliotti\u0026nbspand director Glenn Weiss have meanwhile been tasked with bringing off a leaner show this time around, running under three hours for the first time since 1973.To achieve this, some of the lower-profile awards will be handed out while the broadcast is in commercial breaks, saving almost an hour after 2018’s telecast staggered on for a gruelling\u0026nbspthree hours and 53 minutes.Which films have been nominated\u0026nbspfor the top prizes?Yorgos Lanthimos’s period drama The Favourite and Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma secured 10 nominations each.Both films are have been shortlisted\u0026nbspfor the prestigious Best Picture award, along with Black Panther (a popular choice), BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, Green Book, A Star is Born\u0026nbspand Vice.The Oscar nominations prove change is coming – but not fast enoughThe Favourite‘s Olivia Colman is in pole position to land Best Actress for her superb performance as Queen Anne while co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will continue their ficitonal rivalry in the Best Supporting Actress category.Christian Bale is hotly-tipped to win Best Actor for his role as former vice-president Dick Cheney in Adam McKay’s satire while the Best Supporting Actor category drew contrasting responses from a delighted Richard E Grant and a very droll Sam Elliott (“It’s about f***ing time”).The Academy has been criticised for again failing to list a female filmmaker in the Best Director category while fans of Timothee Chalamet were disappointed his performance as a drug addict in\u0026nbspFelix Van Groeningen’s Beautfiul Boy was overlooked.You can read a complete list of the nominations here\u0026nbspand an overview of the\u0026nbspbiggest talking points from the announcement here.What happened to the\u0026nbspBest Popular Film category?The new award was announced in August but withdrawn a month later on the strength of the hostile reception it received.Critics and fans argued the category would be used as a means of sidelining crowd-pleasing blockbusters like Black Panther, keeping Best Film free for the “prestige” pictures that usually dominate.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has said it “will examine and seek additional input regarding the new category” and has not ruled out its future revival.The Academy announced in June 2018 it had invited 928 new members of the filmmaking profession to join its ranks.Part of a new initiative commenced under former Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the measure is intended to address the shocking revelation in 2016 that 92 per cent of membership was white and 75 per cent male.Invitations were extended to actors including Amy Schumer, Kumail Nanjiani, Dave Chappelle, Sarah Silverman and\u0026nbspJada Pinkett Smith as well as a host technicians, directors and executives in a bid to improve ersity and offer a broader representation of opinion.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

In the current vogue for maximum screen size but minimum phone size, while noting that our hands aren\u0027t getting any bigger, a screen that can double in size was bound to come along sooner or later.And it looks like other companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, Motorola and even Apple are exploring the technology. It\u0027s made possible by flexible OLED displays. Another company, Royole, already has a phone that folds out to become a tablet.Samsung has had these flexible OLEDs for a while –\u0026nbspmost recent flagships from the company have featured them – but they\u0027re encased in solid glass, so you might not have noticed.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

It was only when a flexible cover layer was developed that folding phones could happen.The Fold has a 4.7in screen when it\u0027s closed, looking like a regular smartphone, if a bit thicker. Then, it opens up to reveal a second screen inside, which measure 7.3-inches. To put that in context, many smaller tablets on the market boast 7-inch displays.So, how convenient, no need to carry two gadgets any more but still have the joys of the big screen. But, from seeing the new device, I have some initial reservations.First, the bigger display has a weird screen ratio. It\u0027s not quite square but at 4.2:3 is noticeably squarer than many tablets. Samsung displayed a Netflix movie on it, which looked great except that quite a lot of the screen was black bars on either side, which reduced the effect. I suspect it would have looked better on the smaller front display, where it would fill it entirely.This shape means you can display three apps at once, like a YouTube feed, Instagram and a web page. The YouTube element, even in the biggest window, only had a tiny video element, which also wasn\u0027t that appealing.These are early days, though, and there may well be a combination of apps which will work well together.Second, the display didn\u0027t look sensational. Although it opens perfectly flat and images can run across the two with no sense of a join, as the Fold tilted in the light, a straight line that looked like a crease was visible. Perhaps this was because it was an early sample and when the phone is released (26 April in the US, 3 May in Europe) this will have been sorted.Third, can it really justify the cost? In the US, the price starts at $1,980 and in Europe, $2,000. No UK price was given though expect it to be around £1,600 or more. For that money you could buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 and a 9.7in iPad and have a lot of cash left over.But you wouldn\u0027t have the convenience of the two-devices-in-one that the Galaxy Fold turns out to be.\u0026nbsp And in terms of innovation, a folding phone is the most exciting development in phone design for years.Samsung Galaxy S10: Best network deals in the UKThe other phones look rather more ordinary in comparison, but offer noticeable upgrades from the current Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ handsets.Both the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ feature a pretty exciting innovation, a fingerprint sensor buried in the display itself that\u0026nbspallows\u0026nbspthe screen to stretch across the whole of the front of the phone. Well, almost.There\u0027s a tiny punch-hole in the S10 screen, a bigger one on the S10+, where the front-facing camera (or cameras on the larger phone) sit.Samsung says that the technology it\u0027s used, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, is the most advanced around and in my brief use of it, it\u0027s very fast indeed and in a day or so\u0027s use recognised my thumbprint 100 per cent of the time –\u0026nbspa little better than rival in-screen sensors from Huawei and others.There is a downside to this tech: It won\u0027t work through thick screen protectors, so check before you buy a protector for your phone.Both cameras also adopt triple camera units on the rear with two 12-megapixel sensors offering wide and super-wide lenses. The wide lens has an automatically adjusting aperture to allow more light in when there\u0027s not much there. The third sensor, backed by a 16-megapixel sensor, is an ultra-wide lens with a field of view which Samsung says matches that of the human eye.The new phones also have two-way wireless charging so that you can place a friend\u0027s wireless-compatible phone against the S10 or S10+ and charge it from the Samsung. Testing it with an iPhone XS Max, it worked instantly and is a very satisfying feeling. Huawei had this feature first, but it\u0027s something every phone should have.The S10e offered some of the S10\u0027s features in a smaller form, so every hand size may find something that fits. But you\u0027ll need big mitts to encompass the final phone release of the evening, the S10 5G. The difference here is, can you guess, it works on 5G networks. It\u0027ll be released in May and has a 6.7in display, the biggest Galaxy S phone yet.The Fold on its own puts Samsung out there when it comes to innovation, but the new Galaxy S10 range –\u0026nbspyou know, the ones most of us will consider buying –\u0026nbspoffer enough choice and a big step forward from last year\u0027s S9 range. The addition of the super-cool inscreen fingerprint sensor on the S10 and S10+ along with the new triple cameras will be enough to tempt many.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within an hour of liftoff, Beresheet was already sending back data and had successfully deployed its landing legs, according to SpaceIL.\u0026nbsp“We’ll keep analysing the data, but bottom line is we entered the very exclusive group of countries that have launched a spacecraft to the moon,” said Yigal Harel, head of SpaceIL’s spacecraft programme.\u0026nbspElon Musk’s SpaceX to have launches reviewed by PentagonElon Musk reveals price of a ticket to Mars on board SpaceX flightsPrime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was watching the launch live from the Israeli control centre in Yehud, near Tel Aviv.\u0026nbsp“This is a big step for Israel, but a giant step for Israeli technology,” he said.The four-legged Beresheet, barely the size of a washing machine, will circle Earth in ever bigger loops until it’s captured by lunar gravity and goes into orbit around the moon. Touchdown would be 11 April\u0026nbspat the Sea of Serenity.\u0026nbspNasa’s Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s took about three days to get astronauts to the moon, but they used monstrous Saturn V rockets.The $100m (£78m)\u0026nbspBeresheet mission could not\u0026nbspafford its own rocket – even a little one – so the organisers opted for a ride share. That makes for a much longer trip the moon\u0026nbspis currently nearly 230,000 miles\u0026nbspaway.\u0026nbsp“This is Uber-style space exploration, so we’re riding shotgun on the rocket,” Mr Winetraub explained at a news conference on the eve of launch.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspAir Force also has a small research spacecraft aboard the rocket, for a one-year mission in orbit around Earth.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Soviet Union was the first to put a spacecraft on the moon, Luna 2, in 1959. Nasa\u0026nbspfollowed with the Ranger 4 spacecraft in 1962. Last month, China became the first country to land on the far side of the moon.\u0026nbspApollo 11 astronaut\u0026nbspBuzz Aldrin quickly offered congratulations following Thursday’s launch. So did Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine, who called it “a historic step for all nations and commercial space as we look to extend our collaborations beyond low-Earth orbit and on to the moon”.\u0026nbspNasa\u0026nbsphas a laser reflector aboard Beresheet and is offering its Deep Space Network for communication.\u0026nbsp“All the best to @TeamSpaceIL as it starts its journey tonight on a @SpaceX #Falcon9 from Florida to my old stomping ground ... the moon,” Aldrin tweeted.\u0026nbspThe Beresheet mission originally was part of the Google Lunar XPrize competition and even made the final cut before the contest ended last year without a winner. The organisers decided to press ahead on their own, with donations from billionaires as well as schoolchildren.\u0026nbspLunar surface operations are meant to last just two days. Beresheet will measure the magnetic field at the landing site, and send back data and pictures. A time capsule is aboard the lander — which includes a picture of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003 — as well as a lunar library containing 30 million pages on a disk from the US-based Arch Mission Foundation.\u0026nbspRamon’s widow, Rona, was a big supporter of Beresheet she died of cancer in December.\u0026nbspFollowing liftoff, SpaceX recovered the first-stage booster, which flew twice last year. The booster landed smoothly on an offshore ocean platform, after the hottest re-entry yet, according to SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk. Sparks from burning metal were visible in the landing video.\u0026nbspMr Musk said the booster will fly a fourth time in April, during a launch abort test of the new crew Dragon capsule.

Anyone else sick and tired of having to press the three dots at the top just to hit repeat? Just to see your queue?Yeah, me too. The old mobile app was perfectly fine.In the replies, many said they were not even aware of how to actually get to the missing buttons.Getting to the menu that includes shuffle is relatively simple, even if it is not at all obvious and still relatively time-consuming. To bring up the lost menu, click the three dots that are in the top right corner of the now playing page, which will bring up a whole host of other missing buttons, such as the button that will take you into your queue.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or at least that’s what we were told by Liam Fox in 2017.The confidence beaming from the international trade secretary as he set off on his world tour to convince governments to do business with “global Britain” was notably absent this week.With little to show for his efforts, Fox\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspforced into an embarrassing climbdown, finally conceding that many of those\u0026nbsptrade deals had no chance of being ratified by 29 March.\u0026nbspSo where are we now – and why has Liam Fox fallen so far short of his own bar?No deal will be done in time with valuable trading partners Turkey and Japan, nor with the tiny European principalities of Andorra and San Marino.\u0026nbspCan UK continue trading with countries covered by an EU trade deal?Fox has so far delivered just six of the 40 deals he promised. The biggest positive he can point to is an agreement with Switzerland, a country which took £20bn of UK exports in 2017.By comparison, the UK shipped £278bn of goods and services to the EU in 2017. A deal with the trading bloc, Fox told us, would be “the easiest in human history”.\u0026nbspThe only other agreements he has so far been able to finalise in close to three years of toil account for a tiny percentage of UK trade. Israel is the largest among these, buying £2.4bn of UK goods and services, with £1.6bn flowing the other way.Agreements sealed with the Palestinian territories\u0026nbspand the Faroe Islands will do little to keep post-Brexit Britain afloat. We also have a deal with the 21 countries which make up the Common Market for\u0026nbspEastern and Southern Africa, but only Egypt accounts for anything more than a negligible amount of UK trade.Among the remaining countries in the group are two, which, according to official figures, imported no UK goods last year: Eritrea and Comoros.There is of course a chance that agreements will be reached in the next 35 days but Fox’s announcement hardly inspires confidence.He attempted to reassure the public with news that formal agreements are close with Fiji and Papua New Guinea.\u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspsimply served\u0026nbspto highlight the lack of progress on agreements with far more important trading partners.True, we have some form of agreement with the US, Australia and New Zealand but these mostly cover product standards. They aren’t full trade deals.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“Particularly intensive discussions” are happening with the European Economic Area, South African Customs Unions, Canada and South Korea, the trade secretary says – which sounds distinctly like they won’t be signed in time.It all seems like tinkering around the edges when you compare the figures involved to the vast sums of trade we conduct\u0026nbspwith the other 27 EU member states.None of this is to say that our trade secretary has been incompetent or lazy. No one said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic was easy.\u0026nbspAnd negotiating trade deals is\u0026nbspeven more fiendishly complex – they frequently\u0026nbspamount to hundreds of clauses covering standards and tariffs on vast\u0026nbspnumbers of products.Deals often take\u0026nbspyears to finalise, even for skilled negotiators focused on one agreement, let alone 40.Whether through arrogance or ignorance, Liam Fox did not listen to trade experts who said dozens of EU deals could not be “rolled over” with ease.\u0026nbspHe assured everyone it could be done, but that was never truly the case.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Having to say bye to my dad when he’s in handcuffs just hurts my heart. It’s like immigration doesn’t want my family to succeed.”During a meeting at the Jamaican High Commission, the child –\u0026nbspsurrounded by her three sisters, the youngest just a toddler, and mother – delivered a moving testimony that shed light on the impact of immigration control on families.The meeting took place two weeks after\u0026nbspa charter flight taking 29 iniduals from the UK to Jamaica prompted outrage in the wake of the Windrush scandal. Commissioner Seth George Ramocan organised the gathering in the hope that it would\u0026nbsphelp\u0026nbspinform discussions about how they cooperate with the Home Office on future deportations.But there was little discussion about policy or intergovernmental cooperation. From the outset, the meeting was highly charged with emotion, with\u0026nbsprelatives giving\u0026nbspheart-rending accounts of having their loved ones “snatched” from them and sent against their will to a country that, often, they barely knew or remembered.The mother of one man who was on the charter flight – after coming to the UK aged 11 –\u0026nbspexplained how her son had arrived in Jamaica with no one to care for him, and made a passionate plea that “all of our children who came here when they were young should be here. This is degrading. Our children need to come back.”With so many relatives already driven to despair and desperation over the Home Office’s treatment of their loved ones, there was little the commissioner could say to temper them. It was clear that they had little faith in anything he said.This comes as no\u0026nbspsurprise when you consider that many of these people have suffered years of fear and hopelessness at the hands of the British government, despite never being subjected to immigration control themselves.We can debate the use of\u0026nbspcharter flights\u0026nbspand the wider\u0026nbsphostile environment as forms of immigration control,\u0026nbspbut whether\u0026nbspenough attention is paid to the indirect devastation this has on their loved ones is another question.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

The same can be said for an unusually high number of gazebos on College Green – the patch of grass outside the House of Lords from which journalists broadcast to the nation.This week an aerial view of the Palace of Westminster was beamed into living rooms across the country as another dramatic week in British politics unfolded.At 10am on Monday, seven MPs quit Jeremy Corbyn‘s Labour Party with a withering assessment of his leadership – the biggest schism in the party since the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the 1980s.May eyes potential route out of Brexit deadlock in BrusselsPost-Brexit Britain won’t have any trade links left at this rateEU’s Juncker says he is not optimistic about avoiding no-deal BrexitBarclays sets aside £150m to prepare for Brexit falloutThe following evening, an eighth MP left Labour’s ranks and on Wednesday – an hour before prime minister’s questions – Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen left the Conservative Party to join the opposition benches.Together, the 11 MPs have formed the Independent Group in the House of Commons and, though they have not yet formed a political party, the group has more MPs than the Democratic Unionist Party and the same number as the Liberal Democrats.It means Theresa May‘s effective majority in the chamber has been reduced to eight, making her reliance on the DUP to prop up the government ever more important.While this week has undoubtedly increased the instability at Westminster, the parliamentary arithmetic for Brexit hasn’t shifted a great deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Labour split: the reaction on Twitter Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The prime minister still faces the mammoth task of getting her deal through the Commons and, regardless of which side of the Commons the three ex-Tory MPs are sitting on, it is unlikely they will suddenly drop their opposition to Ms May’s deal.Support for a fresh referendum still does not appear to command a majority in the chamber, and the likelihood of the prime minister declaring her support for a customs union (one of Labour’s red lines) remains slim at best.But the current turmoil will inevitably have a considerable impact on the debate. The hardline Brexiteer Conservative MPs in the European Research Group – wary of the effect more defections from the party could have – may provide the prime minister with a temporary show of unity as she continues to negotiate with Brussels.And with just 36 days\u0026nbspuntil Brexit, wavering Labour MPs wanting to avoid a no-deal scenario may feel more inclined to back Ms May’s proposals.

But Britain’s exit from the EU is far from the only thing\u0026nbspon their minds. So how is Europe’s domestic politics affecting the Brexit process?Arguments over the status of Gibraltar play well in Spain, and Spanish governments of all stripes have tried to inject the issue into the Brexit process. So far this has been more of a nuisance than an existential threat, but Spain’s ability to veto any future trade deal could become a serious problem down the road. Spain disputes British sovereignty of the territory.Ireland is the EU country most directly affected by Brexit. In Ireland, to a much greater extent than the UK, a hard border on the island of Ireland is politically very unpopular. As a result, the Irish government has said it will not accept a border in any circumstances,\u0026nbspeven in a\u0026nbspno-deal scenario. This has caused problems of its own: Ireland’s position has made it harder for the EU to convince sceptical Brexiteers that the backstop is necessary.Emmanuel Macron isn’t going to Sharm el-Sheikh, but he has arguably been one of the most influential figures shaping the overall EU response to Brexit. A committed centrist, Mr Macron sees it as his duty to fight reactionary populism, a view shaped by the rise of the National Front in France. He sees Brexit as a strain of this politics and has pushed for the hardest line against Britain.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

These people do not.”While he said “we should not exaggerate the threat”, he then went on: “Obviously the threat as it is, is that whilst it won’t succeed itself which is absolutely guaranteed in my view, it may damage us.”Obviously the threat as it is, is that whilst it won’t succeed itself which is absolutely guaranteed in my view, it may damage usMr Lansman said Momentum – created in the wake of Mr Corbyn’s first leadership victory to support his left-wing policy agenda – will now use its campaigning force in the constituencies of the MPs who left the party this week to build pressure for by-elections.All have rejected calls from Labour’s top team to test the support of their local electorates.“We’re going to be collecting signatures for petitions in those constituencies,” he said. “Calling for by-elections. Having been elected on the basis of the manifesto that they are now rejecting – do the honourable thing.”Labour’s Thornberry says ‘I’d rather die than join another party’During a surprise press conference on Monday, Ms Berger was one of seven MPs to announce they were quitting Labour to form the Independent Group in the Commons.Asked whether he believed more resignations were to follow in the coming days, Mr Lansman replied: “I don’t know the iniduals concerned well enough. I hear rumours and they may have some foundation – I hope not.”“Compared to our current voting intention figures, it’s clear that the Independent Group are taking support from the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats – though it’s Labour who take the biggest knock,” the pollsters said.\u0026nbspBut Mr Lansman dismissed the findings, adding: “I think polls taken on the basis of today’s headlines for an organisation that has not said anything about what it stands for have to be taken with a great deal of scepticism. I think it will be some time before the polls yield anything like accurate information.”\u0026nbspKicked out of the party in the 1980s by then leader Neil Kinnock, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council caused controversy at the time for overseeing an illegal “deficit” budget in protest at Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government.\u0026nbspWhile Mr Lansman said that it should be possible for iniduals to be given a hearing by Labour’s governing body – the National Executive Committee – for possible readmission, he added: “I’m sceptical however, I am certainly not enthusiastic about his readmission to the party – let me put it that way.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

One of the questions they are bound to discuss is: who is going to be their leader? Our chief political commentator assesses the candidates.\u0026nbspThe early favourite. Heidi Allen, one of the Conservative defectors, said she thought it was “obvious” it should be him. This caused some irritation among other members of the group who thought this was taking the idea of being liberated to say what they think too far.\u0026nbspUmunna is an articulate communicator who was already the most visible face of the campaign for a second referendum and – we have an interest to declare – a columnist for The Independent.\u0026nbspHis negatives are a string of positions taken in the past from which he has now moved on, such as voting to invoke Article 50 and arguing to leave the EU single market, and a reputation for indecision dating from the time when he pulled out of standing for the Labour leadership after a few days in 2015.\u0026nbspHe has the advantage of plainly wanting the post – “I want to play the biggest role that I possibly can,”\u0026nbsphe told The Times yesterday – but his strongest claim may be that he has been the organising force of the week’s defections, which, with the exception of Joan Ryan and Ian Austin, were coordinated by Umunna’s staff through his House of Commons office.The star of the launch of the new group on Monday, she came into the room first and spoke first, with real sincerity and clarity. Even her opening mistake, introducing herself as “the Labour MP for…” before correcting to just “the MP for Liverpool Wavertree”, was a testament to the personal struggle each of the defectors has been through to give up longstanding party identity.\u0026nbspIt would send a powerful message to the Labour Party, which has yet to have a permanent female leader, for her to lead the Independent Group, the first parliamentary group to have a majority of female members (seven women and four men).\u0026nbspBut there are practical problems in that she is eight months pregnant if she were chosen as leader the group would need a deputy to stand in for a while.\u0026nbspThe most experienced of the group, having served as a minister, attending cabinet if never a full cabinet minister. Huge confidence and a forceful speaker. Tendency to speak her mind to the extent of saying, unhelpfully for the rest of the group, that she supported George Osborne’s fiscally responsible policies as chancellor in the coalition government.\u0026nbspIt would also be curious positioning for the group to have a former Conservative as leader, when the richer recruiting grounds are on the Labour benches in the House of Commons.\u0026nbspThat said, the Conservative defectors are valuable to the group’s identity with the voters outside parliament, giving it a cross-party appeal and cutting against what would otherwise be the group’s image as simply a reversion to the pre-Corbyn Labour Party.\u0026nbspSoubry would therefore be a strong contender as deputy leader.\u0026nbspIf she hadn’t already endorsed Umunna as leader, Allen could have been a contender herself. She was the star of the Tory defectors’ event on Wednesday, in that she was the least known of the three and yet came across well.\u0026nbspNone of the three seems to be a traditional Conservative, but Allen has often sounded like a Labour MP in the House of Commons.\u0026nbspLast week, for example, she asked Theresa May to end the benefits freeze at Prime Minister’s Questions, and at the launch of the three defectors she said the government had “deepened” the suffering of people on benefits, “while having the power to fix it”.\u0026nbspThe strength of the Independent Group is that it has several members who could easily lead a political party. Leslie is another experienced politician, having been the youngest postwar minister at the cabinet office at the age of 29 in 2001, and even serving briefly as shadow chancellor for four months after Ed Balls lost his seat in 2015.\u0026nbspHis waspish sense of humour was on display on BBC Question Time this week. Andy McDonald, the sacrifice offered by the Labour Party, said it was dealing with the problem of antisemitism and mentioned the report by Shami Chakrabarti. “Baroness Chakrabarti?” asked Leslie, adding that he thought there was a problem with an “independent” inquiry carried out by someone immediately elevated to the shadow cabinet via the House of Lords.\u0026nbspIf Umunna has second thoughts about the leadership, and Berger doesn’t want it, Leslie could capably step into the breach.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I don’t think anywhere else would warm to that,” he told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme.Prof Goodwin said Labour’s economic policies were generally popular, as was\u0026nbspthe Tory agenda on immigration. But he suggested there was little pent-up demand for an economically and socially liberal party, as the Independent Group appears to be.“I would argue that actually voters are not in that space, that voters are basically looking for a party that’s a bit left-wing on economics (and) more right-wing on cultural issues,” he said.“That, of course, is not where this new party is aiming for.”While the\u0026nbspcollective’s Tory defectors backed government\u0026nbspausterity measures, former Labour MP Chris Leslie has revealed the group opposes renationalisation and is against increasing the top rate of tax to 50 per cent – policies that polls have\u0026nbspshown to be\u0026nbsprepeatedly\u0026nbsppopular.MPs\u0026nbsp(Getty)Deborah\u0026nbspMattinson, pollster with the Britain Thinks research group, said the election system\u0026nbsp“is stacked against” a big change in the political landscape.“There is a gap, but I would say that in a way the gap isn’t a policy one – it’s a leadership gap,” she said.“People are looking for a different kind of leadership, and actually when we dig down to what people\u0026nbspare really dissatisfied with, it is about the two leaders that are being served up to them at the moment.”Earlier this week a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll found that 14 per cent of the public would vote for the Independent Group if it put up candidates at a general election. A Sky Data poll found 10 per cent of voters willing to back the group, while a\u0026nbspSurvation\u0026nbsppoll put it at\u0026nbsp8 per cent.‘Funny tinge’ proves that the real progressives stand with CorbynAnthony Wells, YouGov’s research director, said his own company’s poll showed the new grouping was “taking support from the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats – though it’s Labour who take the biggest knock”.Leo\u0026nbspBarasi, public opinion expert, said he thought it was too early to tell what kind of support the group might be able to build.Independent Group will back May in any vote of confidence, says AllenChuka Umunna ‘obvious’ candidate to lead new Independent Group“At the moment we’re polling an idea of something, rather than something specific… it feels like these numbers have the potential to change very dramatically, possibly in either direction,” he told the\u0026nbspPolling Matters\u0026nbsppodcast.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has already offered to work with the new group, hinting at a possible electoral pact by saying it would be “foolish” for them to stand candidates against each other.Yet Chris Leslie, one of the original seven MPs who formed the group, said although they would be willing to cooperate with MPs from all parties, “we are not joining the Liberal Democrats”.One of the big issues to be resolved by the breakaway MPs, if it does set up formally as a political party, is settling on a leader.Two of the Conservative defectors, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry,\u0026nbspsaid on Friday that ex-Labour shadow minister Chuka Umunna would be the “obvious” person to lead the group.“You need to establish quite quickly who your leader is going to be, and get your message out there,” Ms Mattinson\u0026nbsptold Today. “The best moment is quite early on when you’ve still got a blank canvas.”Just hours after the launch of the group, which was set up partially in response to accusations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, it was caught up in a row over racist language used by one of its members on live TV.Angela Smith later apologised for referring to ethnic minority people as being “a funny tinge”, claiming she had been “very tired”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I have absolutely no idea what is going on.Brexit is like the UK took a motorway exit, then found the road turning into a rutted grassy track, and now the car\u0027s stuck in a muddy field, there\u0027s no help in sight, it\u0027s getting dark, everyone\u0027s shouting at the driver, and the passengers are beginning to worry about food.Watching Brexit is like watching someone try and plug a coaxial aerial cable into a HDMI port. There is a lot of anger, a lot of swearing, and a lot of remarks about how this used to work before.#Brexit is like going back to Windows 3.1I\u0027m sure most people remember a kid at school who just lied constantly? Who refused to back down, however outlandish the lie, and however it was disproven?Trying to extricate ourselves from the EU, and Brexit, is like a multiple transplant patient attempting to give all the donated organs back.Paying my taxes to pay for Brexit is like asking a guy on death row if he has any change to put in the meter for the electric chair.Brexit is like watching Bandersnatch with your bae where bae is 70,000 Conservative party members hogging the PlayStation controller \u0026amp  choosing the most WTF option every time.!Brexit is like the shit that never comes. Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.The official Foreign Office take, retweeted by Mr Hunt, was a social media message about the foreign secretary visiting four European capitals and insisting: “It is possible to find a way through this, of course it’s challenging, of course there are difficulties but there is a solution.”Jeremy Hunt says EU shares responsibility to prevent no-deal BrexitDisobliging members of the British public have replied to that tweet by observing: “He’s certain to be winning friends and influencing people with his cringeworthy ignorance of the ex-Yugoslav nations,”\u0026nbspand: “You did really well in Slovenia, Jeremy. They love you now!”It is not unprecedented for Mr Hunt to make unfortunate comments on his first diplomatic missions to countries.Jeremy Hunt lobbies Germany to lift ban on arms sales to Saudi ArabiaHunt slapped down by Downing Street for suggesting Brexit delayHe marked his first visit to Beijing as foreign secretary by trying to impress his hosts by saying his wife is Japanese.\u0026nbspShe is actually Chinese, and as Mr Hunt acknowledged, it was a “terrible mistake to make”.The two nations have been rivals for centuries and Chinese memories remain raw of Japan’s brutal occupation of parts of their country during the 1930s and 1940s.The Independent has asked the Foreign Office for comment.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470186283-e1550618418677.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remainer brexit lies honda swindon","story":"They even dispute the car giant’s own bosses bluntly and repeatedly spelling out that it “is not related to Brexit”.It simply must be. They need it to be.The facts, though, are that Japan no longer needs to make cars in Europe because the EU trade deal it has finally signed will cut its export tarfs to zero.Hence its Turkish plant closing too.Meanwhile the UK factory has struggled for years, making far fewer cars than it once did, with sales falling and the war on diesels forcing Honda to refocus on electric vehicles.It is vital that Government incentives and a low-tax economy lure another big employer to Swindon to prevent these devastating and traumatic job losses.But it is grim to see some Remainers concerned only with weaponising them against Brexit, while sniggering that the Wiltshire town voted Leave.BREXIT uncertainty is spooking some firms. But they’re a minority judging by the remarkably rosy new pay and jobs figures.Wages up . per cent, their fastest since . And with inflation down to . per cent, those pay rises count.Employment is at a record high of .million.

None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds. I always heard about how Islam meant peace and how the Prophet was well known for being kind, honest and gentle.Now, thanks to the actions of Begum and her ilk, people sneer when they hear the phrase “Religion of peace”.The truth is, that in the Koran there are strict rules about warfare. You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or about the Tories, under their most left-wing leader in a generation, in fact being ruled by compassionless brutes.It’s window dressing aimed at disguising their sole obsession, a catastrophically isive second Brexit referendum.Perhaps they need to justy it to themselves. Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity. The Tories’ recruitment shts the entire focus.Their anti-Brexit arguments, though, are the same old Remoaner claptrap.Soubry even trotted out the feeblest of all, counting non-voters to claim  per cent of us did not back Brexit: A child’s logic, applying to every election ever.Allen claimed they heard the “clarion call for change” from .million Leave voters. They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations. The fact this is the brainchild of Oliver “Poll Tax” Letwin should tell you what chaos it will unleash.Which is doubtless why the EU is going cold on compromising. Why should it,Remainers will postpone Brexit Tory Leave MPs must not assume this will fail. Brexit is in mortal danger.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This girl was a victim when she went out there at  years old.“Our politicians are saying that she should be denied protections and due process that would have been granted to Nazis.”Labour declined to comment.Mr McDonnell’s comments came in a letter to then Home Secretary Theresa May.He said she should censure Brits serving in the Israeli Defence Force .A Labour party spokesman explained that the call came during the height of “barbaric bombing and attacks on Gaza where hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children were being killed”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A man raised by Jewish parents to battle anti-Semites, only to watch the party he loved for  years become a safe space for them.There was no regretful farewell from Corbyn’s malevolent mob. Only the sniping insults of Chris Williamson, a fan of Venezuela’s vicious tyranny and probably Parliament’s most odious MP.What a state the Opposition is now in.But the “moderates” who remain are in denialthey think it can be saved.Labour peer Lord Bragg tells The Sun he hopes for a new leader — and to “change it from within”. That is even less likely than “reforming” the EU.Corbyn and his cronies have won. Ed Miliband and others gted the party to them. And replacing Corbyn would change nothing... without the entire shadow cabinet, Corbynite officials and hard-left membership being ousted too.It won’t happen. Fantasising about it is self-indulgent and delusional.THE Sun has always said Corbyn would betray Labour’s Leave voters in the end. Watch it happen next week.It will be an unprecedented democratic outrage for a main party to back a second referendum before the first is enacted. But Corbyn says that is now “very much part of the agenda”.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell admits the party is “moving towards a people’s vote”, even using the Remainer- run ­campaign’s deceitful nickname.The vast majority of Labour’s at-risk marginal seats, and those they need to win to take power, backed Leave.And those voters are watching.THEY’RE not short of ego, are they The new -strong Independent Group of MPs say their ultimate aim is to form a Government. As it stands they can just about form a Sunday league side.Andwe were in any doubt their only real policy so far is to overturn Brexit, Ian Austin’s refusal to join clinches it.As for a “new kind of politics”, all we see is a club of centre-ground Europhile Labour and Tory MPs who vaguely agree they preferred Blairrunning the show.Forget the spin.

where she had been staying with her dad Robert MacPhail, , and grandparents - for the day to attend the celebration at softplay centre Dinom, near her mother Georgina Lochrane’s home in Airdrie, Lanarkshire.She had been escorted there on July , by her doting grandfather, -year-old George Lochrane, who was eager to spend time with his “wee pal” during her summer break.But little did he know that would be the last time he would see his darling granddaughter alive, as the youngster travelled back to Bute later that day and that night would be abducted as she slept by the “monster” teenager, who was armed with a kne.Today, as The Scottish Sun exclusively print the precious snaps, Alesha’s heartbroken mother Georgina, , wishing she could turn back time, saidshe’d only taken Alesha home with her, she could have been kept safe from the clutches of the Bute beast.Instead excited Alesha ed on the ferry and just hours later was taken in the night by cannabis and computer games obsessed psycho.Brave Georgina said: “He clearly had this well planned and well thought through.“If it wasn’t Alesha it would have been another child andhe wasn’t caught we have would have more kids killed by that monster.“She had gone on July , just hours before that ‘thing’ got to her.“She had gone over to Bute on the Thursday and this party was on the Sunday and she went back to Bute after the party.”On that tragic evening, Alesha been tucked up in bed by dad Robert MacPhail at .pm, after enjoying watching a Peppa Pig DVD.Hours later, boozed-up Campbell crept into her dad’s house at am – which was a five minute walk from his house – and snatched the youngster from her bedroom, subjected her to a savage sexual attack and smothered her to death.The callous brute was then caught on CCTV casually ing home for a shower.We told yesterday how shattered Georgina revealed how she had a mother’s instinct something was wrong – and woke up consumed by an inexplicable ache for her little girl hours before she learned she was missing.And she was horried to read online tributes from strangers as police launched a search.On Thursday a jury found the teenage maniac - who was obsessed with the horror character Slender Man – unanimously guilty of her rape and murder after a nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow.The trial heard how Alesha suffered  separate injuries at the hands of the warped psycho.He smothered her to death after subjecting her to a sick sexual attack in a secluded spot after carrying her there.The jury heard incontrovertible proof of his guilt - including damning billion-to-one DNA evidence linking him to the crime scene - and chilling CCTV footage showing him skulking from his mum’s home the night of the slaughter.They ed a unanimous verdict prompting Alesha’s outraged dad Robert, , to shout “f*****g scumbag” as cruel Campbell was led to the cells in handcuffs.Just seconds before Lord Matthews had told Campbell: “Alesha MacPhail was a sweet, angelic little girl.“She would’ve gone home to her mother looking forward to tell stories to her and her friends.“Instead of that you came into her le and stole her le.”Lord Matthews also told the High Court in Glasgow the case “was one of the wickedest and most evil crimes in the history of this court”.The twisted teen was not able to be named throughout the hearing because of his age and had been referred to as ‘AC’ whenever the trial was called over the court tannoy.But a ban on identying Campbell was lted on Friday.Tony Graham QC - representing the media - argued it was in the “public interest” for the teen to be exposed.Judge Lord Matthews agreed to lt the ban on identying the killer.Following the decision, we told how the child’s mother wanted him to “rot in jail” and her grandfather wished he had been hanged.And later Alesha’s heartbroken parents – who split just months after Alesha was born – each changed their profile picture to one of their little girl wearing a fireman’s hat – which was now emblazoned with angel wings.The heart-warming act saw friends and family leave dozens of heartfelt and encouraging messages in memory of the “angel”.Pal Dayna Hughes wrote: “Beautul so she is Genie”, while another Kathleen Quinn added: “Just perfect.”Meanwhile on Rab’s profile, Stephanie Mcdowall wrote: “Fly high beautul angel, as Theresa Minnes added: “Chin up Rab. You’ll have your own wee angel everywhere you go…Fly high beautul.”His pal, John Bell added: “Think of you and the family mate, keep the chin up.”Campbell – who was accused of killing and skinning cats by islanders – will be sentenced next month pending reports about his mental state.His name will also be put on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000349636555.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"microsoft workers bosses pull deal us military headsets","story":"The firm’s intention with their latest headsets, HoloLens, has prompted at least  Microsoft employees to pen a letter.Microsoft agreed a deal with the US military to give troops up to ,  of the futuristic holographic headsets to help them find enemies on the battlefield in November.A letter was sent around the firm yesterday and was backed by employees across ious departments.The letter seen by BBC reads: “Microsoft must stop in its activities to empower the US Army’s ability to cause harm and violence.“We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used.”It projects virtual images onto the real world and the wearer can interact with the graphics by moving their hands and fingers.Thermal sensing, night vision and the ability to check for vital signs such as breathing are requested to be part of the HoloLens.The technology was first announced in January  and is not available to the public.A Microsoft spokesperson said: “We always appreciate feedback from employees and have many avenues for employee voices to be heard.”It is the first time Microsoft employees have spoken out against the company’s work with government entities.The multi-million-pound contract states the goal is to “increase lethality by enhancing the ability to detect, decide and engage before the enemy”.Microsoft’s president and top lawyer Brad Smith has said employees who are not happy with the firm’s military work will be allowed to move to other departments.However, the letter claims the firm doesn’t tell its engineers about the intent of the software they are developing.It continues: “Microsoft fails to inform its engineers on the intent of the software they are building.These engineers have now lost their ability to make decisions about what they work on, instead finding themselves implicated as war profiteers.Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory already uses the HoloLens to project holograms of Mars Rover images giving scientists the ability to explore the red planet."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000405750581.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remember nicki waterman by raising tumour treatment cash","story":"Through private pioneering immunotherapy treatment Nicki managed to prolong her le and was convinced it could one day offer a cure to NHS patients throughout the UKthere was enough investment into research.Now this research is finally taking place to find that cure and the first trial of NHS patients has started - but without more charitable donations it won’t have the funds to continue to the next stages.That’s why today the Sun on Sunday has teamed up with Alex, , and her best friend Hayley Costa, , whose mum Beverly also tragically died from a brain tumour five-years-ago to launch the ‘Use Your Brain Campaign’ to help raise this money.Alex said: “Mummy just wanted to help everyone - and she inspired me to follow in her footsteps.“There was very little anyone could do for her when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. We don’t currently have effective treatments to offer patients but by raising money for research we can help fight this cruel cancer together.”They are the biggest cancer killer of children and adults under  yet just two per cent of the £ million yearly research budget goes into looking for cures for brain tumours.Immunotherapies are the great hope in cancer medicine. They are drugs that harness the body’s own ability to kill cancer cells and it allowed Nicki, who died in August  aged just , the precious extra time to see her son Harry get married.And it was what Baroness Tessa Jowell turned to in Germany after running out of options in London.Nicki’s doctor, medical oncologist Paul Mulholland from The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, has already started the trial on NHS patients across the UK.The National Brain Appeal charity has helped raise nearly half of the £, target needed for the initial research but they need help to raise the rest.Paul told us: “A new approach is needed for the treatment of brain cancer. We are aiming to bring together the newest drugs together with the latest developments in scientic research to find a cure for this devastating disease.“This will be achieved through a rolling programme of clinical trials. Our first trial is open and is currently recruiting.It is called the IPI-GLIO immunotherapy trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma brain cancer patients in the UK.The next phase will be to run multiple, smaller trials where the trial design will be adapted depending on the results that are obtained.“This is the quickest route to finding a cure for brain cancer.“The National Brain Appeal is fund-raising for this programme of clinical trials. Without this valuable help this programme would not have started and NHS brain cancer patients are being treated with new drugs today thanks to the charity.“This was something that Nicki Waterman wanted and felt passionate about. She had access to immunotherapy treatment due to having private healthcare and she wanted this to be extended to NHS patients.“I’m sorry that Nicki is not here to see this achievement given that she was so powerful in raising awareness to help to make it happen. It is admirable how Nicki’s daughter Alex and her friend Hayley have turned the tragedy of losing their mothers into something positive by raising awareness of brain cancer and helping to raise money for these clinical trials.”Almost , people are diagnosed each year with a primary brain tumour -  people every day and they reduce le expectancy by on average  years - the highest of any cancer. Just  per cent of adults survive for five years after diagnosis.Alex and Hayley tragically know just how cruel this disease can be. Alex - speaking ahead of Brain Tumour Awareness Month which starts next week - said: “Brain tumours are so common, so deadly but yet receive such little funding. This is about finding a cure. I am so excited about these trials - and raising money to make sure that cure is found.“The Use Your Brain Campaign is about spreading some happiness while raising money and awareness.“Taking part is simple. We are asking people to do something kind - by giving a kind word to somebody who seems a bit down, stopping to chat to an elderly neighbour or just by listening to a friend in need - and then take a thumbs up selfie with the tag #useyourbrain.“And then the vital bit - donate to the appeal to help the research and stamp out this dreadful cancer.“I hope that this campaign spreads some happiness, kindness and fun too. We can all spare a couple of minutes a day to be kind to each other. It’s a no brainer!”Theresa Dauncey, Chief Executive of The National Brain Appeal, said that investment in brain cancer research has been ‘abysmal’She told us: “There is an urgent need for new treatments for this devastating disease We are so grateful to Alex, Hayley and the Sun on Sunday for their enthusiasm and support to help raise both awareness and funds for Dr Paul Mulholland’s clinical trials.”     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hes got a lot of support and hes going to be vindicated on all these charges.Asked about the accusers, the lawyer added: I think all the women are lying, yes.This has become, Hey, R Kelly — I can say R Kelly did something — boom.There was a press conference yesterday — Oh, these two girls were assaulted by R Kelly! And the lawyer stood there with a picture of LL Cool J!He was referring to new claims he raped a  year-old fan while her friend hid in a hotel bathroom after he demanded a threesome.That alleged incident in Baltimore is not included in the ten charges filed against the star last night.Kelly, , is accused of abusing four victims — three of them aged from  to  — between  and .If convicted he faces three to seven years on each count, said Cook County States Attorney Kimberly Foxx.The charges came after campaigning lawyer Michael Avenetti uncovered video that allegedly shows R Kelly having sex with a girl who says on camera she is .Mr Greenburg said: I dont know what the tape is. We havent seen it. No ones showed us the tape.He claimed prosecutors had bowed to public pressure following allegations in the Netflix documentary Surviving R Kelly.He also said one of the charges appears to be linked to a decade-old case for possessing child abuse images.The singer was acquitted in  of having a tape that prosecutors claimed showed him having sex with a girl aged .His lawyer said: Double jeopardy should bar that case. He won that case.Earlier Kelly was driven to a Chicago police station in a van with tinted windows before making his way through the gathered media - during which he refused to answer questions.Mr Greenberg said Kelly was extraordinarily disappointed and depressed and adding: He is shellshocked by this.Celeb lawyer Michael Avenatti - who says he represents two of R Kellys alleged victims - said the charges marked a watershed moment.He said on Twitter: Its over. After  years of serial sexual abuse and assault of underage girls, the day of reckoning for R Kelly has arrived.Mr Avenatti said he began a thorough investigation last April after a concerned parent approached his office.Last week he gave prosecutors an explicit -minute tape featuring a man who appears to be R Kelly performing multiple sex acts with the girl, CNN reported.She and the singer refer to her age ten times, according to reports, and she calls him daddy.The man allegedly asks the girl to urinate before he urinates on her, the broadcaster claims.Kelly has faced claims of sexual abuse for more than two decades.The Surviving R Kelly documentary revealed harrowing accounts of his alleged abuse.The programme claimed he ran an abusive cult in which he allegedly kept women captive.Kellys lawyers dismissed the documentary as another round of stories being used to fill reality TV time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471237050.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ben mcbean becomes dad taliban explosion","story":"But war hero Ben McBean, who defied the odds to become a dad after suffering groin injuries in the Taliban bomb blast that cost him his limbs, has got it all worked out.The former Marine, dubbed “Harry’s hero” after he flew back from Afghanistan on the same flight as the Prince, declared: “In fact I am better at doing it than the missus!”Speaking about his joy at his unexpected fatherhood as he posed with son Albie,  months, and partner Zara, , Ben added: “Looking back, all the struggles have been worthwhile.“I am so glad I never gave up because now I have Albie and it’s the greatest thing in the world.”Millies Award winner Ben, , who had to have a testicle removed due to injuries caused by the explosion, also joked: “At least it all still works down there and my one remaining testicle was up to the task.”The former Commando, of Plymouth, Devon, lost his right leg and left arm when he stepped on a mine in February  while on patrol in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province. He was just  years old.Ben was one of two injured Marines to share a flight back to the UK with Prince Harry.The royal was forced to come home after his secret frontline mission was revealed.Ben admits becoming a dad was the furthest thing from his mind as he set out on the path to recovery.It was a long journey — with his groin injury requiring a new op long after the blast.He explained: “It was not until two years after the explosion that I had the testicle removed and a  one put in. I wasn’t that worried about a testicle after all I had been through.“I was only  when I was blown up, and back then I only had myself to think about and didn’t knowI’d ever get a girlfriend let alone become a dad.“I was given a choice about the operation to remove a ­testicle but told it could affect the other oneI kept it.“So looking back, that was a good choice and a wise ­decision, although I really wasn’t thinking about kids.“I had hundreds of injuries with shrapnel wounds all over my body, and still have shrapnel in me so it wasn’t that big a deal for me.”As he recovered, Ben met old schoolmate Zara, who is a nurse, in a pub on a night out in Plymouth.Ben — who won a Sun Overcoming Adversity Millie in  — recalled: “We got on well and just started chatting. We knew each other but weren’t close at school, and when I was back in Plymouth and doing rehab I bumped into a few old school people.“Zara is chilled and good fun. We have a normal relationship — it used to be date nights, but now it’s boxsets.”The lovebirds — who have been together for five years — did not plan the pregnancy but were overjoyed when Zara discovered she was expecting.Ben had never asked medics about his parenthood chances or had a sperm count or checks on his other testicle.He said: “We were shocked but extremely happy I have always wanted kids and when it happened and Zara got pregnant it was a surprise. It was not planned.“The only conversation we ever had about it was a jokey one with her saying, ‘Are you all right down there ’“I didn’t know but just said, ‘Yes, of course.’“But there’s only one way to find out, isn’t there — and I have proved it works!”Such a happy future was something Ben could never have imagined in .He said: “When I was first injured I thought, ‘I am in so much pain I’d rather be dead.’“It has been dficult to stay positive because there is nothing positive about having your arm and leg blown off.“I have had my struggles and now it all feels worthwhile. Now I look at Albie and often think, ‘Le isn’t so bad.’ ”But becoming a dad threw up fresh challenges — similar to the ones he faced in the aftermath of the explosion.He explained: “The birth was great, but to be honest having a child was scary.“Everyone who becomes a parent is nervous but I guess it was more so for me.“It was a bit like when I was first injured and had to figure out things like getting dressed when I only had one arm. But you adapt to it and work things out.“Now I can change a nappy with one arm — I use my stump leg to hold Albie’s legs up and now he’s a bit older he helps me out, too. I also figured out a way of getting him in the car seat, by clawing both bits together. I like to take him to the park but I know I’ll miss out on certain things like playing football with him and running around.”Ben has prosthetics including a walking and running leg and a  arm, but rarely wears them when he is at home with Zara and Albie. He continued: “It is a pain when you do things like make two cups of tea and have to make two ­journeys to get them.“But Zara and Albie help out a lot and Albie carries things for me, like his iPad.” Although they have no immediate plans to add to the family, Ben and Zara would like more children.The former  Commando Marine said: “In the future I think we will have more but we are not in a rush and are happy with our lives at the moment.”Brave Ben, who in  became the first double amputee to complete the London Marathon, was initially handed a compensation payout of just £, for his horric injuries. It was later raised to £,.He invested some of the money in property, making money from buying and ­selling around Plymouth.But for the last two years, the war hero has been beset by more health problems.“It was a case of one step forward, two steps back and I had a lot of problems so have calmed down in the last couple of years.“I also suffered mentally — and one morning could not face getting out of bed.“I was thinking about Afghanistan a lot and having flashbacks. You get to the point you feel like jumping out of a window.“I went downhill and kept myself to myself.“I had what I guess was PTSD and I went to the ­doctor. I was given anti- depressants which I took for a while.“But I thought, ‘This isn’t helping — these are just sedating me, not making it better’ so I processed the problems myself.“I try to stay happy and positive but it is not easy because you never forget about losing your arm and your leg — you never fully recover.“I am soon going to have the th anniversary of being blown up, but I have Zara and Albie with me, which is great.”Ben now works as a motivational speaker, giving talks to banks and businesses.He said: “My story is now better, as there is more to it and it’s not just a case of how I got injured and ­survived. I enjoy it and a few weeks ago I gave a talk to , people at the Excel Arena in London. That was nerve-racking!”And Ben has inspiring words for dad-to-be and old pal Prince Harry, who dubbed Ben the “real hero” after they jetted home together.Ben said: “I am glad he is doing well.“He has had his struggles with losing his mother and what he saw in Afghanistan — he saw injures like mine first-hand.“I am happy he’s with Meghan and they are ­expecting. He obviously loves her and that is great.“We have both been through and seen a lot.“I’m sure I’ll see him again and I’ll congratulate him and wish him the best.”BEN McBEAN is a true hero.He almost paid the ultimate sacrice in Afghanistan, losing an arm, a leg and also part of his groin to a Taliban landmine.So it is wonderful news that, against the medical odds, the former commando has become a father for the first time.Ben and his young family are a supreme lesson in overcoming adversity.We salute you, Superdad!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That moment is forever in my head.Alfie went on to defy doctors expectations and lived for another five days - with his doting parents at his side the whole time.In total, the toddler spent the final  months of his le in Alder Hey Hospital.Alfie was born in May  and for the first six months of his le appeared a healthy and happy little boy.But doctors later diagnosed him with rare GABA transaminase deficiency - and revealed the heartbreaking news that there was nothing more they could do for him.A series of courts agreed with doctors decisions, prompting desperate Tom and Kate to campaign for him to be kept on le support in the hope he could be taken abroad for le-saving experimental treatment.Tom even met with Pope Francis who supported the couples fight for their son - but ultimately his le support machine was switched off.The parents continue to seek grief counsellors - with Tom saying: We are still understanding how to grieve.He added: I want to be more happy around Thomas, I don’t want him to see me crying all the time or with a bad face.“He needs a happy environment. I need to understand how to be happy.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471388497-e1550966224230.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vegan youtube tim shieff clothing ethcs","story":"Tim Shieff, , who campaigned on vegan issues and is a world champion free-runner, confessed in an online video post last November he had ditched his plant-based diet because he was “desperate” to boost his health.He said he’d visited a local farm having finished a “-day water fast” where he only drank distilled water.After seeing two chickens running around, he bought two eggs and ate them raw.He said: “It sent me questioning everything.“A few days later I bought some wild salmon and tried that.”His confession was met by a fierce backlash online and his colleagues at ETHCS, the clothing company he founded three years ago, issued an apology and said they were “hurt and let down” by his admission.ETHCS – which deliberately misspells the word ethics - has now dropped him after he released further videos earlier this month saying he had completely abandoned a vegan diet.The company told a vegan newsite: “For a long time Tim had been an inspirational example for veganism, as well as a good friend who has inspired us all, but this lestyle change was something none of us could get on board with.“We have all been proud vegans for many years, and promoting the vegan message and ethical lestyle choices was very important to us all.“Considering ETHCS was founded on these same principles, we all agreed it would be bestTim stepped away from the company.

It was cold and cruel.The last time Amber saw her gran she dropped round a Mothers Day card while her mum and stepdad Danny waited outside in the car.Jenner claims that she tried to see the schoolgirl again but Kelly had changed her number.She added: “Amber was so loving. She spent weekends with me and every time she went home she’d leave notes saying things like ‘love you, Nanna’.”Her gran is convinced that more could have been done to save Ambers le.She said: How could Amber’s cries for help have gone unheard  People will say ‘lessons have been learned’ but it won’t bring her back.”An inquest into Ambers death this week revealed that authorities missed  chances to save her le.Amber would often run away from home and was “emotionally abused” by her stepdad Danny Peat, the Nottingham inquest was told.The teenager made ious complaints to teachers about her family le and once claimed that Mr Peat had woken her up at .am and made her mop their kitchen floor.Amber also concerned teachers when when they had to feed her a breakfast of biscuits before her SATS exams or when staff spotted her wearing baggy tracksuit bottoms to class rather than her unorm.The youngster also complained that she had been banned from having a birthday and that her mum smashed her mobile phone up.The coroner said Amber could still be aliveauthorities had done their job properly.Nottinghamshire Safeguarding Children Board is likely to publish a serious case review into the circumstances around the tragic teen’s death in the coming weeks.Concluding with a narrative verdict at the inquest at Nottingham Coroners Court on Friday, Ms Bower said: In evidence, both Mr and Mrs Peat sought to present as concerned parents.Mrs Peat said she repeatedly asked Amber what was wrong but she would not answer.Mrs Peat said that as soon as she heard the door slam, she went to look for Amber.Their behaviour in going to the supermarket and then the car wash, of leaving a missing Amber with no way of getting into the property, and of waiting some seven and a half hours before calling the police, in fact fits squarely with the picture that neither of them was concerned in the slightest when Amber left the house.She added: Perhaps in light of the tragic outcome, both Mr and Mrs Peat would wish to believe that they demonstrated more care when Amber went missing.Turning to agencies involved in Ambers welfare, the coroner said: Considering Ambers age, her emotional immaturity and her undoubted vulnerability, and the absence of any professional ever having properly assessed Ambers risk of self harm or suicide, I am not able to determine, on the balance of probabilities, Ambers intention at the time of her death.My task has been hindered by the lack of information gathered by professionals as to Ambers thoughts, wishes and feelings.If the right questions had been asked, the information may have presented itself but I cannot speculate as to what that information may have indicated.Mr and Mrs Peat admitted that neither of them were worried when Amber stormed out of her home in Bosworth Street, Mansfield, on May , , because they believed she was close by and expected her to .Despite the youngster having a history of running away, Mrs Peat only called police to report her missing nearly eight hours later, at . am the following day.She admitted she should have called sooner, when she gave evidence at the inquest.The couple decided to go shopping, have the family car washed and have tea, during the time the youngster was missing.Although up to  police staff were involved in the search for Amber, her body was only recovered on June .Ms Bower concluded the medical cause of death was hanging.Speaking on behalf of Mrs Peat outside Nottingham Coroner’s Court, solicitor Amy Robinson said: “Like all parents, Kelly knows she is not perfect, but she has done, and continues to be, the best parent she can for her children.“While Kelly does not agree with all of the coroner’s findings, the coroner’s conclusion was that with the right assessment and support from the education, health and social care agencies involved with Amber and her family, it is possible that Amber’s le may not have ended the way it did and when it did.“Kelly wonders whether things could have been dferent had Amber and her family received more support and advice for Amber’s behaviour.”If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems the Samaritans can be contacted on  , or visit Mind’s website."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471495924.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle gets henna tattoo as her and prince harry visit education boarding house in morocco","story":"The seven-months pregnant Duchess revealed the design to two young on a visit to a school in the Atlas mountains -

From September next year relationship classes will be mandatory in primary schools, sex education will be added in secondaries and classes on staying healthy for all pupils.

The Independent Group comes from a wide ersity of backgrounds, including a former lecturer, social worker, solicitor, entrepreneur, a GP and a church leader. We represent regions across the country, and in contrast to the heavily male-dominated Conservative and Labour Parties in Parliament, I’m proud that two thirds of our group is female. Where the established parties are out of touch and remote from people’s everyday lives, we’re a group of ordinary people who are seeking to do something which Westminster has forgotten how to do - represent modern Britain.   The experience of the last few years has made it clear for all to see that politics is broken. Poll after poll shows the public are crying out for politicians to roll up their sleeves and work together to solve the challenges we all face. Voters are understandably sick and tired of the same old partisan, tribal way of doing things which has let our country down for too long. It’s no surprise that people have switched off from political debate. Ultimately, the established parties’ failure stems from the way they’ve become increasingly narrow and factional, increasingly refusing to engage with other points of view. As a result, they’re incapable of showing the leadership we need and have failed to provide any sense of direction.  What has this meant in practice  Where the parties used to represent a ersity of traditions, they’ve become dominated by their extremes. The Tories have morphed into ‘Blukip’ where Jacob Rees Mogg’s ERG hold all the cards and the proud One Nation tradition has been lost. With Labour, we’ve seen disgraceful antisemitism flourish in a climate where no criticism of the party leadership is tolerated. And, in general, people feel they have to settle for voting for the least worst option or simply to make sure the other lot don’t get in. Many still vote for the established parties not because they want to but because they feel they have to. And whether you voted Leave or Remain in , the Brexit process has shown up the failure of both Labour and the Tories, and has left no one happy with what’s being delivered in the voters’ name. This week we have come together in the national interest, to say ‘enough is enough’. We have each put everything on the line to give something new a try. Believe me, it hasn’t been an easy decision for any of us. We don’t yet know the destination where the path we’ve taken will lead us. But what me and my Independent Group colleagues are absolutely clear about is that we cannot and must not re-create the old parties with their tribalism and incompetence. As we embark on this new chapter, most importantly we want you to help us build a new movement, and we’re keen to hear from you. Join us, and help us forge a new, dferent kind of politics for Britain’s future.

I have already done so.The property tycoon, who donated around pound. million to Labour over a period of  years, left the party in protest at the leaderships handling of the anti-Semitism row.But now he has thrown his weight behind the  Labour and  Tory MPs who quit their parties this week to form the so-called TIG. He told The Observer intimidation and bullying has become endemic in the Labour Party for all to see - and he now feels relief at abandoning Labour.He added: I have watched, with ever-growing concern, the deterioration, especially over the past year, of the extent and nature of the naked antisemitism which has increased throughout the Labour party and its supporters, since Jeremy Corbyn and his cabal of revolutionaries took control of the Labour party which I had so admired and supported with commitment and enthusiasm.Pimlico Plumbers founder Charlie Mullins, who previously donated to the Tories and then the Lib Dems, indicated to The Times on Saturday that he could also give TIG financial backing.  I believe that any money I put in to the Independent Group will be money well spent because I think Theresa May is destroying the economy, he said.This is about our children and grandchildren and the future of this country.Meanwhile Sadiq Khan warned there has been a collapse in trust between Labour and the Jewish community and said the last week had been the most distressing and depressing of my  years in the party.Many Jewish people feel Labour is unwilling to tackle anti-Semitism, he wrote, and Sadly, it’s now possible that the Jewish Labour Movement will never reach its -year anniversary. And the Mail on Sunday reports that Dame Louise Ellman could be the next MP to quit the Labour Party. A friend of the Jewish MP told the newspaper: Louise will not be in the party for much longer.  Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson today declared there is a crisis for the soul of the Labour Party, branded the situation perilous and demanded Jeremy Corbyn take personal control of the anti-Semitism row. He said he had sent a file of  Labour anti-Semitism cases to the Labour leader that he felt had been inadequately dealt with. But Labours Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner insisted the number of cases was a tiny proportion of the Labour membership and said just  alleged anti-Semites had been expelled or left in anticipation theyd been booted out.Earlier this week the new Independent Group of MPs claimed they had already had thousands of donations - and claimed they will declare them in due course.Because the group is not a registered political party, it does not have to declare donations unless they come to its inidual MPs.Critics claim donors could conceal their identities by donating to a company called Gemini A Ltd - a vehicle run by MP Gavin Shuker and based above a Wetherspoons in Altrincham called The Unicorn. Responding to the Mirrors queries over its status earlier this week, TIG MP Chris Leslie insisted the group will declare donations in due course - evenit is not legally required to by the Electoral Commission. He told us: Gemini A was Gavin Shukers clever idea for I guess he was thinking a launch or something. What weve said is we underwrote the room where we launched. And hopefully now with our crowdfunding, which is www.theindependent.group, weve had quite a good response from the public. Weve had thousands of people giving small sums and some wanting to give larger sums. Obviously the Electoral Commission have rules for political parties. While were not a political party yet, weve set out to say we will map over the rules on parties as though we were a political party and comply with the full disclosures of that. Mr Leslie said there were some requirements before publishing the names and amounts from donors - such as a value threshold.

John McDonnell and Peter Mandelson, and many others, have come together with the same messagecalling for unity, and arguing that this wrong decision will result in a long reign of Tory government. They are absolutely right. A split on the centre-left only benefits those on the Right. Whatever concerns these MPs have, you only have to look at history to see that the changes our country is crying out for only ever come about when Labour is in government.   From founding the NHS, setting up the Welfare State introducing the Equal Pay Act, establishing the National Minimum Wage to delivering Sure Start. A strong and powerful Labour is the ONLY route to a fairer Britain. But we do need to reflect too on the reasons why some MPs left. I’m sorry that my friend Luciana Berger was pushed out of our Party because of vile antisemitism and bullying. The Party leadership must redouble their efforts to root out this evil racism perpetrated by a minority of members.   The Momentum wing must also down tools and bring an end to internal point-scoring, the threats of deselections, and a belief that only one viewpoint is valid. We must all respect and value dferent opinions, and take the bile out of politics, on and offline. We must be a broad church. This has been one of the worst weeks in the history of the Labour Party. The challenge now is how we react to it. We can either come together stronger than ever, or fail the test we have been set, and be complicit in the longest reign of a destructive Tory government in a generation.

Little Thomas Evans is the double of Alfie – the -month-old who died after a heartbreaking legal battle by his parents. Thomas is six months old and his dad Tom today reveals how having a new baby has brought a joy he and partner Kate James feared they would never experience again. Tom, , told the Sunday Mirror: “Thomas is Alfie’s double, the resemblance is amazing. “When we see Thomas pull a face he looks like Alfie, we feel that in a way we have them both with us.  “He’s such a happy baby, he does nothing but smile. I had a great connection with Alfie and I feel like I’ve got the same with Thomas. “We’re hanging in there, keeping sane, doing as well as we can. I wouldn’t know where I was without baby Thomas. “I’ve got something to wake up to with him. I have to keep happy for Thomas’s sake. I wouldn’t want to wake upit wasn’t for the baby. “I don’t like to think what it would be like without Thomas. I worryhe wasn’t here, where would I be  “How would I be  What would my mental health be ”   Tom was speaking as he and Kate revealed a pound, fund for Alfie will be spent on helping sick children. The proud dad added: “When Thomas gets older we want him to understand what Alfie went through and he can know good came from it. We’d like to help children around the UK and the world.” The picture of Tom and Thomas is a ray of light after two years of pain and torment. Tom and Kate had fought to keep Alfie on a le support machine in a case which drew global attention. They lost, ultimately, and their son died at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital from an ultra-rare degenerative brain disease. Kate, , fell pregnant with Thomas as the legal battle – which taxed her and Tom to the limits – was played out. But the couple stayed together through those tough times and are now devoted to Thomas. Tom said: “Kate is a great mum for Thomas. She has moments when she’s upset and she has a cry. That’s what you have to do to release the emotion. Mums have that bond, especially with the first child.” He accused doctors of separating him and Kate in hospital and telling her that the legal battle was wrong. Tom went on: “It was hard. She questionedwe were doing the right thing. I told her what we were doing, what our friends and family were doing, was the right thing for Alfie. But it wasn’t easy. It was hard for her to hear the arguments of the doctors every day. There was a lot of strain, but we stayed together. “We both loved Alfie and both wanted the best for Alfie. “We remained tough. They were telling her I was wrong. She was pregnant and her hormones and emotions were all over the place.”  The arrival of Thomas triggered a wave of emotions for the couple. Tom explained: “I was nervous but felt happy. We had the test done and he didn’t have the same genes as Alfie, we were told he would be okay. “We were happy that Alfie had a brother, it’s just that Alfie wasn’t there with us. “It was hard because the first time we had a beautul boy and we lost him. “Then when we had Thomas there were tears of joy, but it felt dferent because we had lost our first boy. “We were the same parents Alfie had at home, just in a dferent position, more tense. “ We still speak about Alfie, but we don’t speak about the hospital. We talk about how he is going to help save a lot of children in the future.”  Tom tearfully told how he gave Alfie mouth-to-mouth as his le ebbed away in the early hours of April  last year. With tears rolling down his cheeks Tom said: “I think about that moment every day. That moment is forever in my head. “I was giving him mouth-to-mouth, I could hear him breathing, like a sigh. It gave me more encouragement to keep trying. The noises kept coming and coming. But Kate was saying ‘Stop it, you’re just expanding his belly’. I didn’t want to stop. But I knew he was dead. At the very last moment his colour went. “The police and doctors and nurses were looking through the door, standing there. “I said to them ‘Can’t you do anything ’ They pulled his le support out and thought he would die in three to four minutes. But he lived for five days. We put him on our knees and sang to him, cuddled him.   “I said right to the end that their treatment of him was shyinhumane. “I do feel bad for the nurses because they didn’t have the power. All they could do was stand and watch for five days while oxygen and food was withheld. Up until the last I thought we were going to save him. I tried every avenue. “I was just a dad who wanted the best for his son.” Alfie was born in May  and while initially healthy he fell seriously ill at six months old. He was in Alder Hey Hospital for the last  months of his le. Doctors found he had the rare brain condition GABA transaminase deficiency. They said there was nothing more they could do and advised that Alfie should be allowed to slip away. A court agreed – prompting Tom and Kate’s long battle to overturn the decision, in the hope that Alfie could be taken abroad for le-saving treatment. They appealed to UK and European judges and Tom even met Pope Francis, who backed the couple. But ultimately the courts ruled Alfie’s le support could be switched off. Tom said he and Kate still see grief and bereavement counsellors as they strive for the best way forward. And he is determined to stay strong. He added: “We are still understanding how to grieve. “I want to be more happy around Thomas, I don’t want him to see me crying all the time or with a bad face. “He needs a happy environment. I need to understand how to be happy.” Alfies legacy to help other seriously ill kids Alfies dad Tom says a pound, fund raised in his name will now help other seriously ill children. The sum came from an “Alfie’s Army” fundraising page set up during the legal battle to pay for potentially le-saving treatment in Italy or Poland. Hundreds of supporters also joined demonstrations in support of Alfie. The family has applied for charity status and has already provided wheelchairs and sensory equipment for disabled children. Tom said: “When we get something we think ‘Alfie bought it for them, Alfie is helping that person’. We’re happy that his name can live on in other parents’ and children’s minds.” The Alfie’s Army page states: “We don’t want any other family going through what we have... we are hoping to open a foundation to help other families get the help they need.” "},{"url":null,"title":"amber peats grandmother reveals last","story":"NewsAmber Peats grandmother reveals last gt tragic teen gave her before she diedEXCLUSIVE: Jenner Lancaster says her granddaughter Amber was let down by everyone before she was found hangedShareCommentsByGrace Macaskill :,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsJenner Lancaster has blasted social services in two counties for failing to help her granddaughter before her tragic death \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is the last gt her granddaughter gave her on the final day she saw her alive. And shyJenner Lancaster keeps it safe in a trinket box of memories. A Mother’s Day card from a tragic, troubled girl whose harrowing le was last week laid bare in a coroner’s court. Two years after that fleeting visit to her gran, Amber Peat was found hanged after running away from the last of the  homes her parents had moved her to. She was just . On Friday coroner Laurinda Bower ed a narrative conclusion on the youngster’s death, saying she could not be sure she intended to commit suicide. But she blasted education, health and social care agencies in two counties for missing  chances to save the tormented child. And she panned the girl’s mum and stepdad for showing “very little,any, consideration” for her welfare. “This is proof the authorities failed Amber,” says a tearful Jenner, , tenderly touching that treasured card. “She was let down by everyone. But it doesn’t change the outcome does it  Amber was a little girl crying out for help and nobody listened. How must she have been feeling in those final moments  “I’m sure she would have opened up to meshe hadn’t been forced to move away.”   The inquest heard allegations that Amber – whose body was found in woods near her home – suffered emotional abuse, and that her stepdad Danny “humiliated” her and gave her “severe punishments”. A teacher claimed the Cinderella schoolgirl told her the family’s dog was treated better than her. A policewoman told the court her mum Kelly dismissed her disappearance as just “attention seeking”. Today, her gran reveals how Kelly banned her from seeing Amber after that last visit on Mother’s Day, . Jenner’s son Adrian,  – Amber’s real dad – had split from Kelly in Christmas  after a turbulent -year relationship.  He has a conviction for domestic violence against her. “He’s no angel,” says Jenner. “But there’s no excuse for Kelly to have stopped Amber’s contact with me. It was cold and cruel. “Amber said she couldn’t stay long that day as her mum and Danny were waiting in the car. “I texted Kelly a couple of weeks later to askI could see her. I got a reply saying she wasn’t sure, then the whole family just up and left. When I called Kelly’s number she’d changed it. Her old neighbours had no idea where they’d gone. My heart was broken. “Amber was so loving. She spent weekends with me and every time she went home she’d leave notes saying things like ‘love you, Nanna’.”  Jenner was at the inquest every day, hoping to make sense of what happened. “I owed it to Amber,” she says. Nottingham Coroner’s Court heard how Amber had moved house “no less than  times” around Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. And social services in Derbyshire were already involved with the Peat family when they moved to Mansfield, Notts, in . When Amber started the local Queen Elizabeth school, staff there quickly grew worried. She told teachers her stepdad Danny would wake her at .pm to clean floors for two hours as punishment for failing to do chores. She said he made her wear baggy grey jogging bottoms to school and carry her belongings in a plastic bag instead of a satchel or backpack to humiliate her. He denied it. Form teacher Rebecca Beard told the inquest: “Amber said her dad wanted to get everyone to laugh at her.” The distraught schoolgirl told another teacher – after briefly running away from home in April  – that the family dog was treated better than her.  Six months before her death she wrapped a school tie around her neck and told pupils: “I hate my le. I want to kill myself.” Teachers twice tipped off Nottinghamshire social workers but were told that her case did not “cross the threshold” for intervention. Coroner Bower said Amber’s tragic death highlighted the lack of sharing of information between agencies in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. She said: “No one got to the point of how Amber was feeling because there was not that support in place.” Amber, who had two siblings, was found dead in June  after a row over cleaning a cool box after a family holiday in Cornwall. It was almost eight hours before Kelly, , and Danny, , reported her missing, after going shopping, out for dinner and to a carwash. Both denied all the allegations made at the inquest.  Now Jenner, who lives in Nottinghamshire, is left with that trinket box and a conviction that more could have been done to save her granddaughter. “How could Amber’s cries for help have gone unheard ” she says. “People will say ‘lessons have been learned’ but it won’t bring her back.” She is surrounded by pictures of Amber – as a baby, as a three-year-old playing by a duck pond, as a young girl nearing teens, posing elegantly. Jenner shows me a Christmas decoration Amber made from lollipop sticks. All the time she holds a green stone keyring Amber gave her. “It’s only a cheap thing she won at a fair, but it means everything to me. It’s one of the few things I have left of her.” Jenner says. Amber harboured dreams of being a model. “She loved having her picture taken and every time she came she’d get my make-up out to do herself up.”  But the vulnerable girl also yearned for her lost childhood. A youth worker who had sessions with Amber told the inquest her mother “laughed” at a letter her vulnerable daughter wrote saying she just wanted to be a little girl again. After the inquest verdict on Friday, Kelly said she had been had been “the best parent” she could. Jenner says: “Amber did everything she could to get help. She spoke to teachers, wrote to her mum, had youth worker sessions yet despite all of this a house move meant she fell off the radar.” All Jenner has left now is the memory of that last big hug before Amber left that Mother’s Day, out of her le forever. “I think about her from when I wake until I close my eyes. I have happy dreams in which I believe she comes to visit me. “I like to think it means Amber is finally at peace.” Scandal of lost chancesJan : Amber referred to Derbyshire social services by family’s GP.

Tracey Connelly was given an indefinite sentence after she admitted allowing her then-boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother to kill her son Peter in . But sources inside HMP Low Newton in County Durham told the Daily Star she planned to apply for parole by the end of the year. Connelly has apparently fallen in love with an old friend called Paul, and hopes to start again with him should she be released. She has been swooning about the County Durham jail, telling other inmates about her new relationship, according to the reports.  If she is released she plans to move in with Paul, away from the nastiness of the past, the newspaper said. Connelly pleaded guilty to standing by while her then lover Barker and his brother Jason Owen repeatedly abused and tortured her toddle son Peter. The tragic tot suffered injuries including a broken back, shattered ribs, missing fingernails and mutilated fingers - most of which were missed by social workers and doctors in the months leading up to his death in August . A post-mortem after Peter died found he had swallowed a tooth after being punched. Connelly was first released on licence in  but was recalled back to jail just  months later after she was accused of selling indecent images of herself.   She applied for parole again in December  but was turned down after officials decided she was still a danger to the public. But sources inside the prison told the Daily Star she believes her new beau could turn things around for her. She’s telling everyone around how she knows it’s the real deal because she knew him before she knew Steven . She said she knows he won’t be with her because of her notoriety. “The sad thing is when she was released last time she had loads of weirdos getting in contact with her, turned on by what she was imprisoned for. It makes you sick. “But she’s saying she knows this Paul, and he knows her from before.   Tracey was overheard telling people that Paul knows she is a ‘good person’ deep down and knows she isn’t this evil character people make her out to be. She is deluded.” Connelly was reportedly given permission to contact her family and other children last year, hoping to show prison bosses she has changed and deserves a second chance. It is her hope that by showing she is in a stable relationship parole chiefs will see she is changed, see she has somewhere already set up to go and start a new le and she should be able to keep out of trouble, the insider said. “Who knowsthey will buy it ” "},{"url":null,"title":"bouncy castle safety clamp down","story":"NewsBouncy castle safety clamp down after deaths of Summer Grant and Ava-May LittleboyEXCLUSIVE: Safety inspectors are clamping down on bouncy castles after it emerged hundreds or people are hurt on fairgrounds each yearShareCommentsByKeir Mudie:,  FEB NewsSummer Grant who died in a bouncy castle accident \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSafety inspectors are clamping down on bouncy castles and other inflatables after a series of injuries and deaths.

Closer to home, Tanya’s stepdad is showing similar resolve as he, too, faces the same issues. Tanya, who plays Rainie Cross in the BBC soap, said: “I have a family member who has Alzheimer’s. We’re dealing with that. “My stepfather will be in my sights, so will Barbara. “It’s a severely underfunded disease. We don’t know enough about it. The awareness has leapt this year and that’s got a lot to do with Barbara.” Scott Mitchell,  – hubby of TV’s much-loved Barbara,  – is also running the marathon.  And he and Tanya will be joined by a right collection of Cockneys in the form of EastEnders stars Adam Woodyatt, Jake Wood, Emma Barton, Natalie Cassidy, Kellie Shirley, Jamie Borthwick and Jane Slaughter. Training for the event has kept Tanya occupied while not playing TV’s Rainie. She and her character could barely be more dferent. Rainie is a former druggie and Tanya is teetotal and enjoys a quiet le with her partner James Barriscale in Kent. Her powerful performances as Rainie have touched families who have been ravaged by addiction. “Somebody recently came up to me in the street and said a family member of theirs had been going through a similar situation,” she told.  “As a family they’ve clocked into Rainie and over the years she’s been a formative character for them. Particularly when she was going through the crack addiction. Their family member was going through the same thing and they would watch Rainie. We have a social responsibility to tell the stories.” Tanya first set foot in Albert Square more than  years ago and loves every minute. The London-born star – who was seen last week at the West End version of Only Fools And Horses – had a special word to say about another EastEnders veteran, -year-old June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton. Tanya said: “June is wonderful. She’s still playing that iconic character. She comes on set with all the same ethics she’s ever had. Her integrity towards the work is absolutely paramount. She’s an inspiration to me and it’s an honour to work with her.” And Tanya also heaped praise on another inspirational actress – Olivia Colman, , who played Queen Anne in The Favourite and is up for the best actress award at tonight’s Oscars. The pair starred in Broadchurch together.   Tanya said: “I watched the filmwhen I was in LA. She’s amazing in it. I was mesmerised by her. I sent her a message straight after. “She’s not a showbiz person. She’s down to earth and fantastic at her job. It’s fantastic she’s being recognised. It’s encouraging as it reminds you it’s possible and that dreams do come true.” But Tanya doesn’t have any visions of Hollywood stardom herself. She added: “Rainie challenges me right across the gamut. There’s drama and comedy. I’m learning from her. If Rainie keeps challenging me like this I’m happy to stay.”To support the Barbaras Revolutionairies Alzheimers London Marathon team, click here .Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at webcelebs@trinitymirror or call us direct   .

The pregnant duchess chose to wear a red Maison Valentino outfit as the royal couple touched down in Casablanca last night. The red dress holds strong connotations in the north African country. It is the colour of the national flag to start with - but its a lot more than that. For Moroccans the colour red represents hardiness, bravery, strength and valour.   Meghan also wore nude heels and gloves paired with a Valentino clutch bag worth pound,. The royal couple then met with -year-old Crown Prince, Moulay Hassan - dubbed one of the “richest teenagers in the world”. He shook hands with the couple at the entrance to their royal villa in the grounds of King Mohammeds palace.

Meghan was dating Canadian chef Cory Vitiello at the time and Richard says she joked about buying wedding dresses when he said he saw a marriage in her near future. But a few months later, the former Suits actress split from Cory. Richard said the duchess sent him an email telling him about the break-up. It had little hearts all over it so maybe she had met her prince by then, he said. Richard said Meghan was not like other driven, ambitious actresses and instead seemed very down to earth.   He said she talked about food a lot and, instead of going into movies, wanted to one day do a cooking show on The Food Network. He also said she fancied her own make-up line and was in talks for a deal with QVC.He told The Sun on Sunday: I used to hold a bracelet and her phone - she loved me to hold her phone - to read her energy, and we just talked. There was a real rapport.She loved children and told me she wanted lots. She wanted a little girl, one she could dress up because shes a real fashionista.

He was born breech, which is buttocks first, at around .pm. The mum was told that an air ambulance had been called however it would be a while until it arrived. During this time, the mum described the moment before she was sent away as being filled with confusion, questions and lack of decisions. A doctor and two nurses eventually arrived by police car from Inverness to take care of the first twin. As she waited on the air ambulance to take her away, the mum was told that it was unable to land due to frost on the propellers.   Because of this, a decision was made to continue the ambulance trip to Inverness. Two ambulances and three cars left at am the next day.

He was taken to the special care baby unit along with his brother. She added: ‘But we would like to know why weren’t we flown to Inverness  Why could specialists not come up to Wick  Why are Wick and Golspie staff expected to work like that  Golspie wasn’t prepared for such an emergency but they did what they could and they did amazing. This shouldn’t be the case. We dread to think what could have happenedthe road was closed by an accident or bad weather.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also pledged to look into the -mile ambulance journey. Ron Gunn of the Caithness Health Action Team , which is campaigning for better maternity services, described the case as horrendous.He told the Mail Online: Valid questions need answered. The whole thing would have been avoidedthey had airlted her down to Inverness or they had brought up a team to deal with it in Wick.Hopefully lessons can be learned from it. We will probably never get back to where we were but the system we have at the moment is not really safe. A NHS Highland spokesman told ious publications safety of mum and children was the first priority of the health board and that standard assessment, triage and transfer protocols were followed. The spokesman said: For reasons of patient confidentiality, NHS Highland would not wish to comment publicly upon the case in question but as in all such cases we will be conducting an internal review to consider the specic circumstances of this case.

The -year-old, fromNewquay, initially went to her doctor with fatigue and heavy bleeding after an abortion in  aged , but claims she was misdiagnosed as having an abnormal period.  Demi explained: “At first I was misdiagnosed. They said that it was abnormal period and thought it would be sorted with contraception. “After  months, I found out I had CIN  and have been struggling with it since.” CIN  is caused by human papillomavirusand treatment to remove them is usually recommended. Demi was diagnosed aged  and she has not been able to have a smear test since. She said: “I saw a gynaecologist, who immediately booked me in for an operation to remove pre-cancerous cells. “I’ve been going back and forth from the hospital, having procedures. “In the last four years I’ve been on three tablets a day for two years, biopsies nearly every month, three procedures on my cervix where they removed the pre-cancerous and cancerous cells.”  The minimum age to get a cervical screening in the UK is currently , and is justied by the fact that cervical cancer is very rare below that age and that it is common to have abnormalities which usually go away by themselves. Due to the dferent operations that Demi has had over the years, she was told that there was a high chance that she could not have a child. She explained: “For the last two years I have massively struggled due to the fact I was advised I may not be able to conceive and thatthe speed and continuous spreading carried on a hysterectomy would be on the cards. “I am now nearly  weeks pregnant but in those  weeks I’ve had a trip to Treliske every two weeks to check my cervix , midwe appointments nearly every two weeks, consultation appointments and prenatal appointments. “It’s going well but I have to go to the hospital every week. The operations were to remove parts of the cervix and that’s what made it dficult. My cervix is too short. I could have had a premature baby, a miscarriage, etc.”   She said that she wants to share her story to make sure young women or teenagers do not experience what she has gone through. “I’m , still not the legal age for a smear but yet have suffered massively and my family have as well seeing me go through this,” she said. “I need to try and tell my story because more woman need to realise a smear isn’t the scary bit - it’s what can happen after. “The minimum age should be lowered orgirls go to the doctor and ask, they should be offered the test. “Both of my younger sisters have been to the doctor’s as soon as they were  due to all the complications that I’ve had. “You just have to push and push. When you’re a teenager you know your body. If it doesn’t seem right, you have to ask to be tested.” Demi is a tattoo model and she says she uses her photo shoots for magazines to raise awareness as much as she can and do campaigns.  She said: “Smear tests should be offered earlier and it’s about getting more girls to do it. “I raise awareness any way I can. We’ve got to help each other when it comes to smear test and cervical cancer. “Hospital staff is amazing, everyone is so, so good and they are mostly women so they understand what you’re going through. I’ve found that taking my mother and my grandmother helps.” In , ministers rejected calls for the screening age for cervical cancer to be lowered, arguing that doing so would cause  positive results and would lead to people receiving unnecessary – and potentially harmful – treatment. According to the NHS, the symptoms of cervical cancer are unusual vaginal bleeding during or after sex, between your periods or after the menopause, pain during sex, unusual vaginal discharge and pain in the lower back or pelvis. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papillomavirus , and there are effective vaccines that can protect people from contracting HPV. The vaccines, however, cannot treat existing infections.

I cant say whether it is right or wrong, butthe law of the land says that it is correct to cancel her citizenship, then I agree. If she at least admitted she made a mistake then I would feel sorry for her and other people would feel sorry for her. But she does not accept her wrong.

From next week, it will feel much colder with gale-force winds expected to batter Britains coasts and heavy rain likely in many places, especially the west.   Sunday got off to a foggy start in many places, with the Met Office issuing a yellow warning for parts of England and Wales. It will be slow to clear across the north Midlands, Yorkshire and the east of Northern Ireland. Sunday will be dry and largely sunny, and it will feel very mild again in the sunshine, with temperatures hitting the mid to high teens in places. It will feel colder on some coasts, however.  Patchy fog and frost will develop overnight, and northwest Scotland and Northern Ireland will be cloudier with some patchy rain. Monday will almost be a carbon copy of Sunday, with fog patches in the morning followed by another dry and sunny day for many. Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to stay dry, sunny and very mild by day, but nights will be chilly with some fog, the Met Office warned. Thursday will be cooler with patchy rain spreading eastwards.  From then on, there is uncertainty in the forecast, with some models predicting an increased risk of cloud, strong winds and heavy rain, particularly for the west. By next weekend, Atlantic storms will bring spells of wet and windy weather across the country, with the wettest and windiest conditions expected in the west. Snow is possible over higher ground in the north, the Met Office said. Temperatures will be several degrees cooler throughout this period, compared with mid-Februarys mild weather. Februarys mild weather is a marked contrast to the low temperatures and snow brought by the Beast from the East just  months ago.  Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said: These conditions are going to be continuing until Tuesday and then on Wednesday it starts to turn a little bit cooler in the North West, but certainly eastern and southern areas are going to still be quite mild. She said temperatures of up to C could be felt on Monday and Tuesday. London, for example, should be C at this time of year. Inland Wales should be C or C, around the coast of Wales it should be C. Northern England should be around about C to C - C inland, C around the coast. Northern Ireland C or C, Scotland, generally around about C to C, around the coast and inland. So obviously some places seeing temperatures  degrees above the average.  The warmest February day in Scotland was recorded this week when Aboyne in Aberdeenshire hit the maximum temperature of .C on Thursday afternoon. It beats the previous high of .C recorded in Aberdeen on February , . The maximum temperature of that day nearly  years ago was matched at .pm and by .pm the mercury had risen another .C. Kew Gardens in London was the countrys hottest spot on Saturday, hitting .C, the Met Office said. It was the third straight day somewhere in the UK had recorded above C. Met Office five-day weather forecastSundayEarly fog and low cloud clearing during the morning, although more slowly across the north Midlands, Yorkshire and the east of Northern Ireland. Otherwise dry and largely sunny, and feeling very mild again in the sunshine. Colder on some coasts.Sunday nightDry with clear spells for many, allowing some patchy fog and frost to develop. Northwest Scotland and Northern Ireland however will be cloudier with some patchy rain.MondayFog patches clearing leaving another dry and sunny day for many, although the far northwest will be cloudy with some patchy rain. Feeling springlike once again in the sunshine.Tuesday to ThursdayTuesday and Wednesday remaining dry, sunny and very mild by day, but nights will be chilly with some fog forming in places. Cooler on Thursday with patchy rain spreading eastwards.  Wet and windy weather on the way The Met Office has warned of wet and windy weather - and snow - in its long-term outlook for Thursday  February to Saturday  March. It says: There is a great deal of uncertainty through Thursday and Friday. Some signals suggest a breakdown of settled conditions from the Atlantic, which would bring a greater chance of thicker cloud, wind and rain, particularly for the west. The other scenario is for settled conditions to continue until the weekend, extending the spell of drier weather. By the weekend Atlantic weather systems look more likely to bring spells of wet and windy weather across all areas, with the west more prone to the wettest and windiest conditions. Some snow is possible over higher ground in the north. Brighter, drier spells are also likely in between frontal systems so generally turning much more unsettled than recently across the UK. Feeling colder with temperatures closer to average. Mild temperatures toin March Heres the Met Offices outlook for Sunday  March to Sunday  March: The extended outlook is most likely to begin with weather systems bringing spells of cloud, rain and strong winds followed by showers and some drier, sunny interludes. The wettest, windiest weather remains most likely in the northwest, with the best of any drier, brighter weather in the south, extending to central areas at times. Temperatures are expected to fluctuate day-to-day but overall could be slightly above-average. By late March confidence is low, but there remains a possibility of ato slowly-evolving weather patterns across the UK giving some drier, brighter spells.

I was a year into a busy office job when the symptoms started and everything was going well in my le until then. I started noticing blood in my stool occasionally when I was going to the toilet, which was such a small amount and barely noticeable at the time.  But with that came overwhelming, constant exhaustion, accompanied by lower left abdominal pain, which worsened as the days went on. I also suffered with severe mouth ulcers on a daily basis, which were so painful and would last for weeks. Sometimes I couldnt eat because of them, and during this time I lost about two stones in weight over the course of the year. I thought maybe I was anaemic as I felt so tired all the time, but then the toilet trips became more frequent and rushing to the bathroom became a regular occurrence for me.   My diagnosis It’s hard having to explain as a girl in your early twenties that you’re going to the toilet up to  times a day and are experiencing all these embarrassing symptoms, but I felt better once I got it off my chest. After examining me, the doctor was certain I had a type of inflammatory bowel disease, either Crohn’s or colitis. I had never heard of colitis, and knew nothing about it. Reading about them made me even more sure I had some form of the illness. I was booked in at the hospital the week after, where they would look at my intestines with a camera. When the day came, I felt anxious, uncertain and alone. I could see on the screen next to me that my colon was severely ulcerated and sore, not healthy like it should have been. This is what the illness was doing to my body, it was attacking my good cells. As the nurse held my hand through the procedure, I breathed in the gas and air and closed my eyes. I visualised being in a tropical paradise away from the hospital bed, anything to take my attention away from what was happening. The specialists voice brought me back to reality: Yes that’s definitely ulcerative colitis. I was diagnosed on November , . I remember it well because it was the day after my st birthday - what a time to be told you have a lelong, chronic illness! I was given some steroids which I would take eight times a day, along with some other tablets for the inflammation and sent on my way. So there it was, a quick diagnosis from a few blood tests and a camera testbut I was lucky to get diagnosed so soon. I felt a weight lt off my shoulders and a new-found optimism for the future. I assumed the new medication would get my symptoms under control and all would be well again, that I could live a normal le, but little did I know what challenges I would face moving forward.   Le after diagnosis The steroids got my illness under control, and I felt on top of the world for a few months. I wasn’t running to the toilet all the time, the urgency had gone, I had more energy and my appetite came back. Working full-time became easier and I could focus more on what needed doing, as well as feeling happier in myself. The down side was the steroids made me gain a stone-and-a-half in water weight and my face and ankles swelled up like a balloon, which was not a nice thing to see in the mirror. At the same time, though, I was just so thankful to be well again and feeling normal that I didn’t let it get me down. When I began weaning off the steroids, the dreaded blood ed, shortly followed by the fatigue, abdominal pain and toilet trips. I couldn’t exercise like I used to, I had to stop running and attending zumba classes, which I always loved. It all became too much for my body and the colitis was continuously fighting against me. Whenever I used to do too much my body had a way of telling me, by giving me mouth ulcers or pain in my joints. My lowest experience of this was when I had to use crutches for weeks as my right ankle decided to swell up, and I couldn’t put any weight on it at all. At first I thought I had fractured something, but the doctors told me it was erythema nodosum, a type of swelling which occurs around the joint due to an inflammatory illness. I remained in this state of being unwell for the next three years, back and forward to the doctor for check-ups and on the same tablets called Asacol, on and off steroids every few weeks. I began to miss a lot of work as things got worse, but I was lucky to have supportive and caring colleagues along the way. I assumed that feeling ill was part of my le now, and that I had to live with it. I struggled on and put on a brave face. I remember driving to work and having to pull over because I was sick from feeling so hungry — each time I ate my body rejected it. I learned to deal with having to go to the bathroom up to  times a day while I was at work, I learnt to smile behind the pain, hoping no one would notice the extent of what I was feeling. I learnt to get up and show up even when all I felt like doing was staying in bed. I would sit on the toilet first thing in the morning and do my make-up with my mirror on my lap, ready to fight this thing no matter what. I was determined not to let it control my le. Even in the darkest times, I carried on.  Three years later Following the ups and downs since my diagnosis, I was well over the Christmas period of , enjoying it with my family and resting as much as I could. I was determined I would be well enough to go back to work in January, without getting poorly. The first day back at work arrived, I felt ready for January : new year, new me, I thought. But later that day it came back with a vengeance. I just couldn’t do it anymore, I was thrown into another flare and this time I couldn’t hide behind it. I had a blood test done the same day and the doctor rang me at home, expressing concerns about my results. The red blood cell count was very low which meant I was anaemic and I was at risk of having a stroke at any time. I didnt realise how bad it was, I thought feeling this unwell was normal. The week leading up to me going into hospital I was experiencing excruciating migraines every night which kept me awake for hours. My hands and tongue felt numb from the pain and I had blurred vision, as well as having to go to to the toilet throughout the night. I didnt want to admit defeat, but I gave in this time. Hospital Most of my two-week hospital stay is a memory of nightly migraines, scans, blood tests, a plethora of painkillers and sleep. They explained the migraines were as a result of the lack of red blood cells in my system, and therefore I would need an iron infusion or possibly a blood transfusion. I was also told that I may have to have surgery to remove part of my damaged bowel, but I narrowly escaped this as they decided to put me on azathioprine, a new biological drug that was available for colitis patients. I was relieved I didn’t have to have surgery, and although I didn’t have much appetite while I was there, I decided to force myself to eat more to get my strength up. I wanted to go home and I definitely didn’t want surgery! I know some people don’t have a choice, but I had another option. I remember my sister visited from Cardf and surprised me with my favourite jam and cream cake, which we both used to buy when we were teenagers at school. She also brought a teddy bear and nail nishes — I chose a wine red to make me feel pretty again. That day was my favourite day in hospital. When I left the hospital I was weak and frail, weighing only seven stones, and I felt low about how much weight I had lost. My hair had also thinned from all the medication and it was falling out every time I showered. No longer did I have my lovely long locks that I had always treasured. I remember people staring at me in the wheelchair at the supermarket, but I didn’t care because I was going home. Mum helped me wash and dress as I didn’t have the strength. I was so grateful to her and still am to this day for being my rock at that time. A couple of days after getting home, the nurse rang me from the hospital and said I would need to have a blood transfusion as I had lost so much blood over two weeks. I was given a pint-and-a-half of blood, which finally put an end to my relentless headaches . The first night that I slept all night without a headache was the nicest feeling in the world. Recovery My recovery process came from  months of being on steroids again, along with the new drug I was given to seeit would get me into remission. I wasn’t well enough to work, so I left my job, which was a dficult choice. In the time I recovered I slept a lot, read numerous books, had visits from friends — the rest of  was all a bit of a blur. I took a whole year off work to get myself back on track, as I needed the time to rest and heal. The picture below shows me in the months where I was trying to put the weight back on and regain my strength, but my hair remained thin and dull. I lost a lot of confidence in that year, because in a way the colitis had taken away so many important things in my le: my self-esteem, my physical activity, friends, relationships, my job, my ability to just go out whenever I felt like it. Everything had to be thought through and calculated: were there going to be toilets nearby  And you don’t want to tell people every day how you feel because its an ongoing thing. Its lelong, it’s not just a virus that has antibiotics and then it goes away. Public Perceptions Ulcerative colitis is classed as a hidden disability, and people think you are completely fine just by looking at you. It is quite frustrating sometimes when people assume just because you look fit and able, that you are in better health than someone who uses a wheelchair. That’s not always the case. I understand some people don’t know you have an illness because it’s not visible, but that doesn’t give them to right to judge based on the way you look. I might look fine but sometimes still go home and go straight to bed at the end of the day because I’m exhausted from the fatigue my illness causes me. I think a lot more needs to be done to raise awareness of iniduals with hidden disabilities like mine, and to emphasise the importance of the saying ‘Dont judge a book by its cover’. What I didn’t realise when I got diagnosed was that I would not only struggle so much physically, but mentally too. Since I began my colitis journey, I have suffered with depression and anxiety, dealing with panic attacks and social anxiety. All though this has been dficult and I still get these feelings from time to time, I have learnt to change my mindset and my way of thinking, most importantly by living a positive and healthy le, surrounding myself with those people who love me. My le now I have now been on a biological drug called Infliximab since May , which has been a true miracle. I am on infusions of this every two months, alongside Azathioprine, which I responded positively to and can honestly say it has given me my le back. It slows down the immune response somehow, and is also known to treat cancer. I hope it continues to keep me well for years to come. Since getting my illness under control, I am able to exercise again, go running and to weekly zumba classes, and I was able to get back to working a part-time job. These things give me security and purpose in le, as well as meeting new people and feeling stronger mentally. Although gaining back my confidence and self-esteem is an ongoing process, I am now in control of the illness and take care of my body through healthy eating and daily meditation techniques. My sister is currently suffering with the same symptoms that I had, and we think she may also have colitis, but are still awaiting test results to come back. During these dficult times I feel we are going through this journey together, and whenever she needs me on the bad days I will be here to give her strength. I know what she is going through and I know how she feels having been there myself, so as best friends and sisters it’s nice to know we have each other to turn to. We have also created our own Instagram page together called @PrettyLittlePurslows, which keeps my mind focused on new projects and exciting goals for the future ahead. I think it’s important for all people who are dealing with a chronic le-changing illness to never give up or lose hope, as I promise there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Whether you have been newly diagnosed or are still yet to find relief, please take care of your body and listen to it when it is tired. I am only speaking from my own experience of living with the disease, and I am no expert, but I believe we are faced with these challenges in le because we are strong enough to come through the other side, and I know I have. We are all born warriors - we can rise again!

At  stone, three pounds, he is more than twice the average weight for his age after scoffing mountains of junk food. Now his mum is begging doctors to give him a pound, NHS gastric bypass. That is because Donna — who herself once weighed  stone — had the same operation last year. The -year-old ambulance worker said the procedure helped her to shed st and she now weighs less than her son. “People might criticise me for wanting to put my child through major surgery but I know from my own experience that it will change his le,” she said. During the procedure, the top part of the stomach is joined to the small intestine, so you feel fuller soon and you don’t absorb as many calories through food.   Ben, who is ft in tall, is bullied over his weight and lacks the willpower to diet. He said: “The bullying makes me feel bad. I want a gastric bypass like my mum. “Even though it would take a while to recover, I think it would be worth it and I could go on my bike with my friends.” Donna, from Havant, Hants, said: “I’ve broken down in tears in the doctor’s surgery because he really needs help. “A gastric bypass is major surgery but will be worth it. “Willpower is a big problem with Ben. He’s asked for slimming shakes but they’ll leave him hungry and he’ll give up. “If I could turn back time, I wouldn’t have let him eat so much junk. “I always apologise to him for letting him become the way he is as I blame myself.   “I’ve tried to push him into rugby and football but he would rather come home and play the Xbox.” Ben ate normally until he was four when Donna split with his dad and he started to have tantrumsshe didn’t ply him with chips, pasta and biscuits. “He would lob the plate across the roomhe didn’t like what was on there,” she said. “He was a chicken nugget machine. I would only give him about four at first. As he got older, his appetite would increase and he was always saying he was hungry. “I tried giving him smaller portions but half an hour later, he’d be raiding the cupboards for biscuits. I do wish I hadn’t given in now.”   She added: “I’ve been told I need to cut things down and be strict with him but he has behavioural issues and I need a house left standing. “I can’t constantly be decorating because he is lobbing a plate across the room. “He has all the signs of ADHD including poor concentration but he’s never been diagnosed. “I’m always being told it’s a parenting issue. I ask myselfI’m a bad parent. But I always come down on him like a ton of bricks over right and wrong.” Bullies teased Ben when they saw his mum at the school gates. Donna explained: “Ben was coming home upset as he was being taunted. People would say, ‘You are getting as fat as your mum’.   “It would destroy me. Some nights, I’d sit here in tears but I would use food as a comfort and he picked up on it. She could munch her way through  bags of crisps after a huge helping of pasta and chips. “I would watch telly nibbling crisps to try to make myself feel happier and he’d say, ‘You do it mum, why can’t I ’” Donna was  stone by the time she was  — and being bullied made her eat more. She said: “I was always called ‘fat cow’ walking down the road, and told boys would never have me because I’m fat. “I was terrible for eating in secret. I’d stuff my face silly at mates’ houses so my mum wouldn’t know.” At , when she fell pregnant with Ben, she was so heavy her st scales couldn’t hold her weight. Donna tried the Atkins Diet, which saw her shed st, but doctors warned it was affecting her kidneys.   She said: “I starved myself for a week once because I was so sick of Ben being bullied but I had no energy and I was no good for him. Stuck at st, she asked seven doctors to refer her for a gastric bypass before she was finally accepted last April. The op has left her feeling “ecstatic”. “I woke up from the operation and, for the first time ever, I had no interest in food,” she said. “The weight started falling off. People I’ve known for years don’t recognise me in the street. “Now, I’m stuffedI eat a Weetabix so I know it would be a godsend for Ben. I’ve been asking doctors to give him the operation for two years. “I don’t want him getting diabetes, or heart disease. But most of all I just don’t want him to have the miserable le I had for years.” Ben wants to join the police or the army when he leaves school and Donna believes the op would encourage him to be more active. She said: “He can’t join the police or the armyhe can’t run. “If I can get him down weight wise, he will enjoy sport more and won’t have kids taking the mickey and running round the pitch like a lump of lard. “I still give him treats, like a bag of popcorn on a Friday night, but I ration them.”   On a typical day, Ben’s breakfast is Weetabix, toast and scrambled eggs. Lunch is a ham sandwich and dinner spaghetti bolognese or pasta bake with chips. He no longer snacks through ten biscuits, a bowl of ice cream and a big bag of microwave popcorn each day. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the NHS gave children weight loss surgery onlytheir conditions were le threatening. “The child’s mum has done very well to lose this weight but it is not a good idea for the child to have bariatric surgery,” he said. “A child is still growing andyou have a gastric bypass you are severely limiting the food which that child needs in order to grow. “People might say it’s better to be thin and small but the body should be allowed to grow to its full, natural size. “The mother should hang off for a few years, all the time doing her utmost to keep him off the junk food he has been eating. “He will also need psychiatric counselling because the child has eaten too much fast food all of his le and will have a yearning to continue after a gastric bypass. “That will be ruinous because it might upset the bypass. He is not of an age to appreciate how crucial it is that he should amend his lestyle. “It’s less likely he’ll have the mental capacity to moderate his eating practices.”   Kids getting fat busting surgery at  Obese children as young as  are undergoing weight-loss surgery on the NHS. Latest stats from NHS Digital show  overweight youngsters under the age of  were operated on at hospitals in England in the three years to April .

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: “There are children who are so fat that when they go to bed they roll over and lie on their airways and suffocate. “It is obese kids with le-threatening conditions like this who are having bariatric surgery. “Normally children of that age will not be given bariatric surgery because they are still growing.

No\u2028-one knew how Kim intended to make the journey to Hanoi for his\u2028 second peace summit with the US president - on Wednesday and Thursday - until the\u2028 train rumbled over the border bridge into China. Along the way, it would have passed small villages where Kims people are living in poverty and squalor.  Photos released by North Korean state media show Kim standing in a carriage door and waving shortly before the train left the capital Pyongyang. Hes opted to travel about  hours by rail instead of taking a four-hour flight. The train - which has  carriages equipped with all-white conference rooms, dining cars and sleeping quarters - was later pictured at a station in the border city of Dandong, China. Some carriages are decorated with pink leather chairs,\u2028 big-screen TVs and ivory-coloured curtains in\u2028 the windows.  The train also has satellite phone connections so Kim can\u2028 keep abreast of developments and issue orders, according to\u2028state television. One carriage contains his bulletproof Mercedes-Benz car. Ahn Byung-min, a\u2028 senior analyst at South Koreas government-funded Korea\u2028 Transport Institute, told Reuters: His private train for sure has a luxurious interior and\u2028 good-quality facilities, but it also can travel safely in China,\u2028 with pretty good rail tracks there. If Kim makes the entire journey by rail, the train will travel a vast distance across China before arriving in Hanoi after about two-and-a-half days.  It is possible Kim and his large security detail could stop on the way, possibly in Beijing, and complete the rest of the journey by air. The train can travel at mph on Chinas rail network, compared with a maximum of about mph on North Koreas system, said Ahn. Last year, Kim and his we Ri Sol-ju used the train to make an unofficial visit to Beijing, where they were pictured on board with other officials and waving from an open window. Kim is using the train to make peace with Trump, but he has used the train to prepare for war in the past.  In , state media showed him arriving back in Pyongyang \u2028to a red-carpet celebration \u2028from a satellite launching station in Sohae, after the\u2028 successful testing of a long-range rocket that the US said was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim has since pledged to dismantle missile engine-testing and launch facilities at the Sohae site. Trains have become part of the Kim family lore - and accounts from former passengers and South Korean news reports have revealed some of their secrets. Its carriages have been customised to include conference rooms, bedrooms, a dining car, an office car and reception facilities, and are kitted out with flat-screen televisions, computers and satellite phones.  According to South Korean media, the leader has about  fortied carriages at its disposal. Three trains were used when Kims father made long-distance journeys. He travelled in the middle train, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported in . The first train carried about  security personnel who searched stations further ahead for bombs and tested track safety to make sure the rails werent sabotaged. The train following behind the late leaders carriage carried more bodyguards and supplies.  The travelling entourage would be accompanied on trips within North Korea by military helicopters and planes to look for potential threats. It was claimed the elder Kim - who died on a train in  - would throw lavish parties complete with bouts of heavy drinking, expensive food, karaoke and musical performances on his journeys. Konstantin Pulikovsky, a Russian official who travelled with Kim Jong-il through Russia for three weeks in , once told how guests on board the train could order dishes of Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and French cuisine, the New York Times reported. He said the leader had live lobster and other fresh delicacies delivered to the train as it crossed Siberia, and cases of Bordeaux and Burgundy wines were flown in from Paris, said Pulikovsky, wrote about the experience in his memoir of the trip.  Barbecued pork was said to be among the dishes served to passengers. Kim Jong-il would be entertained by female entertainers, known as lady conductors, who sang in Korean and Russian when he was bored. Some  stations had been built specically for Kim Jong-ils own use in North Korea before he was said to have died of a heart attack on board his train in December . A replica of one of the carriages is displayed at the grand mausoleum where Kim Jong-il and his father and North Koreas founder Kim Il-sung, who also travelled by train, rest in state. There were claims an explosion involving trains near the Chinese border in  was part of a failed assassination plot on the elder Kim, who had passed by hours earlier.There have been just fleeting glimpses of the trains interior in North Korean state media reports.Kim Jong-il, who hated flying and led a playboy lestyle, was once seen in a dining car surrounded by food as he was served by staff and entertained by well-dressed performers.He was said to have made more than a dozen foreign trips to China and Russia. South Korean and American intelligence services have been spying on the train for years, using satellites, reconnaissance aircraft and other surveillance equipment, it was reported.North Koreas founding leader, Kim Il-sung, the current leaders\u2028 grandfather, travelled abroad by train regularly during his rule\u2028 until his death in . His train journeys included a trip to Vietnam in  when\u2028 he transferred in Beijing to a plane, and travel to Eastern\u2028Europe in  via the Soviet Union.

Ice calving is where an iceberg breaks away from the edge of a larger body of ice is is a natural process that regularly happens. Another recent example was the  calving of a Delaware-sized iceberg from the Larsen C ice shelf that broke away from the Antarctic Peninsula.   But the calving at Antarctica’s Brunt Ice Shelf is unusual as NASA say that the region was originally thought of as stable. However the crack has been growing at a rate of around . miles per year. Pictures from NASAs Operational Land Imager show how the crack has grown eastwards from an area dubbed the McDonald Ice Rumples. In a statement, the space agency said: It is not yet clear how the remaining ice shelf will respond following the break, posing an uncertain future for scientic infrastructure and a human presence on the shelf that was first established in .  “The rumples are due to the way ice flows over an underwater formation, where the bedrock rises high enough to reach into the underside of the ice shelf. “This rocky formation impedes the flow of ice and causes pressure waves, crevasses, and rts to form at the surface.” The latest crack has led to concerns about the Halley Research Station, which is run by the British Antarctic Survey. Usually the base runs year-round, but the “unpredictable changes” to the ice has meant it has had to shut down twice over the last few years.   Chris Shuman, a glaciologist with NASA, said in a statement: “The likely future loss of the ice on the other side of the Halloween Crack suggests that more instability is possible, with associated risk to Halley VI.”A spokesperson from the BAS told Newsweek that the safety of its staff is the top priority and they are constantly monitoring the movement of the ice.She said: Our most recenthigh-resolution synthetic aperture radar image showed that the rate of widening of the crack does appear to have increased since mid-January, but not enough to cause alarm, she said. The station is designed to be relocatable. In  BAS successfully relocated the station’s eight modules kmupstream of a previously dormant ice chasm. The frequency of relocation depends very much on how the ice behaves in the future. Our long-term ice monitoring project is designed to alert us of any signicant change in the ice.

To add to the drama, it’s done as a race against the clock.And McIntyre is gaining a growing reputation for doing the same with top-flight clubs here.Four-and-a-bit years ago he arrived at Ross County with the Highland outfit seemingly already doomed to relegation.By the end of that season he hadn’t just kept the Staggies up, he’d rebuilt them into a squad that would go on and win silverware in the shape of the  League Cup.After the Dark Blues’ weekend win at Livingston got them out of the bottom two for the first time since the end of August, thanks to goals from new handy men Andrew Nelson and Scott Wright, there are strong signs he can do the same at Dens Park.McIntyre’s reign as Dundee boss started in October when he received an SOS from owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms.After a miserable start to the campaign, the Americans’ dream of cementing their team as a force in the Premiership and, eventually, taking the club to a new stadium looked in danger of crumbling around them.Confirmation of just how dire the need for an emergency rebuild came in his first game in charge when the roof fell in during a - defeat at Livi. It showed how flimsy the foundations of the team were as they collapsed under the weight of the home team’s excellence at set-pieces.Almost exactly four months on and after that second visit to the Tony Macaroni Arena under the new boss, the structure looks much more sound.And it’s all thanks to the kind of speedy reconstruction he undertook at County and of which Knowles and his team would be proud. For the team that ran out against Livi at the weekend bore no resemblance to the one McIntyre had to work with when he first headed there.Not one of the players in the starting XI in October were on from the start this time and of the  who were involved on that first day,  have left the club.Only Kenny Miller, Cammy Kerr and Elliott Parish remain and, of those three, veteran Miller was the sole participant in the vital - victory.For McIntyre, to bring about almost a complete change in such a short space of time has been a gamble, one that will only be confirmed as paying offhis team are still in the Premiership come the end of the season.It’s one, though, that represents his best chance of success and it is very much a case of so far so good.While Dundee under him remain a work in progress, the signs of improvement have been there for all to see.Since the end of the winter break there have been two wins, two draws and just one defeat in five league outings.By some margin that’s been the best run of form in the top flight so far this term.If it continues there is every reason to believe that target of building a team good enough for this level by the end of the season will have been achieved.Andthat is the case, fans will be hoping given more time, the manager will be able to set about putting together something even more impressive for next season and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potholes-20000-craters-rack-up-more-than-1m-in-repairs-in-2018","story":"MORE than pound, was paid out to Glasgow drivers for damage caused by potholes last year, new figures show."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-from-bedroom-dj-to-double-brit-winner","story":"CALVIN Harris has undergone quite the transformation, from being a budding DJ recording in his bedroom to becoming a double Brit-winning musician who models on the side."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-and-snp-clash-over-equal-pay-at-council-budget","story":"A ROW over the decade long equal pay dispute broke out at the City Chambers as the SNP got its budget through"},{"url":null,"title":"steve-clarke-im-not-a-fenian-im-a-catholic-from-the-west-of-scotland","story":"STEVE Clarke today admitted that he couldnrsquot believe being brought up as Catholic was still an issue within Scottish football and society in general."},{"url":null,"title":"new-13m-plan-to-fix-more-glasgow-potholes-first-time","story":"MORE potholes will be fixed first time under a new repairs investment plan by Glasgow City Council."},{"url":null,"title":"james-mcfadden-scotlands-hopes-on-our-wide-men-as-we-start-euro-campaign","story":"HE was known as a wide man himself once.

could be a more effective deterrent to Invernessrsquos seagull menace than culling, according to the RSPB.The suggestion comes in response to a call for a limited cull by city businessman Charlie Barbour.Mr Barbour, who owns city centre bars The White House and The Dog House as well as commercial property agency Barbour Commercial, suggests that destroying a small number of nesting pairs would make the centre of Inverness more attractive, safer and quieter.Describing the birds as ldquonoisy, dirty, aggressive and a blight on the city centre, Mr Barbour questions whether the Inverness Business Improvement Districtpolicy of removing eggs each year is enough to permanently reduce the gull population.ldquoWhilst a cull of such birds is not a universally popular decision, I just wonderthere is merit in destroying say three or four nesting pairs of seagulls each year, he writes.ldquoA reduction in seagull numbers would improve the city centre experience for visitors and that surely has to be a good thing However, a spokeswoman for conservation charity the RSPB said that lethal control should only ever be a last resort, used only where there is a proven problem and other alternatives have proven ineffective. Instead, local authorities, businesses and iniduals should tackle the problem by reducing the birdsrsquo food supply by cutting down the amount of edible litter and introducing gull-proof litter bins.Other non-lethal options include putting up physical barriers such as netting on roofs as a deterrent before the breeding season.ldquoWe believe that gull problems in an urban environment are best tackled by reducing the availability of food and nest sites. If the features that attract gulls remain, any `vacanciesrsquo created by controlling existing gulls will simply be filled by other gulls moving in, she said.Sunday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119686.jpg","title":"Roads not safe for city cyclists says Inverness campaigner","story":"A LOT needs to be done to bring roads in Inverness up to a standard that makes them safe and easy for road users to navigate, a leading cycling campaigner has said.Brian MacKenzie, convener of the Highland Cycle Campaign, said: ldquoI cycle a lot and there is no doubt the roads in the town are in very poor condition.ldquoThe trunk roads, too, need attention.Championing the cause for better and safer routes for cyclists he said drivers also need to be aware of cyclists and give greater consideration to them.ldquoDrivers often criticise cyclists when they see them weaving along certain routes but often they are doing that simply to avoid potholes and are taking evasive action, he said.ldquoAt the Raigmore Interchange, on the ramp joining the A south from the A, there is a pothole which has been there for some time.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

Our hearts are bidden to imitate the snow-drops: to come up from the darkness, raise themselves into the sunlight, and then fill the world with gladness.Parishioners from Ardrishaig, Christ Church, Lochgilphead and Glassary are joining together this Lent to read a poem a day through the  days of Lent and then Easter week.

One poem is set for each day, accompanied by a short explanation, a reflection, and a brief suggestion for our own thinking.Parishoners will be reading the poems at home for those who wish it there will be meetings to share thoughts and inspiration at Ardrishaig Church during the weeks of Lent and at Christ Church on Sundays. Other meetings could be arranged, formally or informally.You can order the book from Fr Simon Mackenzie by emailing dr.lachlan@zen or calling  , or directly from Argyll Book Centre.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

last year.Her findings have been passed to Scottish Minister but are not being made public at this stage.The Scottish Government said: ldquoAn independent planning reporter was appointed to consider

We are considering possible correspondence with the Scottish Government on this matter. The leader of the council has also indicated that he will be writing to express similar concern to the minister.Mr Gray said the decision on the future of the site should never have been taken away from the council in the first place. He said: ldquoIt is of such great importance to the communities affected and the whole of East Lothian that it should have been determined by East Lothian Council and local people.ldquoThe community needs to know what is happening and what the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision will be, which is why I have tabled a question in Parliament asking Ministers to provide an urgent update.Conservative councillor Mr Bruce said: ldquoThe Scottish Government denied the local authorityrsquos right to make a decision on this application in the first place, making the whole process unfair and open to proper local scrutiny.ldquoThe fact that the report still hasnrsquot been released continues to shroud this whole saga in mystery and will leave many local people wondering what the Scottish Government is doing behind closed doors.And MsBallantyne added:ldquoItrsquos incumbent on the Scottish Government to be open and transparent over their decision-making process.ldquoDuring the formation of the report, the public engaged heavily by taking part in public hearings and contributing towards the report. Local stakeholders deserve to know the outcome of the report and, quite frankly, it beggars belief that the Scottish Government have chosen to keep this secret."},{"url":null,"title":"events-held-in-memory-of-much-missed-footballer-craig-fairgrieve","story":"Craig Fairgrieve was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemiain  and passed away in July last year.Now, two fundraising events are taking place to raise funds for Ward  at Edinburghrsquos Western General Hospital.The first fundraiser takes place at Dalkeith Miners Club, with a second event at Cockenzie and Port Seton Royal British Legion just over a fortnight later.Craigrsquos sister Lynsay is among those planning the event in Dalkeith on February .She said: ldquoCraig was a friend to everybody.ldquoHe was very laid back ndashhe was more laid back he would be horizontal.ldquoIf somebody tooted at him in the street he would wave and he liked a bit of banter.ldquoHe was notorious for lines out of films and he was a cheeky chappy and a guy with a smile on his face.Craig, of Prestonpans, played football for Tranent Juniors under-s after growing up in Macmerry and going to Ross High School in Tranent.He began to feel unwell towards the end of .His we Amy said: ldquoIt all started with tiredness.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

There is limited space for such activities within the building which can be accommodated where, enabling access to a wider range of activities and resources.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  Gateway to Scotland  The best Charles Rennie Mackintosh within 90 minutes","story":"The striking beauty and modernity of the work was not fully appreciated in his letime, though the vision of its ambitious creator is now recognised and celebrated around the world.

He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-reviews-locarno-in-glasgow","story":"WErsquoVE decided to have one farinaceous main course at Locarno to keep down the total cost because the other mains are so expensive: pound. to pound..

Even the number of priests who have resigned the ministry, or those who have requested dispensation for clerical celibacy, those numbers are not forthcoming from the Vatican.\"That would help with the conversation about whether celibacy is working for the majority of Catholic priests. Clearly we know it isnrsquot.\"Now that we have the gay debacle as well ndash there are a number of gay priests in the priesthood, and that needs to be acknowledged instead of covered up.\"All of this is about keeping the lid on Pandorarsquos box because once you allow priests to marry, then we get into the situation of priestsrsquo marriages breaking down, wanting orce, wanting to remarry. How can you keep the lid on that reality which the church doesnrsquot accept or condone  That is why this control of the celibacy rule for priests is key.\"Mr Walker explained that another reason why many priests may want to keep the fact they have children a secret is because many are ill-equipped to deal with secular le.He said: \"When I left the ministry I had something like pound in my bank account. You are in a situation where you are frozen by fear [at the thought of] leaving to start a new le in the secular world.\"Priests are worried about security. Nine times out of  they wonrsquot have any money behind them unless theyrsquove been left a legacy from their parents, or perhaps parishioners. If they donrsquot have finances behind them then they will be reliant on the diocese renting them a property and perhaps giving them a stipend each month, which wonrsquot be a great deal.\"Depending on their age they have to think about employment, what do they do for a job  How do they earn their keep \"It also means that they lose their status,there is still a status, for being a Roman Catholic priest. That all goes overnight as well and then they have to face up to their responsibilities which they have never really had to experience before.\"They have been completely sheltered in this cocoon - living in the presbytery, having their bills paid for, people treating them with deference. They would risk losing credibility amongst their own colleagues and companions too.\"Therersquos a lot going on there.\"At the end of the day, they still have fathered children and they should be the number one priority. The church should make it the number one priority for the priest also.\"A brief history of celibacy in the Catholic ChurchCatholic priests were not always required to be celibate, with several of the Apostles known to be married according to biblical accounts.The very first Pope, Saint Peter, was married and there are ious accounts of priests and popes throughout the ages discussing the issue of celibacy in letters and correspondence.Clement of Alexandria, a prominent theologian who died in AD, wrote: \"The church fully receives the husband of one we whether he be priest or deacon or layman, supposing always that he uses his marriage blamelessly, and such a one shall be saved in the begetting of children.By AD, the first written requirement was made for those looking to join the priesthood to be celibate, and in  AD, Pope Gregory VII ruled that married priests were not allowed to say mass or carry out s.In , an ecumenical council for the Catholic church made celibacy mandatory for western clergy.In , Pope Francis said he would consider the possibility of allowing married men to join the priesthood, which is set to be discussed further this year."},{"url":null,"title":"spring-comes-early-at-scotlands-most-exotic-garden","story":"Warmed by the Gulf Stream and protected from winterrsquos blast, the exotic plants of Logan Botanic Garden have always defied the harshest Scottish weather to blossom and flourish against the odds.Just  miles south of Stranraer, itrsquos where the tree fernsrsquo dainty fronds dance in the breeze, giant rhubarb leaves bigger than beach umbrellas create a tunnel to walk through and palm trees that could have come straight from a Calornian bouled thrive all year round.They can cope with the sprinkling of morning frost thatrsquos left some plants sparkling under the winter sun, says Loganrsquos curator Richard Baines. Instead, weeks of mild winter weather have taken a toll, creating confusion that has seen some plants burst into le and blossom weeks earlier than normal.ldquoLots of flowers, including some of the gardenrsquos camellia, are in full flower already, he says. ldquoThatrsquos a lot earlier than normal.One iety in particular, Mary Christian, with rich, glossy, dark green foliage and flowers of dazzling bright pink petals that hug a bouquet of delicate yellow stamen, has erupted in colour several weeks earlier than normal.ldquoItrsquos in full flower at the moment and normally that wouldnrsquot happen [for a few weeks yet], adds Baines.An early spring seemed on the cards as far back as mid-December when he spotted the first snowdrops carpeting the gardenrsquos woodland area ndash nearly two weeks earlier than expected.Throughout winter, the temperature at Logan hasnrsquot dipped below -.#c. Apart from a couple of stormy days which claimed a handful of victims, therersquos been little to send Loganrsquos exotic residents into a terribly deep sleep.ldquoI walked the garden over Christmas and counted  dferent plants in flower, Baines says. ldquoThey are definitely ahead of where they should be.ldquoOne member of staff has been here for over  years and remembers lsquoproperrsquo winters, when the whole place used to be cold and covered in frost.ldquoBut now we can grow plants which are fairly tender and can take just a little frost and they are doing fine outside.For gardeners across Scotland keeping watch for the first tentative green sprout of a crocus or bluebell, this subtle sht is not great news.A mild winter and early spring play havoc with the natural cycle of garden insects. Ladybirds may emerge from hibernation early and ready to feast on aphids only to find the cupboard bare, while a sudden cold snap could be disastrous for fragile flora.ldquoThere can be opportunity, adds Baines. ldquoMilder winters mean we can grow a wider range of plants. But the opposite is that in the last two decades you have probably had more pests and disease entering the world of horticulture than in the last two centuries.ldquoSudden oak death is pretty prominent, and one or two pests are much more prevalent because of the mild conditions.Itrsquos a clear sign ndashany were needed ndash of the battle faced by the natural world, one element of which was highlighted earlier this month when scientists warned that a global scientic review of insects had indicated they could become extinct within a century.The study, by University of Sydney, found % of all insect species are in decline. Their loss, it warned, would spark a ldquocatastrophic collapse in the worldrsquos ecosystems.ldquoQuite often therersquos a lot of mention of birds, animals and insects, but no mention of plants, he says, pointing out the risk to plantstherersquos no insects to pollinate. ldquoItrsquos always the cuddly, furry things that get the mention, but therersquos a whole ecosystem out there. When one part of the ecosystem falls down, therersquos a knock-on effect.But eveneverything in the global garden isnrsquot terribly rosy, therersquos much at Logan ndash one of four botanical gardens across Scotland that come under the umbrella of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh ndash that is, at least, blooming.Last year, more than , visitors made the journey to the Rhins of Galloway on Scotlandrsquos southwestern tip ndash closer, as the crow flies, to the Isle of Man than it is to Glasgow, and further south than Newcastle.There they breathed in the scent from more than  species of New Zealand and Australian eucalyptus at the gardenrsquos Tasmanian Creek, marvelled at -year-old tree ferns that tower four metres tall, and the curious ldquofilo pastry tree, Polylepis australis, which sheds layers of its bark in a bid to capture warm air and protect itself from the cool breezes of its native Andes mountains.In spring and summer, the mountain rhododendrons compete for attention with exotic blooms from the Canary Islands, Australia, South Africa and Chile the  species of palms ndash some over  years old ndash evoke beach le in sunny climes rather than the southwestern tip of Scotland.There are more than  species of wild flora ndash foxgloves, irises and wild grasses ndash carpeting the ground, lilies thrive on the walled gardenrsquos pond and the carbon-neutral Victorian-style greenhouse contains South American gems rarely seen in the UK.Where  could you find a driveway stretching a quarter-of-a-mile thatrsquos lined with  cabbage plants ldquoPeople are blown away by the exoticness of the place, itrsquos like an island with sea on both sides, says Baines, who was so enchanted by Logan as a child that he went on to study horticulture and follow in the footsteps of famous plant explorers like George Forrest, trekking to foreign lands in search of rare specimens.Later this year, Logan will be the focus for a series of celebrations to mark  years since it was handed to the nation.Its roots stretch much further ndash the McDouall family was granted lands in the area by John Balliol in the late th century and built a castle. Destroyed in the th century, a small stump remains within Loganrsquos walled garden.Fascination with exotic plants erupted in the th century, fuelled by explorers who ventured around the world in search of unusual species. The McDouall familyrsquos fascination with what it found and its estatersquos mild climate were a perfect match.Soon the first eucalyptus trees in Scotland were planted in the grounds, and peat bogs dug into terraces to nurture primulas.The estate was gted to the nation in November  and passed to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Now, as well as being the arearsquos prime tourist attraction, itrsquos a base for horticultural study and conservation.New plants are arriving all the time. Later this year, Baines is heading on a plant expedition to Vietnam, in search of new species and to help secure the future of others.ldquoPlants are disappearing very quickly there through the impact of man, he explains.ldquoMany of these plants are very small and very fragile. A good example is a rhododendron called Kanehirae from north Vietnam.\"We did a survey five years ago and found the plant at Logan was the only one left in world.\"We propagated it, and circulated it around other botanic gardens.ldquoItrsquos not possible to undo whatrsquos been done to its native habitat, he adds. ldquoBut we can use our expertise so itrsquos not the end."},{"url":null,"title":"catholic-church-faces-mounting-pressure-to-help-traumatised-scots-children-of-priests","story":"One organisation which is supporting Scots whose fathers are clerics says people are left scared and traumatised by their secretive upbringings, and feel as though the church is trying to pretend they donrsquot exist.Some have even had to sign confidentiality agreements to hide their paternal identities, according to Coping International, which advocates for children of priests.Children have also been sent to Scotland from Ireland and England as a way of keeping them hidden from parish communities which may find out about their parentage.The impact on those involved is severe and detrimental, according to campaigners, who describe their treatment and lack of acknowledgement as ldquoclerical abuse.The Catholic church in Scotland has admitted it has no idea how many Scottish priests, or those working in Scotland, have fathered children.A spokesman has also compared the situation to office workers having extramarital affairs, and said the church as an employer wouldnrsquot necessarily have to get involved.It comes after secret Vatican guidelines emerged this week for priests who father children, but the church has refused to release the documents or explain what advice they contained.Vincent Doyle, founder of support organisation Coping International, has blasted Scottish bishops for failing to get to grips with the scale of the issue, and said more needs to be done to support women and prieststhey find they are expecting a baby.Irish psychotherapist Doyle set up Coping International after he found out a priest he believed was his godfather was actually his biological dad. He said he is currently supporting several Scots between  and  whose fathers are priests, who, he said, have been left scarred by their covert parentage and are afraid to speak out.However, he stressed that the actual number of children, men and women across the globe whose fathers are Scottish priests, or who live in Scotland, is likely to be much higher.Sonflowers, a support group for women who have had relationships with priests, previously reported that it had been inundated with calls from Scottish women claiming they were having relationships with priests and in some cases were pregnant by them.The organisationrsquos founder said in  she had hoped to set up a specically Scottish group to deal with the influx of calls but faced opposition to even advertising her service in churches or bulletins across the country.Doyle said: ldquoWe are supporting eight Scottish people. Eight may seem like a small number to many, but for those eight people their lives have been hugely affected.ldquoThey have been hidden, they have had confidentiality agreements too. They are scared.ldquoWe have one Scottish woman we are working with who was fathered by an Irish priest. They moved to Scotland and hid her there and she has hidden ever since. She doesnrsquot know what to do or how to bring it up.ldquoThese people are terried. One guy I know has psychosis, hersquos on the verge of schizophrenia.ldquoWe have a lot of kids also from Ireland and England sent to Scotland, who were adopted but now through things like ancestry and DNA matching sites they are finding out their roots and what actually happened.ldquoThere are around  priests in Scotland at the minute, but how many men have been ordained in Scotland or how many Scottish men have been missionary priests over the last  years  That is where the real question is.ldquoWhen you take that into consideration,only % of those priests fathered children, yoursquore talking about a surprising number.ldquoOn a global level, we know about , children in this position and that is only the ones we know about, itrsquos a hugely conservative estimate.A Catholic church spokesman told The Herald on Sunday there was no evidence of ldquosignicant numbers of children fathered by priests in Scotland, and compared priests having relationships to an office worker having an extramarital affair with a colleague.He said in both scenarios, vows would have been broken but it would not necessarily be the responsibility of the employer to get involved.When pressed, he admitted the church had no idea of the numbers and he had only heard of one such case before, but insisted that Scottish bishops would support prieststhey came to them to ask for help.The spokesman said: ldquoIn the case of a priest who has fathered a child, it is not possible to rule out any possible responses to these situations.ldquoA decision to remain or leave the priesthood would be made on its merits in each case.ldquoThere are no central records of such cases and while the church would not necessarily be aware of them, there is no suggestion of signicant numbers in this country.He also said there had been several priests who had left the priesthood to pursue relationships, and in his view there was no stigma around the issue.He said: ldquoIf a priest was to say to his bishop that he had fathered a child and, whether he wanted help to leave the priesthood and set up as a father or to remain in the priesthood but be able to support the child, the church would do whatever they could to support either of those options.ldquoEvery year a number [of priests] leave to get married. One left from Glasgow last year, for example. In the past that would have been seen as much more scandalous and a stigma. The view now is that the church is grateful for the service that you have given.Doyle has criticised the remarks and called for the church in Scotland to take the lead in finding and supporting people fathered by priests, and to understand why many priests do not disclose they have children.He said: ldquoI absolutely condemn the use of that world lsquosignicantrsquo in any regard. This is clerical abuse. If there are only five or  children in Scotland, so what  Quantity never should come in to pastoral care.ldquoIn order for this issue to be addressed we have to do away with moralistic audacious statements and look at this practically and also empower the woman. If you empower the mother and say lsquoyou are far from alone, you donrsquot need to be afraidrsquo, it would help, instead of the woman being told they are the only person in Scotland who is in this situation, and they must keep quiet in order for the priest to be able to support them and not lose their job.ldquoI would go back to the Catholic bishops in Scotland and ask them what constitutes a signicant number. We are working with eight people ndash is that insignicant  I donrsquot know the full number of children of priests in Scotland, but neither do the bishops.ldquoThe Catholic church should be willing to bend over backwards for one child so this whole thing of lsquosignicancersquo is hugely disrespectful, harmful and what they are trying to do is make this inauthentic.ldquoThere are children of priests the same as there are children of plumbers, fishermen, hairdressers ... they are out there.ldquoAnd it is never going to stop. Unless they stop ordaining heterosexual males it will happen.

During one particular period, I wrote in the morning, tended my allotment in the afternoon, and sorted mail for the GPO in the evenings, back in the days when I could truly claim to be a man of letters.I was poor but as happy as Larry, whoever he is, and remembered that Karl Marx had pretty much described such a le under communism in his famous book, ldquoDas Allotments. A particularly pleasant memory is of spreading rotten seaweed on the soil and a blackbird being so transported with delight that, after scoffing his fill of wee microbes on the maritime manure, he came and sat and warbled on the toe of my boot as I lay back contented with my labours.Alas, every time it came time for cultivation, I had to abandon the plot, as I am one of those fellows who can never settle and is always moving on, usually with disastrous consequences.In my lectures to young people about le, I always tell them:.

Nor did I know that East Lothian had recently had its flag design registered ndash it looks like a Lion Rampant in a box being struck by thunderbolts. Or the stushie over the Sutherland one. The original design, which was a swooping eagle in red and yellow against the same colours, counterchanged, in the background, roused the ire of the locals, with one of the objectors claiming in evoked communism .The Lord Lyon, who seems to have a say in these things, halted the process and a design was finally chosen, after a public vote.

OK, so right now yoursquore probably seeing the information board at Glasgow Queen Street with the words ldquocancelled and ldquodelayed sprinkled across it, so letrsquos skip that and try for the fourth image which, pun intended, is bound to be the Forth Bridge.Nothing  evokes the romance of rail travel quite like this wonder of Victorian engineering, and for a relatively modest fee ndash aticket from Edinburgh Waverley to Inverkeithing, the first stop on the north side of the estuary ndash you can enjoy not one but two trips across it.However, an even better idea is to stay on until Aberdour, where you can disembark at one of Scotlandrsquos prettiest stations, walk the few yards to one of its most interesting castlesand then stroll downhill to the sandy town beach. Glasgow to MallaigProperly referred to as the West Highland Line, this beguiling stretch of rail is now better known to millennials as the Harry Potter Line thanks to the spectacular Glenfinnan Viaduct which the Hogwarts Express crosses in the blockbuster films. As the train chugs its way northwest from Glasgow there are glimpses of Ben Nevis, Loch Shiel and Loch Eilt, and you may even catch sight of the isles of Rum, Eigg, Muck and Canna.The line crosses desolate Rannoch Moor and passes through Corrour, the highest mainline station in the UK, but it also serves coastal Arisaig, where anyone disembarking can enjoy some of the whitest sands in the world.The entire line is regularly voted one of the most scenic on the planet so itrsquos already deserving of its place in the Cool List, butyou want to go the whole Hogwarts then hop on board The Jacobite, the steam-hauled train which runs between Fort William and Mallaig. Leadhills to WanlockheadIf geographical trivia is your specialist subject at the local pub quiz then you donrsquot need telling that Wanlockhead is Scotlandrsquos highest village or that itrsquos located not in the Highlands but in the Lowther Hills in Dumfries and Gallowayrsquos Southern Uplands. If all that comes as news to you and you fancy a visit, donrsquot miss this treat. The railway is a narrow gauge and runs along the track bed of what was once a branch line on the Caledonian Railway to Wanlockhead from nearby Elvanfoot.It closed in  and shortly afterwards the lead mines it served were mothballed, so now the railway mostly pulls tourists along the kilometre or so between the two villages. Naturally, Wanlockhead also boasts Scotlandrsquos highest pub, the perfect place to read Robert Burnsrsquos poem Pegasus At Wanlockhead, written over a dram in another local hostelry as he waited for the horse of that name to have a shoe tended to by the village blacksmith. Inverness to WickKnown as the Far North Line for obvious reasons, this four-and-a-half-hour, -mile journey sees the train follow the coast for much of the way. Among the stops is one practically at the gates of the magnicent Dunrobin Castle, completed in the s at the behest of the owner who quite fancied having his own railway line. It required the say-so of Parliament but given that the owner was the Duke of Sutherland, the permissions werenrsquot too hard to get.Other highlights include Skibo Castle, Foulis Castle, the atmospheric peat bogsand the distilleries of Teaninich, Dalmore, Balblair, Whyte  Mackay , Glenmorangie , and, in Wick itself, Pulteney . Inverness to Kyle of LochalshIf yoursquore heading for Skye from the capital of the Highlands, then the so-called Kyle Line is the only way to travel. The line runs along the Beauly Firth, through Dingwall and on past villages such as Achnashellach, Achnasheen, Lochcarron and picturesque Plockton, where much-loved BBC drama Hamish Macbeth was filmed. Naturally there are great views of Skye itself at the end of the line but along the way yoursquoll also see the Torridon Peaks, Ben Wyvis, Loch Luichart and Loch Carron as well as some rugged Highland scenery. Aviemore to BroomhillThe route isnrsquot so much the treat here as the train itself because itrsquos on these  miles of restored track from the original Highland Railway Line that the Strathspey Steam Railway has run since it was brought back to le by a group of enthusiasts in . It runs between Aviemore stationrsquos  three and Broomhillrsquos Glenbogle station via Boat of Garten and when yoursquore not looking out of the window at the sceneryyoursquoll be looking around the old-style carriages or even down at your plate ndash the service offers all manner of dining experiences, from light lunches and afternoon teas to formal evening meals. Dufftown to KeithThis -mile line links the Moray towns of Keith and Dufftown, the self-styled ldquoWhisky Capital of the World . Predictably the line itself, once part of the Aberdeen to Elgin line, is known now as the Whisky Line and also bills itself the UKrsquos most northerly ldquoheritage railway. The rolling stock includes old commuter carriages from the s and s, and a dining coach which used to be part of the British Rail InterCity stock, but which has been repainted and renamed Spirit Of Dufftown. The line is closed for the winter and reopens on April . Borsquoness to Manuel JunctionOne of Scotlandrsquos most popular heritage railways, the Borsquoness and Kinneil Railway runs five miles between Borsquoness near Falkirk and Manuel Junction, via Kinneil and Birkhill. The views are pretty enough but again itrsquos the rolling stock which is the star.Among the favourites are  Neilson Reid locomotive Lord Roberts, which has been painted Thomas The Tank Engine blue, a set of s coaches in whatrsquos known as a ldquoblood and custard livery, and a pair of Caledonian coaches built in . Borsquoness is also home to the Museum of Scottish Railways, which houses historic locomotives, carriages, cranes, wagonsas well as shunting units, motorised trolleys and all manner of objects and archive stuff. Edinburgh to TweedbankThe Borders line, closed in  as part of the infamous Beeching cuts, reopened with no little fanfare in September  and reconnected the capital with the Borders towns of Galashiels and Melroseas well as Midlothian towns such as Dalkeith, Newtongrange and Gorebridge. The scenery is pleasant enough ndash go to the Highlandsyou want mountains and lochs ndash but the appeal of the Borders Railway, as itrsquos now known, lies in its ality and its historical importance: its rebirth brought a new dynamism and opportunity to a part of the country too often overlooked, and signicant numbers of tourists as well. Book lovers in particular have good reason to take the trip. Where  can you take a train which starts from a station named after a famous novel ndash Waverley, by Sir Walter Scott ndash and terminates close to the authorrsquos home, in this case Abbotsford, near Melrose  Milton of Crathes to Birkenbaud CrossingItrsquos only a mile of track along the now-disused Ballater to Aberdeen line, but as the name suggests the Royal Deeside Railway is steeped in history, thanks to the fact that for over a century, until its closure in , it was used by the royal family travelling to Ballater and from there to nearby Balmoral Castle. It was even used by ill-fated Russian tsar Nicholas II when he visited in .The original Crathes Castle station was built initially for the private use of the Laird of Crathes, and only later was the public allowed to use it. The Milton of Crathes station features a Victorian building but it came originally from Oldmeldrum and was sold to the Royal Deeside Railway for pound then transported to its new home in carefully labelled sections.The line has both steam- and diesel-hauled trains and among the former is the Thomas The Tank Engine-style Salmon.

Some of the brightest minds, and biggest voices, are calling for him to pull to the left, pull to the right, protect the poor, and boost business ndash all at the same time. Mackay ndash self-contained, confident and smartly dressed ndash may see himself as a steady pair of hands, but hersquod need the skill of a juggler to make everyone happy.At its heart, the Budget is redistributive ndash taking from the rich to provide services for the poor by widening the gap between how much higher earners pay in income tax in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. Mackay has frozen the higher rate threshold at pound, in Scotland, while it will go up to pound, in the rest of the UK. However, everyone earning under pound, ndash % of taxpayers ndash will end up paying less income tax than in the rest of the UK.The spending plans also provide extra money for education , health , and infrastructure , and give new powers to councils to introduce a workplace car parking tax and a tourist tax. Local authorities get an extra poundm and can also increase council tax by up to .% rather than %.But what do the people who spend their lives studying the Scottish economy make of the Budget  Does the way Scotland spends its money work  Where could money be spent better  And what ideas might change the game when it comes to Scotland and out public services Some of the leading lights in Scottish public le give their views.PROFESSOR RONALD MACDONALDECONOMIST WITH THE ADAM SMITH BUSINESS SCHOOL AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITYRonnie MacDonald is happy to pay more tax, but he isnrsquot so happy with the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to balancing the books. ldquoThe focus seems to be too much on spending ndash there isnrsquot so much emphasis on growing the economy, he says.About half the revenue raised comes from taxes, he says, and our ldquoeconomy is very skewed towards oil ndash a commodity in price decline. ldquoItrsquos a dangerous strategy for the long-term sustainability of public spending, MacDonald says.With limited borrowing powers, the Government has a choice between \"growing the economy or spending less\". The Government is following a Nordic-style model of public spending, he says.However, ldquothese Nordic countries grew their economies before making spending changes, we seem to be doing it the other way around.ldquoI think wersquoll ultimately have to cut spending, he adds. ldquoYou either prioritise and have a leaner mix now, or yoursquore forced to do it in the future ndash you could face much worse cuts in the future.Higher taxes in Scotland ldquomay well put off foreign firms thinking of investing in Scotland, he says. ldquoIf Irsquom a US-based company thinking of Scotland or the north of England, Irsquom going to go where the tax regime is more favourable to my employees. All in all itrsquos quite a dangerous game theyrsquore playing.Macdonald suggests a ldquorealignment from spending ldquotowards lowering business rates to encourage growth.A more erse economy would grow more quickly, says MacDonald, and provide the money needed for the ldquopublic provision the SNP wants to offer. Manufacturing around le sciences and new technology is one way forward.MacDonald suggests Scotland should follow the path of Australia ndash currently blazing a trail with the solar production of renewable hydrogen as a green energy source. Renewable hydrogen, says MacDonald, can be stored and shipped in liquid form. Given Scotlandrsquos wind and waves, wersquod be in a perfect position to exploit the new technology in the era of climate change.ldquoIt could be revolutionary, MacDonald says. ldquoIt could be as important as the discovery of oil ... it could lead to the reindustrialisation of Scotland.If the Government used public money to invest in the new technology ldquoit could create a sovereign wealth fund as the Norwegians did to use oil to pay for services.DAVE MOXHAMSTUC DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARYldquoThe Budget is incredibly timid, says Moxham. ldquoWith the current ambition of a little bit more tax on middle- to higher-income earners, itrsquos quite impossible to fund the public services we need without the recognition that people on median and above incomes are going to have to pay more in taxation.\"We canrsquot pretend therersquos any mechanism for funding public services which doesnrsquot have that sort of ambition.ldquoItrsquos not enough to constantly use a Conservative Government as a comparator and say wersquore being slightly more progressive. Any party which aspires to say Scotland would be dferent under independence needs to be showing more now about what their commitment is to social justice.The STUC, says Moxham, would be ldquocomfortable with everyone above median income ndash about pound, ndash paying an extra penny in tax. ldquoThatrsquos small change. Itrsquos hardly bank-breaking, he adds.Spending needs to get smarter and more local too, Moxham says. Councils and council staff need more say in spending ndash as they understand the problems. ldquoTherersquos too much centralisation and not enough devolution to local authorities, he adds.He cites hospitals improving heart failure response times because ldquothe porters helped design the system of getting someone from the front steps to the operating theatre.ldquoWersquove had lots of reorganisation of the delivery of public services but these have tended to be executive-led, he says. Whatrsquos needed is getting the people who deliver the services ndash carers, nurses, teachers ndash to help design services. ldquoThe person who best knows how to organise a home care service is probably the home carer on the ground.The big idea that the STUC is investigating is a ldquouniversal basic infrastructure ndash where everyone has the guaranteed right to decent transport, housing, clinics and schools. Public spending priorities would be re-engineered around making sure every citizen had the basic infrastructure for a decent le.Small business bonus schemes are in the STUCrsquos sights. ldquoWe need a completely new approach to business tax giveaways, says Moxham. Investing in specic high-street regeneration schemes ldquois a far better way to rebuild our local high streets than the current approach where someone may need the boost, but others are using it to fund a second car.TRACY BLACKDIRECTOR OF CBI SCOTLANDIF the Government stimulates the white heat of technology it can fill its coffers with tax pounds and use the money to spend on the public services it wants ndash thatrsquos essentially Blackrsquos view.A no-deal Brexit could cost Scotland poundbn a year by , she says, and our demographics are going against us with a rapidly ageing population, so we need to start spending as smartly as we can. AI and automation could reduce costs. The elderly donrsquot have to travel to hospital when their blood pressure could be checked by remote monitoring. Investment in smart-ticketing and autonomous vehicles could help the high street.Glasgow may be a G hub, but connectivity needs improved across the country, as does infrastructure, Black says, so ldquowe get goods and people moving around more effectively.One big idea that Black is promoting is using national data to change how we spend public money. Data on the economy and population could be used by business ldquoto come up with really creative solutions around transport and health.The Scottish Government has done well so far supporting science and technology in business. Black says our pharma manufacturing sector is one of the most advanced in the world ndash itrsquos now the second-biggest spender on research and development, exports poundm in products, and has seen jobs rise by .%. The Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre in Renfrewshire was l funded by the Government and industry.Itrsquos this close working relationship between Government and industry that Black wants more of ndash but she feels there are ldquomixed messages when it comes to income tax, parking levies and the tourist tax. ldquoNone of these on their own are particularly crippling, but you put the whole package together and what sort of signal does that put out to inward investors PROFESSOR GRAEME ROYDIRECTOR OF THE FRASER OF ALLANDER INSTITUTE\"THE debate around public spending collapses down into short-term political sound bites rather than more intelligent conversations,\" says Roy. \"We see that every week at First Ministerrsquos Questions and in every manesto that every party produces.\"Parties obsess on issues like \", more nurses or , extra police officers\" when they should be looking at outcomes ndash like extending le expectancy or making streets safer. It may be that spending more money on housing rather than nurses will improve le expectancy. Preventative measures ndash that improve health or cut crime ndash will save money in the long run.\"Simple metrics donrsquot do anything for the long-term delivery of better value for public services,\" Roy says. \"Therersquos a fixation on targets and numbers when the evidence is that you should be bolder.\"He adds: \"If wersquore thinking about long-term sustainability of public services what we need to do is reduce demand, not just keep increasing supply.\"Such a quantum sht in how we look at public spending would require political courage. Politicians are locked in short election cycles, while long-term preventative policies might take decades to show fruit, Roy says. Closing a hospital because it makes more sense to spend the money on nutrition for the young could lose a government an election, even though  years from now it might have improved health.\"Some of the delivery of public services is simply not going to be sustainable in the long run,\" Roy says. \"Wersquove played with numbers where we think that on current projections NHS spending will within the next two or three years be pretty much % of the Scottish Budget. This will mean every other area in the public sector has to be squeezed ndash thatrsquos the sort of thing which I think will start to force more radical thoughts on how we deliver public services.\"JOHN DICKIEDIRECTOR, CHILD POVERTY ACTION GROUPDickie is clear that Scotlandrsquos public spending does not match the ambition of the Government when it comes to tackling child poverty. Targets have been set that less than % of children should be living in poverty by .With currently one in four Scots children in poverty ndash thatrsquos about , ndash to reach that target, says Dickie, \"we need a substantial rethink of how we raise revenue and allocate resources to make sure those families on the lowest incomes can give children a decent start in le\". Estimates show that one in three children could be in poverty within a few years.Dickie wants an \"income supplement\" to lt family finances to levels above the poverty line. The government is committed to introducing an income supplement by  ndash however, it hasnrsquot said how that will be delivered or how much it will be.The supplement needs brought in now, Dickie says. \"Families canrsquot wait until .\" He applauds policies like best start grants for families, and improvements in school clothing grants but says \"none of this is on the scale to have the kind of substantive long-term impact to really change the trajectory of child poverty\".Dickie would also like to see the Scottish Government act to top up child benefit by around pound, following cuts by the UK Government.Not tackling child poverty is a drain on the economy ndash with children more likely to get involved in crime, have poor health, and fewer job prospects. \"The government needs to act with urgency,\" Dickie says. It needs to \"recognise the value of the next generation\" and invest.DEREK MITCHELLCHIEF EXECUTIVE, CITIZENS ADVICE SCOTLANDWHEN there are families going to foodbanks and receiving \"cold bags\" of shopping because their gas and electricity has been cut off ndash when % of people in \"food poverty\" are working ndash then for Mitchell \"that doesnrsquot paint a picture of a society where everything is wonderful and great\".\"The simple matter is,\" he says, \"that things are very dficult for lots of people and that doesnrsquot show any sign of abating.\"Public resources need to go to those most in need, Mitchell says. \"Poor people donrsquot have a voice.

This is a man who didnrsquot grow up easy ndash raised in a council house, he even spent time in a homeless unit after a family break-up. He puts his le lessons into his policies ndash beliefs like ldquothe importance of community, kindness, treating others as you would be treated yourself.ldquoIrsquom very aware of chaotic lestyles, lack of opportunities, intergenerational poverty, he says. Mackay says he struck it lucky by entering politics and getting elected. It changed the direction of his le.Hersquos got a slick command of his portfolio and can rattle off statistics at a dizzying rate ndash but his Budget is assailed from all sides: itrsquos either a hit on the middle classes or it isnrsquot doing enough for the poor.Criticism doesnrsquot faze Mackay though ndash only once does he falter, and even then momentarily, when asked why the SNP needed the Greens to push them in a more progressive direction over policies like the parking levy.In his eyes, the Budget is about stability in the face of ldquocalamity at Westminster sustainability of public services, and stimulus for the economy.Mackay says preventative measures are built in when it comes to public health and early years ndash and the economy of the future is being looked after in terms of innovation on data and infrastructure. Direct investment in Scotland is second only to London, and research and development is at record levels. He makes much of new figures showing unemployment is at an all-time low.However, therersquos only so much the Government can do given the limited range of powers granted to a devolved administration, he says. ldquoWe can grow the economy as an independent countrywe have control of levers like immigration policy, and over a wider basket of taxation powers.Mackay described his current Budget as ldquofair and progressive in that it takes ldquoa bit more from the highest earning section of society. In the next financial year, he says, ldquo% of taxpayers will pay less tax, not more, on their current incomes, and itrsquos only those on or above pound, who will pay more.Itrsquos a ldquobalanced and moderate approach, he thinks. ldquoWersquore building a social security system with a dferent philosophy around dignity and respect, he said, while claiming the UK Government was in a ldquorace to the bottom on tax.While Mackay attempts to create a more progressive Budget, he insists hersquos also trying to remain pro-business as he believes ldquothe best social policy is employment. He dismissed claims of ldquoclass war in his Budget.ldquoIf we donrsquot invest in society and have the necessary safeguards for all then everyone pays for societal failure ndash business and taxpayers pay for this with prisons and unemployment, he says, adding that he believes his Budget presents a ldquopretty good deal.Reformation of council tax is likely to dominate the political discussion soon with plans for cross-party talks to find an alternative. ldquoIf we can find the consensus that could adequately and safety replace it then wersquoll support that, Mackay says. Legislation could be prepared in this Parliament for implementation in the next.Come the end of this Parliament, the country will also be heading towards the time for a review of the ldquofiscal framework set out by the Smith Commission and Scotland Act, which will mean the Government can ask for more powers from Westminster.Mackay admits such an ask wonrsquot be easy as ldquoWestminster concedes nothing without challenge and pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-just-what-is-going-on-in-haiti","story":"THERE is nothing like a coup drsquoetat to bring out the headcase and the hedonist in people.When I first visited Haiti back in , aside from the countryrsquos legions of poor, it seemed almost entirely inhabited by these two species of inidual.The capital Port-au-Prince was in meltdown back then, the cityrsquos ramshackle streets a labyrinth of barricades and blazing tyres, looters, shooters and partygoers.President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in the process of being deposed from power. In the space of a few weeks, I would watch those same \"bouleds\" once consumed by violence and littered with corpses turn into one giant carnival as thousands crammed to dance the night away to Haitian and Caribbean music.Everywhere around the national palace that had been Aristidersquos lair of power, giant floats drted by while women in flamingo pink dresses, and voodoo priests, partied against the pure white backdrop of the whitewashed palace facade that dazzled in the nighttime dark like an edice of snow.There are few countries in the world that Irsquove been to quite like Haiti. Even fewer that have seen so much turmoil and destruction. It really does beggar belief that such a place exists an hour-and-a-halfrsquos flight from glittering Miami, and less than three hours from New York City. As the books and experts will attest to, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and the worldrsquos least developed outside of Africa ndash and believe me does it show.At night in the cityrsquos Marche en Fer or Iron Market district, crushing poverty forces sex workers, some little more than children, onto the filthy fire-lit streets.This is a two-tier nation that rises from the slums of Cite Soleil and Saint Martin, where hundreds of thousands cram into reclaimed swampland and cemeteries.So congested is it here that people I met said that ldquosht sleeping is common.With many single cupboard-sized rooms too small to house an entire family at any one time, people have been known to bed down on a rota basis, four hours inside and four hours in the alleyways outside.It might be a short distance as the crow flies in Port-au-Prince, but these teeming, humid slums are a world apart from the cool hills above where the wealthy live in the gated communities of Petionville, with their fine restaurants catering to a very dferent side of Haitian le.Right there in that very juxtaposition Haitirsquos inequality lies encapsulated. A chasm between haves and have-nots that for decades has led to political instability and violence which these past weeks has once again reared up and gripped the country.ldquoAfter each election, we are deeper and deeper in a crisis. People are living day-by-day ... If you donrsquot resolve the situation, yoursquoll have another uprising, warned Jean Clarens Renois, a former journalist and presidential candidate last week as street protests in the country intensied.For the last two weeks now, almost unnoticed by the international media, thousands of Haitians have taken to the streets, asking for US-backed president Jovenel Moise and his government to resign. Writing in the New York Times a few months ago, Jake Johnston, an international associate at the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington and an expert on Haiti, told the story of what sparked the current round of unrest.ldquoIt started with a few keystrokes in a living room in Montreal, he wrote.ldquoGilbert Mirambeau Jr, a Haitian filmmaker and writer, took to Twitter on August  to post a photo of himself, blindfolded, holding a piece of cardboard with a simple question written on it in Haitirsquos Creole: ldquoKot Kob Petwo Karibe a    ndash Where is the Petrocaribe money   As Johnston went on to explain in the article, just a few days after Mirambeaursquos tweet, an informal group of young Haitians organised on social media using the hashtag #PetroCaribeChallenge and since then Haitians from all sectors of society have taken to the streets demanding an answer to Mirambeaursquos original question about what became of the Petrocaribe cash.This vast sum of over  billion is part of low-interest loans provided by Petrocaribe, a Venezuela-led oil-purchasing alliance of Caribbean states that since  was aimed at helping Haitirsquos ailing economy. The funds became crucial emergency money to the country following the devastating earthquake of  that laid waste to swathes of Port-au-Prince and beyond.Since then, the missing cash and whole Petrocaribe affair has become a political cause celebre in a country where ordinary people have seen a % hike in fuel prices and double-digit inflation that has made day-to-day survival extremely challenging for more than % of the population.For decades, ordinary Haitians have felt themselves powerless when confronted with this ongoing legacy of corruption and misgovernment. Presented with few alternative options, iniably they take to the streets as a last resort when trying to change things for the better.With so many locked in the grip of protracted poverty their frustration with the countryrsquos level of corruption is understandable. To take but one example following the  earthquake, it became clear that despite foreign donors pledging more than  billion in aid, less than % of that emergency aid spent in their names went directly to Haitians.I well recall in the wake of the earthquake talking to ordinary Haitians who had lost almost everything. One was a woman called Gladys Pierre, a mother who described that day back in  when just before five orsquoclock the mirrors fell from the walls in her family home and the furniture rose up and flew through the air asthrown by a giant malevolent poltergeist.ldquoA big beam slid, and from the chest up Rachelle was crushed against the wall like a mosquito, and I knew my little girl had died, Gladys told me, her voice trailing off.Unimaginable as the horror of her story was, it didnrsquot stop there. Steeling herself, she continued to tell of how her daughterrsquos semi-crushed skull became a grotesque prop for part of the apartment block wall that remained standing.In the following months, so dangerous were those ruins teetering on their macabre headstone that no-one dared enter to remove Rachellersquos corpse.Like many ordinary Haitians who found themselves now living in one of the tarpaulin cities that became semi-permanent fixtures in Port-au-Prince, Gladys and her husband Joel held out little hope of those in power doing much to improve their lives.ldquoYou only see them in their beautul cars and big jeeps driving up and down but they never stop, never get out of the car, talk to us or even congratulate the women and children on their courage, I recall Joel telling me at the time.And so, in the eyes of many Haitians, this sense of helplessness and frustration remains the way they see their lives and once again anger has boiled over in the country.While president Moise has pledged a crackdown on corruption few see little signs of it. Those who have taken to the streets as part of the protest movement in recent weeks have no clear political leader, but Haiti has a huge diaspora that has harnessed social media in its non-violent #PetroCaribeChallenge, campaigning among a population more than half of whom are under  years old.As ever, though, tensions have risen as government repression against the campaigners has become more unrestrained and brutal. Even in the early stages the signs of this were all too clear when last November armed gangs close to the ruling party, together with corrupt police officers, massacred at least  people just days before protests were due to begin.All this time, US influence ndash official or unofficial ndash has never been far from the surface in Haiti. In the latest case of murky US interference, five heavily-armed Americans were arrested in Port-au-Prince last week along with a Haitian man and two Serbians.The Americans are former Navy Seal officers Christopher Michael Osman and Christopher Mark McKinley, and Marine veteran Kent Leland Kroeker, as well as Talon Ray Burton and Dustin Porte. Burton is a private investigator once employed by the controversial private security company formerly known as Blackwater and the State Departmentrsquos diplomatic security service. Inside their vehicles the Haitian police found six automatic rles, six pistols, two professional drones and three satellite phones, and they were also carrying sets of licence plates.ldquoThey said that they were here on a lsquogovernment mission,rsquo ldquo Miami Herald reporter Jacqueline Charles told US National Public Radio. ldquoThey did not specy which government, but then they did tell the police that ... their boss was going to call their boss.Whether they were mercenaries, ldquogovernment contractors of something , the arrest of the Americans while failing to make global headlines triggered wide speculation about why they were in Haiti, particularly among Moisersquos political foes.The possible explanations range from a desire to protect the central bank or foreign assets to potential attacks on anti-government demonstrators and leaders. According to the Haitian police, the men claimed they were on a ldquogovernment mission when they were pulled over about a block away from the nationrsquos central bank.The US government only subsequently intervened after Haitian prime minister Jean Henry Ceant, speaking on CNN, called the group ldquomercenaries and ldquoterrorists. That they were released from prison and immediately flown back to Miami where they faced no charges has only further fuelled the rumour mill and caused political uproar in Haiti.Pierre Esperance, executive director of the National Human Rights Defence Network in Haiti, blasted the decision by US authorities not to charge the men.ldquoWhat the Haitian government did is grave. It shows that they had something they were looking for. The fact that the US took these people and did not charge them, it shows there was a conspiracy. They didnrsquot want them to go before Haitian justice, he told the Miami Herald.On Friday, the protests on the streets of Port-au-Prince showed no signs of abating. ldquoToday we lock down the country again, opposition leader Schiller Louidor told people who gathered for a funeral of two protesters killed earlier in the week, before they marched on the national palace carrying one of the coffins. ldquoWe are asking for justice. We are going to continue to protest. Jovenel Moise can kill as many people as he wants, he still has to go, said Josef Dicles, a cousin of one of the dead men, Onique Gedeus.And so Haiti is mired in turmoil again and just what the future holds is anybodyrsquos guess. But the mysterious presence of armed Americans and the cancellation of this monthrsquos scheduled carnival in Port-au-Prince certainly bodes ill for this long-suffering nation born out of slavery and still consigned to poverty."},{"url":null,"title":"chuka-umunna-urges-voters-to-join-movement-for-different-kind-of-politics","story":"In a sign that The Independent Groupwill form a fully-fledged parliamentary party, the former Labour MP called for the public to ldquojoin us, and help us forge a new, dferent kind of politics for Britainrsquos future.Our political system is clearly completely broken.

The new software — which can be used on desktops and mobile browsers — allows website visitors to customise what they see and hear, from changing the contrast settings, language, font size and more.In the UK, there are estimated to be . million people with a learning disability and . million people who have English as a second language. ‘Recite Me’ has the ability to translate the NorthLink Ferries website into more than  languages — including Scots Gaelic . It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us. We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupSunday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The annual Franco-Scottish Society Alexander Gray Fund Lecture in Inverness on Friday promises to be alight-hearted bilingual talk from Ms Walker and her \"long-suffering\" Parisian translator Richard Kausch.Major Tomrsquos War is a moving novel set in France during the First World War, in part in the grim lsquozones occupeacuteesrsquo of northern France.Its characters are real people ndash and both author and translator have had to enter the minds of the novelrsquos key protagonists.The novel is published in English by Kashi House in London and the French edition should follow late this year or early in .Veeand Richard will be touring four of the regional Franco-Scottish Societies of Scotland this month.The groups exist to foster French language and culture in Scotland and meet monthly for French conversation or a lecture.Those who come along are welcome to join or to attend as a non-member.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible. Savings have to be made, but sticking rigidly to a timetable leaves little time to form development groups.Sunday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery. If that help was not there when I needed it, the outcome could have been very dferent.The other said: ldquoHearing a voice that was willing to listen to me was a relief on one of the darkest days of my le.Sunday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

But, so far, not in this instance. Some have greeted their departure with a sense of triumphalism that they are “not Labour” or “should join the Tories”. Others have spent the last few years hounding, harassing and bullying those very MPs in order to force them to leave the Labour Party. I think they are all missing the point.I’m angry at that approach but I am angrier at the reaction from the Labour leadership. What we needed last Monday was a moment for reflection.The MPs who have resigned their lelong association with the Labour Party have taken this heartbreaking decision not as an act of sabotage or spite but as a very last resort at a situation they felt was untenable. They also set out a challenge to the Labour Party leadership. Those challenges should have been thought about and dealt with. But instead we got a cloth-eared response that essentially dismissed their concerns.I’ve never been involved in the professional world of human resources, but I am sure in any other organisation there would have been a little bit of soul searching to ensure no others would leave, and to try and address the fundamentally important reasons for their leaving in the first place.And the challenges they set are fundamental.They rightly said that the current official Labour Party position to prevent a public vote with the option to remain in the EU, which is the Labour Party policy agreed at our conference, was not in the national interest, and is playing members and the rest of the country for “fools”.They rightly said that the Labour Party was lack-lustre at best and turning a blind eye at worst to the scourge of anti-Semitism that seems to be enveloping the party.They said that the bullying and intimidation of MPs was unbearable and this was being tolerated by the Labour leadership’s inability or unwillingness to do anything about it. And they rightly said that the current Labour Party was only that in name and the party they joined was no longer the one they recognised today.There is little doubt that our politics is broken, and the party system is breaking down.Many voters see themselves as being politically homeless and that is why the new Independent Group should not just be dismissed.If they capture the imagination of the public, demonstrate that our politics is broken, develop policies for all of the country, and guide themselves by the national interest, they will talk to a very large number of voters. At the very least, they may well recalibrate British politics.So, the Labour Party is at a crossroads. The leadership can either see the events of this week as a wake-up call and try to address the issues that have been raised or they can carry on with business as usual. I would plead with them to go with the former, but I fear they have already set the trajectory for the latter.If they take the wrong route now the public will look for something that better reflects their hopes and aspirations for a credible alternative government to this wretched Tory administration and it won’t be anyone’s fault but their own.I have no plans to join them, but Tom Watson MP was correct when he said, “I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it.”Those who have left have put the Labour Party on notice and I certainly don’t blame them for standing up for what they believe in. I just wish the Labour leadership would recognise the problem and listen, acknowledge, reflect, and reform.Ian Murray is Labour MP\u2028for Edinburgh South©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"peers summon jeremy corbyn over exodus of mps from labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been summoned to address Labour peers amid fears members of the group in the House of Lords could join a growing exodus from the party.At a meeting this week following the resignation of seven of the party’s MPs, Labour peers were united in anger at the response to allegations of anti-Semitism by the leadership.Only one peer at Wednesday’s meeting – writer and campaigner Baroness Bryan of Partick, who was appointed to the Lords by Corbyn in June – spoke up in defence of the Labour leader, a source told Scotland on Sunday.At the end of the stormy gathering, peers agreed to ask Corbyn to address them and explain what was being done to respond to the concerns raised by defecting MPs.Explaining her decision to quit, the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Bergersaid the Labour party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic”.Another parliamentarian who quit Labour on Friday, the Dudley North MP Ian Austin, said his Jewish father came to the UK as a child refugee in  while his family remained in Czechoslovakia and were murdered in the Holocaust.“I don’t think I could look at my dad in the eyeI stayed in the Labour Party,” he said.One Labour peer said colleagues fear senior Jewish members of the Labour group in the Lords could quit.The source said senior figures such as former English FA chairman Lord Triesman and the one-time Labour donor Lord Levy were considering their positions.“Only one person defended him [Corbyn]: Baroness Bryan,” the source said.Peers considered sending a deputation to the Labour leader, but a majority insisted he be called to address them. One Jewish peer told colleagues that it was “dficult to go amongst the Jewish community and be a member of the Labour party”.Responding to the wave of resignations, the peers were nearly unanimous in saying they “understand what they’re doing” and “neither condone nor condemn it”, the source said.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell admitted that the party needed to be “quicker and fiercer” in responding toincidents of anti-Semitism.In a bid to calm the anger over his handling of the anti-Semitism storm, Corbyn appointed the former minister Lord Falconer to lead a review of the party’s processes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"shamima begum they are making an example of me islamic state bride speaks out","story":"Islamic State bride Shamima Begum said she regrets speaking to the media and wishes she had found a dferent way to contact her family.The teenager, who fled London aged  to join Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria, has said she wants toto the UK with her newborn son.Ms Begum, who has had her British citizenship revoked, was one of three schoolgirls to leave Bethnal Green to join the terror cult in  and resurfaced heavily pregnant at a Syrian refugee camp last week.: Dani Garavelli: Can justice rise above a lynch mob mentality Speaking to The Sundayfrom the al-Hol camp in Syria, Ms Begum said: “They are making an example of me.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DUNVEGAN-CASTLE-SNOWDROPS-3.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already.

We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"m22 closure after four vehicles in collision","story":"The M northbound is closed between the Ballygrooby Road and Moneynick Road junctions after a collision involving four vehicles on Friday night.

I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kfc footage proves man didnt burgle home claim","story":"THE brother of a man who’s been remanded in prison for his alleged involvement in an aggravated burglary in Ligoniel on Friday night says he is innocent.Daniel Lundy says his brother Alan was targeted in an MI-directed operation by the PSNI. He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker. There are four definitions of abuse: physical, psychological, sexual and neglect. No-one can tell me that Alan Lundy’s children being dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night is not psychological abuse of children.“Alan Lundy personies what is happening to republicans across the six counties. It should also be pointed out that Alan has never been convicted of anything under what the British government callthe Terrorism Act.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-14.19.53.png","title":"that battered can is kicked again","story":"IN  the intense focus of many in the policing debates in our community was the lack of progress on legacy matters. It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":null,"title":"eu cannot compromise on brexit deal to placate conservative brexiteers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And he offered a global review of the broader societal problem of sexual tourism and online pornography, in a bid to contextualise what he said was once a taboo subject.But he said the sexual abuse of children becomes even more scandalous when it occurs in the Catholic Church, “for it is utterly incompatible with her moral authority and ethical credibility”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis celebrates Mass at the Vatican “We need to recognise with humility and courage that we stand face-to-face with the mystery of evil, which strikes most violently against the most vulnerable, for they are an image of Jesus,” he said.Francis summoned the bishops from around the world to the four-day meeting to impress upon them that clergy sex abuse and cover-ups are not just a problem in some countries but a global problem that threatens the very mission of the Catholic Church.“Brothers and sisters, today we find ourselves before a manestation of brazen, aggressive and destructive evil,” the pope said.He offered an eight-point pledge of priorities going forward, calling for a change in the church’s defensive mentality and a vow to never again cover-up cases. Victims, he said, must take centre stage while priests must undergo a continuing path of purity with the “holy fear of God” guiding the examination of their own failures.“In people’s justied anger, the church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted by these deceitful consecrated persons,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"relocation of us army base in japan gets put to public vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Critics say wildle such as coral reefs and the dugong will be hurt.“There are so many American troops here. Of course,  percent of them are good people, but then there is that  percent who do evil things. It’s hard for us,” said Tomomichi Shimabukuro, who runs a seaside inn called Churaumi-kun.I feel most people of Okinawa are going to vote in protest of the planFacebookTwitter“I feel most people of Okinawa are going to vote in protest of the plan,” he said.Japanese media surveys have suggested voters are likely to reject the Henoko plan.Nearly . million residents,  or older, are eligible to vote, and turnout is expected to be high. Interest has been strong, not only in the rest of Japan but among pacists internationally.The referendum asks: “On the landfill for the construction of the U.S. military base planned by the government in Henoko, Nago city, to replace Futenma air base,” with the answers being: “I agree,” ”I oppose,” and “Neither.”Although Okinawa makes up less than % of Japan’s land space, it houses about half of the , American troops stationed in Japan, and makes for % of the land used by the US bases, under a bilateral security treaty.Japan relies heavily on the U.S. for its defence, and the government has said it will not abide by the referendum, eventhe Henoko plan is rejected.Over the years, Henoko has drawn countless protests and sit-ins.We are committed to maintaining good relations with local communities on Okinawa and do our best every day to balance their concerns with the necessity to maintain readiness in support of our treaty commitmentsFacebookTwitterThe election last year of Okinawa governor Denny Tamaki, whose father is a Marine he has never met and his mother a Japanese, has injected renewed energy to the movement.Sceptics are worried the costs for a landfill base like Henoko may keep growing, the runway may end up being too short and the government may not close Futenma, after all.Colonel John Hutcheson, a spokesman for US Forces Japan, said the Henoko agreement is a bilateral deal aimed at closing Futenma, while maintaining what he called vital capabilities for regional security.He declined to comment on the referendum, saying it was a domestic political issue.“We are committed to maintaining good relations with local communities on Okinawa and do our best every day to balance their concerns with the necessity to maintain readiness in support of our treaty commitments,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"cusack calls completion cregganburn lighting","story":"SDLP Councillor for Foyleside has called on the Council to finish the installation of lighting in the local Cregganburn Park between the Glen Road and Rosemount.Cllr Cusack explained that the regeneration of the Cregganburn Park started four years ago in January  with £k funding from what was then the Department for Regional Development, however, it is still incomplete.She commented: \"This budget was to cover many major aspects of the greenway scheme but was insufficient to fully illuminate all the pathways in the area.\"In March last year I was relieved to see Council respond proactively and oversee the lighting of the section from the Baldrick steps to the middle crossroads, which I’d lobbied continuously for.

Since  we have lost EU PEACE funding and this has added to a substantialin overall funding. We really are in need of fund raising from the public to help keep us going.Glebe House manager Diarmaid McGarrigle blames the rise in student overheads as one reason for the shortage of dedicated volunteers, calling it a ldquopoor indictment on our society.Mr McGarrigle said up until a few years ago Glebe House benefited from a ldquoteam of dedicated, driven and enthusiastic helpers.He said that is no longer the case because students were now having to seek paid employment to cover tuition fees and other costs.ldquoIt is a shame because young groups need volunteers from their own peer group to relate to, he explained.ldquoWe can offer volunteers a wide iety of skills to choose from as we have  acres of farm land, animals to look after and an environment to plan and maintain. We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal.

The work is expected to take seven weeks to complete.Contractors are due to begin work in the centre of Saintfield on March  and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is urging people to be patient during the scheme.Today, between pm and pm, Phoenix officials will be hosting a public information event at the Rowallane Community Hub in Main Street to outline the programme of work and discuss it with residents and the business community.Phoenix says it is making signicant progress on its East Down investment proposal and revealed that Transport NI is managing a number of other construction programmes in surrounding areas which include road closures.Cllr Walker said as a result, Phoenix has been asked to bring forward its work in the town centre to fit in with other planned projects in the area.He also confirmed that the new pipeline programme has been discussed with several community representatives including Saintfield Development Association officials and a representative from Saintfield Traderrsquos Group who had expressed concern aboutthe works taking place in September.While Phoenix admits that the construction programme will ldquoinevitably not be convenient for a number of residents and business owners, it says bringing the work forward by six months will result in the most disruptive set of works being completed by late April or early May, rather than later in the year.Company officials have also visited businesses to outline the nature of the work, with Phoenix undertaking to do all it can during the construction process to accommodate business needs.Officials plan to work closely with the townrsquos Development Association and provide funding for a lsquoshop localrsquo campaign to encourage trade within Saintfield as work on the scheme continues.Residents in the area affected by the pipe laying work have also been informed about the change in the construction timetable.Cllr Walker, who is a keen supporter of bringing natural gas to East Down to provide consumers with an additional element of choice when it comes to their energy supplier, hopes contractors will not encounter any signicant hurdles as they progress along Main Street.ldquoIt is important people remain patient during the latest aspect of the work in Main Street, he said. ldquoAs this is the main route through the heart of the town, disruption will be inevitable.ldquoThe fact that the work programme has been brought forward is positive given that it will be carried out when the days are longer.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Catholics did not get the vote for another century, and women not for almost another two.In the s only a fraction of men had a vote, and even those who did often lived in boroughs which had so many electors that their vote barely counted, while others lived in ‘rotten boroughs’ where the tiny number of electors ensured disproportionate influence for each vote.But the shape of the current parliamentary system was already in place in the s. There were general elections every few years, and the House of Commons had primacy over the Lords, something it had not had a century earlier until Cromwell shook things up.One thing has not changed over those centuries, however — the first-past-the-postprinciple, in which the person who gets the most votes represents the constituency at Westminster.This applied in th century elections in which one candidate beat another  votes to , or a st century one, in which four candidates all get ,+ votes, one of whom shades the others to victory . FPTP suits a system in which two political parties are dominant. Generally the ultimate make-up of the House of Commons reflects the way the country has voted overall.In America, where the Democratic and Republican parties still dominate, FPTP works OK.But for decades in the UK it has led to unrepresentative outcomes.Labour and the Conservatives do fine, because there are many places where they poll very well and other areas where they poll very badly. They are almost always guaranteed  or so of the  Commons seats.But parties that poll consistently everywhere, but neither well nor badly anywhere, struggle.Ben Lowry: Road ads in Northern Ireland that seek to shock are less effective than the subtle ads in Great Britain that hint at carnage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"This has long been a problem for Liberals, who often got % or % of the vote but % or % of the seats.The problem has been worsening so that the electoral system is now throwing up massively unjust results. Ukip and the Greens got a combined % share in , five million votes, but only a seat each. In , the Lib Dems got . million votes, almost ten times the DUP’s , votes, but only slightly more seats,  to .You might think these points are obvious. Yet it cannot be that obvious because eight years ago, in , the UK thumpingly rejected reform in a referendum on bringing in a mild form of proportional representationin general elections.I am one of the few people on the political right who supported the Additional Votesystem. There is not enough room in this article to recap on the points we supporters of reform made in , but suffice to say AV, while imperfect, ironed out the worst of the injustices.It also kept the ‘single member’ seat, in which one MP represents one area, like West Belfast or North Antrim. In a true PR system you need multi member constituencies, so that, say, Co Down becomes a single vast seat with four MPs.The intimate link between representative and constituency is lost.Supporters of parties that do well out of FPTP, such as the DUP, tend to support the status quo. But it can work for a party for decades, then destroy it, as it did the Ulster Unionists. For + years they had + MPs until FPTP wiped them out and shut them out of Westminster.PR can lead to permanent coalitions, as mainland Europe shows, but FPTP can cause us to lurch between governments of firm left and right . If we go too far one way, the public corrects the other.Now, in these perilous electoral times which have seen phenomenons such as Trump and Macron sweep aside the established order, we risk disastrous outcomes.If you are a Corbyn fan or a Brexit purist, you might welcome the prospect of a general election in which the movement that you support sweeps the board.But it will ultimately be hugely damaging for parliamentary democracywe do not get election outcomes that broadly reflect the ying ways that people express themselves at the ballot box.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorBen Lowry: NI road ads that shock are less effective than subtle GB ads opening of Parliament: address by peers to George IIJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Ben Lowry: The first-past-the-post electoral system is producing massively unjust outcomes and needs urgent reformOur reproduced old News Letter report yesterday, from  yeas ago, referred to the king#s opening of Parliament in February of .

I am sure that most Christians, particularly Catholics, are sad when they read about sexual abuse perpetrated by people in holy orders an oxymoron combination,ever there was one. As News Letter readers are aware, the Latin Catholic Church, centred in Rome in Italy, is enormous in number and spread. It is in continuous existence since the death of Jesus Christ, some , years ago. I don’t believe the Catholic Church would have lasted so long without ine intervention. The religion started out with a relatively small number of believers, having their human foibles and weaknesses. For instance, Judas Iscariot and Peter and Paul. However, today, there are about . billion Catholics living on the planet and in excess of , men in holy orders to provide them with religious ministry. It must, a priori, be very dficult, humanly speaking, to manage such a vast and complex world-wide organisation clearly, from time to time,not all the time, serious spring cleaning from top to bottom is necessary. The summit is, one hopes, such a cauterisation.I will conclude by comparing the measured approach, referred to above, taken by the News Letter today and a Dublin newspaper. The Dublin newspaper has a sensational headline, “Priest forced woman to have abortions.” Coming from this Dublin newspaper, this is hypocritical the same newspaper, in my opinion, looks favourably on abortion provision.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children.

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.PSNI warn of children staggering about drunk or choking on their own vomit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program.

Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds.

She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions.
