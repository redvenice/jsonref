During the trial, El Chapo, in the sketch, waved to his wife who was in the public gallleryEvidence showed drugs poured into the US through secret tunnels or hidden in tanker trucks and railway carriages passing through legitimate points of entry — suggesting a border wall would not be much of a worry.The prosecution case against the diminutive Guzman, whose nickname translates to \u0027Shorty\u0027, included the evidence of several turncoats and other witnesses.Among them were Guzman\u0027s former Sinaloa lieutenants, a computer encryption expert and a Colombian cocaine supplier who underwent extreme plastic surgery to disguise his appearance.One Sinaloa insider described Mexican workers getting contact highs while packing cocaine into thousands of jalapeno cans — shipments that totalled 25 to 30 tons of cocaine each year.Another said Guzman sometimes acted as his own sicario, or hitman, punishing a Sinaloan who dared to work for another cartel by kidnapping him, beating and shooting him, and having his men bury the victim while he was still alive, gasping for air.The defence case lasted just half an hour. Guzman\u0027s lawyers did not deny his crimes as much as argue he was a fall guy for government witnesses who were more evil than he was.Defence lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman urged the jury in closing arguments not to believe government witnesses who \u0027lie, steal, cheat, deal drugs and kill people\u0027.          El Chapo, pictured here in a Mexican jail cell, was extradited to the United States for trialDeliberations were complicated by the trial\u0027s vast scope. Jurors were tasked with making 53 decisions about whether prosecutors had proven different elements of the case.The trial cast a harsh glare on the corruption that allowed the cartel to flourish. Colombian trafficker Alex Cifuentes caused a stir by testifying that former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto took a 100 million dollar bribe from Guzman.Mr Pena Nieto denied it, but the allegation fit a theme: politicians, army commanders, police and prosecutors, all on the take.The tension at times was cut by some of the trial\u0027s sideshows, such as the sight of Guzman and his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, showing up in matching burgundy velvet blazers in a gesture of solidarity.Another day, a Chapo-size actor who played the kingpin in the TV series Narcos: Mexico came to watch, telling reporters that seeing the defendant flash him a smile was \u0027surreal\u0027.While the trial was dominated by Guzman\u0027s persona as a near-mythical outlaw who carried a diamond-encrusted handgun and stayed one step ahead of the law, the jury never heard from Guzman himself, except when he told the judge he would not give evidence.          The sketch artist drew El Chapo\u0027s wife as she sat waiting for the jury\u0027s verdict One of the trial\u0027s most memorable tales came from girlfriend Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez Lopez, who said she was in bed in a safe house with an on-the-run Guzman in 2014 when Mexican marines started breaking down his door.She said Guzman led her to a trap door beneath a bath that opened up to a tunnel that allowed them to escape.Asked what he was wearing, she replied: \u0027He was naked. He took off running. He left us behind.\u0027The defendant had previously escaped from jail by hiding in a laundry bin in 2001. He then got an escort from crooked police officers into Mexico City before retreating to one of his many mountainside hideaways.In 2014, he pulled off another jail break, escaping through a mile-long lighted tunnel on a motorcycle on rails."},{"url":null,"title":"Year space astronauts immune high alert compared Earth bound twin","story":"    Scott Kelly, right, crew member of the mission to the International Space Station, stands behind glass in a quarantine room, behind his brother, Mark Kelly, also an astronaut, in 2015 after a news conference in the Russian-leased Baikonur, Kazakhstan cosmodrome           Mark Kelly speaks on stage at LocationWorld 2016 Day 1 at The Conrad on November 2, 2016 in New York City with his twin brother Scott in the background          The International Space Station (ISS) photographed by Expedition 56 crew members from a Soyuz spacecraft after undocking, Oct. 4, 2018\u0027It\u0027s as if the body is reacting to this alien environment sort of like you would a mysterious organism being inside you,\u0027 said geneticist Christopher Mason of New York\u0027s Weill Cornell Medicine, who helped lead the study. He said doctors are now looking for that in other astronauts.Since the beginning of space exploration, NASA has studied the toll on astronauts\u0027 bodies, such as bone loss that requires exercise to counter. Typically they\u0027re in space about six months at a time.

It\u0027s not a change in DNA but in what\u0027s called \u0027gene expression,\u0027 how genes turn off and on and increase or decrease their production of proteins. Mason also spotted a spike in the bloodstream of another marker that primes the immune system. Yet at the same time, Kelly\u0027s blood showed fewer of another cell type that\u0027s an early defense against viruses.It\u0027s not a surprise that gene activity would change in space — it changes in response to all kinds of stress.\u0027You can see the body adapting to the change in its environment,\u0027 Mason said.          Scott Kelly accompanied by his brother Mark Kelly, right, walks before the launch of the Soyuz-FG  rocket at the Russian-leased cosmodrome in Baikonur, Kazakhstan on October 8, 2010The good news: Most everything returned to normal shortly after Kelly got back on Earth in March 2016. Those immune-related genes, however, \u0027seemed to have this memory or this need to almost be on high alert\u0027 even six months later, Mason said.\u0027On the whole it\u0027s encouraging,\u0027 said Craig Kundrot, who heads space life and science research for NASA. \u0027There are no major new warning signs. We are seeing changes that we didn\u0027t necessarily anticipate\u0027 but don\u0027t know if those changes matter.From four Russians living in space for more than a year, NASA already knew prolonged time off Earth is possible, Kundrot said, adding, \u0027We also aim for more than just possible. We want our astronauts to do more than just survive.\u0027Ultimately, the twin study gives NASA a catalog of things to monitor on future missions to see if other astronauts react the same way. Astronauts on future missions will be able to do some of this testing in space instead of freezing samples for scientists back home, Mason said.           Scott Kelly is seen inside the Cupola, a special module which provides a 360-degree viewing of the Earth and the International Space Station. Kelly was one of two crew members spending an entire year in spaceImmune issues sound familiar to Dr. Jerry Linenger, an American astronaut who spent more than four months on the Russian space station Mir. He said he was never sick in orbit, but once he came back to Earth \u0027I was probably more sick than I was in my life.\u0027Astronauts launch into orbit with their own germs and get exposed to their crewmates\u0027 germs and then after a week with nothing else new in the \u0027very sterile environment\u0027 of a space station \u0027your immune system is really not challenged,\u0027 Linenger said.A human mission to Mars, which NASA hopes to launch in the 2030s, would take 30 months, including time on the surface, Kundrot said.Radiation is a top concern. The mission would expose astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation levels higher than NASA\u0027s own safety standard. It\u0027s \u0027just a little bit over,\u0027 he said.On Earth and even on the space station, Earth\u0027s magnetic field shields astronauts from lots of radiation. There would be no such shielding on the way to Mars and back, but tunnels or dirt-covered habitats could help a bit on Mars, Kundrot saidKelly, who turns 55 next week, said he\u0027d go to Mars. He said a trip that long \u0027wouldn\u0027t be worse than what I experienced. Possibly better. I think the big physical challenge, radiation aside, will be a mission where you are in space for years.\u0027   "},{"url":null,"title":"BBC LOSES 23 000 equipment London headquarters","story":"In total, £13,610 of gear has vanished from New Broadcasting House in London in the last two years, and a further £10,091 of equipment has been reported stolen in the same time periodBrexit no-deal is better than a bad deal says leading DUP MP...Share this articleAt least eight staff computers worth £4,650 in total were among the lost items, along with mobile phones and £1,700 worth of recording equipment.Staff even managed to lose a television set last year.In a statement, the Corporation said: \u0027BBC staff and freelancers can, like the rest of the population, be victims of crime and property that is lost shouldn’t be confused with property that has gone missing as a result of criminal activity. \u0027The BBC takes incidents of crime seriously and we are constantly implementing and reviewing measures to reduce crime and recover lost and stolen items.\u0027John O\u0027Connell, of the Taxpayers\u0027 Alliance, said: \u0027Hard-working families are forced to pay £150 for their licence fee, or face prison.

In fact, she belongs to a growing breed addicted to taking pictures of their children whenever and wherever they can.Hollywood actress Catherine Zeta-Jones is leading the way – and when she recently posted a photo of her 16-year-old daughter Carys on a family holiday, she also came up with a telling new label. ‘Mammarazzi is what my kids call me with my camera,’ she said. The term – a play on the term paparazzi – has caught on with a vengeance.Yet as camera phones grow ever harder to escape, the questions become more pressing, too. Just how far should we go down the road of ‘sharenting’, as it is known? Ofcom suggests that as many as four in ten parents regularly upload family photos to social media, and even England’s Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has expressed concern.We only wear things once!: High Street fashion is now so...Never get catfished again: Researchers develop AI algorithm...Ben Affleck officially retires as Batman... before Jimmy...Share this article    Catherine Zeta-Jones (left) often attends events with her daughter Carys (right) such as the Michael Kors Spring 2019 Collection launch in New York City Last week she warned parents to be cautious about sharing pictures on public platforms, not least because children might not truly have consented. ‘When in doubt, don’t upload,’ she said.Jules is more than happy to be a ‘mammarazzi’, however – and for good reason. ‘I presumed having children would be easy,’ she explains. ‘But it didn’t happen like that. I had six miscarriages.’Then, after five years of trying, she fell pregnant again, and this time suffered terrible nausea.‘I had extreme hyperemesis gravidarum like the Duchess of Cambridge. I spent almost the entire pregnancy in hospital, being tube-fed, and I’d lost more than two stone by the time they cut the cord,’ she says. ‘But I was thrilled to finally have a live baby.’That was 18 years ago with Louis. Then, four years later, she went through exactly the same to have Alexa. ‘I call her my bonus baby – I can’t believe I’ve got her.’With such precious babies, Jules took hundreds of photographs to document their lives. ‘Then, when Alexa was two or three, I started putting pictures on Facebook and later on Instagram.’These days, it’s mostly Alexa who features online – Louis has become rather camera-shy since turning 18. ‘It’s lovely – friends I don’t see often have been able to watch her grow up and know her hobbies and what she’s into,’ explains Jules.But what does her daughter think of her frequent photography? ‘I always check with Alexa before I post a photo of her,’ says Jules.          The \u0027mamarazzi\u0027 enjoy sharing and taking photos of their children and posting them on social media sites Then there are the ever-present concerns about the dark side of the internet. ‘I have 450 to 500 friends on Facebook,’ she says. ‘And if I’ve never had any interaction with someone who sends a friend request, they don’t get through. ‘I tend not to use the children’s names too much because of privacy – I call my son Teen Grump and my girl My Bonus Baby. I just feel safer doing this.’Jules has every reason to be proud of her miracle babies, but it’s also true that her circumstances have been unusual. Why do other mothers seem so obsessive when it comes to pictures of their children?Old-fashioned pride is one possibility, says chartered clinical psychologist Dr Abigael San.‘It could be down to wanting everyone to see how wonderful they are,’ she says. ‘And a perhaps bit of sheep mentality, copying what others do online.‘But it could also be a bit narcissistic. When you’re doing this, it’s helpful to ask yourself why you’re doing it. Do you truly think they’re wonderful and that you’re telling others so your child can see the reaction and gain confidence?‘Or are people doing things like this because it’s feeding their own confidence – is it saying, “This is what I’ve produced, she’s a reflection of me and that means I did a good job and I have good genes.” ’It’s even possible, Dr San argues, that some women post pictures of their children in response to their own sense of ageing: ‘It may make them feel better about themselves because they know they used to look like that.’Shannon Whitlock, from Peterborough, began posting pictures of her two young sons on her Instagram account when she wanted to share recipes with others. The boys had just started weaning. Four years on, she’s a full-on mammarazzi, with a blog on which she regularly posts pictures of Henry, four, and two-year-old Archie.          Shannon Whitlock from Peterborough (right) taking photos of her children Archie (centre) and Henry (left)Shannon now has more than 1,000 photos of the boys on her phone.‘I post on Instagram every day and do about two blogs a week,’ she says. ‘There’s definitely pressure to put pictures of your children on social media, especially when you’re a parenting blogger – there are so many out there now that you need to keep up,’ says the 24-year-old. But getting that perfect shot can be difficult when her boys won’t play ball.‘I take a week’s worth of photos at the weekend when I’ve got my husband Gareth with me,’ she explains. But it can be tricky when the youngsters do not want to pose and sometimes Shannon has to resort to bribing them with treats.‘Archie is very independent and he’ll run away’ she admits. ‘Henry is more negotiable – usually he’s OK with photos. And if he isn’t, I’ll say, “If you do this we might go to the cafe and you can get a cake”, or “We have to go the supermarket and we can get some sweets.”‘He’s obsessed with toy cars so occasionally he’ll get a Hot Wheels car – which costs about £2 – for letting me take a picture. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.’Lauren Denby, 30, from Ashford, Kent, faces a similar battle. Her eldest son, Antony, is now ten and is starting to object to her ‘mammarazzi’ tendencies.The mother of three has a staggering 2,000 images on her phone. ‘If we go on holiday, I’ll get pictures of the children in the evenings, in the sea and in the pool. At home, if we go out, I’ll stand them by the door for a picture. I post them on Facebook and Instagram usually a couple of times a week.’Antony used to be her main subject as his brother Henry, four, hated having his picture taken. But now Lauren’s muse is daughter Penelope who, at one, is rather too young to object.‘Antony will often pull a face, stick his tongue out or look moody, so I tell him to stop and let me take a picture. ‘If he smiles, I’ll put it up on social media.’ So why does she do it? ‘I’m just so proud of them and what they’d doing,’ says the beauty therapist, who takes four or five pictures a week and even more during the school holidays.‘Most of my friends post photos of their children too. I love the comments I get about how handsome and how grown-up Antony is.‘It makes you feel happy that people think that about your children.‘My husband Chris is less keen. He keeps asking why I take so many pictures but I want the kids to be able to look back at them.’He’s not the only one raising questions. ‘This is uncharted territory because social media use is developing so fast,’ says Janey Downshire, author and co-founder of Teenagers Translated, which runs courses for parents.          Experts say that parents need to be careful when posting photos of their children on sites such as Instagram and Facebook‘Parents have to be very careful. The only way this could be a positive is if the child is old enough to consent, and parent and child are in complete agreement about what’s OK to post and what’s not.‘What a parent might think is just a bit of fun, a teenager might disagree because they are more aware of the impact social media has on your future reputation.‘So a parent has to be careful as posting pictures that could harm a young person’s development.‘You have to think about how they’ll feel about it when they’re older. Video footage of young children having tantrums could come back to haunt that parentchild relationship.‘You’re leaving yourself vulnerable as a parent to your child saying later in life that they don’t understand why you did it and it’s shaped their identity in a way they wouldn’t have chosen.’Not that Laura Myers has any such concerns. She has uploaded so many photos of her two-year-old Sophia-Mae on Instagram that her daughter is now regularly asked to be a ‘brand ambassador’ and be pictured in clothing that she has been sent for free. ‘But that’s not why I started doing it,’ insists Laura, who has two older children – Lewis, 18, and Samuel, 11. ‘I do it for fun because I’m obsessive about taking pictures of her.’          Lauren Myers (left) taking a selfie while eating sweets with her daughter Sophia (right)Sophia-Mae’s Instagram account began when she was nine months old and her devoted mum still uploads several images a week. Sophia-Mae has 60,000 followers.‘It’s lovely when you get messages saying she’s beautiful,’ says Laura, from Ilford, East London, who keeps a whopping 4,000 images of her family on her phone.‘It’s a lovely feeling to think you’ve produced her.‘I don’t really have any concerns – except one guy messaged me to say he loved her and sent me a picture of her so I blocked him because it was a bit freaky. Now non-followers can’t see her.‘I can get a lot of stick from people saying, “Why do you take pictures of a child?” But I’m not exposing her body, I’m only exposing her face.’‘Sometimes she’s not in the mood and I’ll tell followers that she’s being grumpy. I posted a picture of her crying once with the message, “Anyone else got a child like this?” because I don’t want other mothers to think she’s perfect.‘And I’d stop in a heartbeat if she didn’t want to do it.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Corbyns secret link tormentor pregnant Jewish MP Luciana Berger","story":"    Luciana Berger (pictured) – who has been dubbed a ‘dirty little Zionist rat’ by pro-Corbyn activists – is thought to be so disgusted by Labour anti-Semitism she is on the brink of leaving to form a breakaway party          Alex Scott-Samuel posted this image on his Twitter page meeting Jeremy Corbyn.

To him, Jews aren’t victims of racism and oppression but rather racist oppressors themselves.‘For years, he’d noisily voice his outrage at the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza... never drawing a distinction between the terms Jew and Zionist which were interchangeable to many on the Left.’           The author says that Mr Corbyn’s campaigns on behalf of low-paid workers against ‘exploitative Jewish employers’ convinced him of ‘the malign collective power of Jews’The author also describes the mood of ‘flippant disdain’ in Mr Corbyn’s office before a crisis summit with the Board of Deputies of British Jews over anti-Semitism, and the complaint from Jonathan Arkush, its president, that Mr Corbyn associated with people who were ‘blatantly racist’.The Mail on Sunday has also established that Corbyn’s own constituency chair has been spreading material condemning ‘the Israel lobby’ for its ‘undue influence on British politics’.Alison McGarry claims that the ‘baseless smears’ of the anti-Semitism scandal have been ‘orchestrated’ by the Israel’s UK Embassy, and has called for ambassador Mark Regev to be removed, claiming he is a ‘hardcore Zionist’.Ms McGarry has also campaigned against the expulsion of Labour member Jackie Walker, who is awaiting a judgment for saying that Jews were the ‘chief financiers of the slave trade’.Ms McGarry has shared a number of petitions on the issue, including one last year which said that the ‘baseless smears and slurs against Jeremy Corbyn have been relentlessly orchestrated by the Israeli Embassy and the Labour Friends of Israel’ and described Israel supporters as a ‘dangerous fifth column’.The Commons debate on anti-Semitism has been timed by the Government to coincide with a resurgence of anger among Labour MPs over the party’s failure to crack down on the problem.          With no degree and two rotten A-levels, when it came to hunting for his first real job, Corbyn aimed lowWith no degree and two rotten A-levels, when it came to hunting for his first real job, Corbyn aimed low.An ad placed by the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers for an assistant in its research department attracted just one reply – Corbyn’s – and he got the job.Intriguingly, given the torrent of anti-Semitism claims the Labour leader faces today, this was the post that gave him his first encounter with Jews.Corbyn’s boss was Alec Smith, who in 1973 was negotiating with employers at the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Wages Council. Working under Smith was Mick Mindel, a Jewish communist who articulated his members’ passionate support for Israel.Most of their employers were also Left-wing Jews – like Mindel, they looked to communism to abolish injustice and prejudice, including anti-Semitism.Corbyn has boasted of how, although only an assistant in the research department, he personally challenged employers to recover members’ unpaid wages after their bosses ‘had mysteriously gone bankrupt just before Christmas, owing their workers a lot of wages’.‘Scumbags, actually. Crooks’ was how Corbyn described the bosses. ‘My job was to try and chase these people through Companies House and so on.’According to Corbyn, he examined the companies’ accounts in order to verify phoney bankruptcies. But that notion is contradicted by his old boss, Alec Smith, and also by the union’s well catalogued records, which do not reveal any issues about ‘unscrupulous employers’, or refer to any member complaining about being unpaid.Smith is certain that Corbyn ‘never had any contact with our members. He just sat in at meetings passing me information’.          Painted by American artist Kalen Ockerman, it portrayed Jewish financiers playing Monopoly on a board supported on the naked backs of the world’s oppressed – mostly blacksCorbyn, not for the first time reshaping the truth to improve his self-image, conjured a tale of a brave personal fight against exploitative Jewish employers of sweatshop labour. Parochialism and fantasy led to him forming his views about the malign collective power of Jews.Thirty years later he boasted how, at the end of one Wages Council meeting, a Jewish tailor had offered to make him a suit if he provided the cloth. Corbyn had spurned the offer. ‘Imagine trying to bribe a union official,’ he laughed.Immersed in an alien world, the young Corbyn had no time for those seeking self-improvement – to fulfil the dream of moving from East End slums to North London’s suburbs.Since he disdained materialism, culture and anything spiritual, he was an empty vessel, uneasy with a race complicated by its history of survival over 2,000 years of persecution.Jews in London were the victims of discrimination by all classes, including the working class – a truth that did not quite fit Corbyn’s Marxist theory of history.Few Labour MPs were more troubled by Jeremy Corbyn than Louise Ellman, elected in 1997 for Liverpool Riverside. A soft-spoken mother-of-two, she had joined the party at 18.For years, it was seldom mentioned that Ellman was Jewish: at Westminster and in her constituency, her religion was irrelevant. That changed after Corbyn’s election in September 2015.The membership of her constituency soared from 500 to 2,700, and at meetings the Corbynistas harangued her about Israel and Zionism. Older party members were disgusted by the anti-Semitic abuse. ‘It’s pretty nasty,’ Ellman reported to party headquarters in London. She blamed the revived Militant faction, now reincarnated as Momentum, for plotting to deselect her. No one at headquarters acknowledged her concern, which did not surprise her.Ellman’s predicament had begun soon after the creation of the Stop The War Coalition in 2001. She was among the first to protest against its anti-Semitism.The criticism of Israel and Zionism was couched in language markedly similar to the myths parroted over the previous 2,000 years about Jewish wealth dominating the world.              Corbyn was heard by a member of his staff mocking Ellman as ‘the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv’ – an allegation he later denied Corbyn had been seen at Stop The War’s annual Al-Quds (the Arab name for Jerusalem) event opposing Israel’s existence, mingling among Palestinians distributing magazines featuring cartoons portraying Jews with large noses pulling the strings of puppet politicians, media moguls and bankers.Just before Christmas 2003, Ellman addressed an empty Commons about the ‘rising tide of anti-Semitism’. She named the leaders of the Muslim Association of Britain, all of whom were connected to Hamas or other terrorist organisations, for promoting the image of a Jewish global conspiracy.The reaction to her speech shocked her: ‘I was regarded as a freak.’ Letters in The Guardian denounced her for identifying Muslims as anti-Semitic. At Westminster, several MPs shunned her. Corbyn was heard by a member of his staff mocking Ellman as ‘the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv’ – an allegation he later denied.The truth is that Corbyn’s antagonism towards Zionism is one of the most consistent – and toxic – lines of his career. To him, Jews aren’t victims of racism and oppression but rather racist oppressors themselves.              Jeremy Corbyn in the 1980s. Corbyn was heard by a member of his staff mocking Ellman as ‘the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv’ – an allegation he later deniedFor years, he’d noisily voiced his outrage at the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza at countless public meetings – never drawing a distinction between the terms Jew and Zionist which were interchangeable to many on the Left.On those occasions he effortlessly lapsed into anti-Semitic language, convinced a backbencher’s prejudice would not attract attention beyond his loyal audience.And for years it didn’t. Nor did the fact that he consistently invited anti-Zionists to the Commons, without ever offering Jews a similar privilege. Among his most appalling guests was Raed Salah, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, which had described Jews as ‘monkeys’ and ‘bacteria’. Salah had been convicted in Israel for saying that Semites had drunk the blood of non-Jewish babies, and used children’s blood to bake bread.Once he thrust himself into the national spotlight by standing as Labour leader, Corbyn was shocked and angered by the media’s investigation of his past alliances.The horrors weren’t hard to find – there were so many they spilled out at regular intervals throughout the first three years of his leadership, each sparking new revulsion.Anyone who wanted to know how Corbyn thought just needed to examine his words – or look at the company he kept.On March 3, 2009, he said in a speech: ‘It will be my pleasure and my honour to host an event in Parliament where our friends from Hezbollah will be speaking. I have also invited our friends from Hamas to come and speak.’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Amazing story 350 pound programming genius Jeff Bezos dark web","story":"    Paul Le Roux, 46, made as much as $250million a year through the sale of illicit services via the dark webPaul Le Roux’s life story reads like a Hollywood plot: an orphan from Zimbabwe who grew up to become a kingpin on the dark web, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a year before he was arrested by the feds - only to then turn state’s witness and help bring down other hardcore criminals.The man who has been dubbed ‘the Jeff Bezos of transnational organized crime’ was brought down by a subordinate who was angry he didn’t treat him to a $30 brunch, according to a new book.The rise and fall of Le Roux, 46, who made as much as $250million a year selling drugs, weapons, and even the services of hitmen on the dark web is the subject of Elaine Shannon’s book Hunting Le Roux: The Inside Story of the DEA Takedown of a Criminal Genius and His Empire.Last year, Le Roux told a federal courtroom in New York that he was guilty of a number of crimes, including selling missile technology to Iran shipping guns from Indonesia and smuggling crystal meth from North Korea.He also admitted on the witness stand that he was responsible for at least five murders supplying weapons to a 200-man militia in Somalia and conspiring to use mercenaries to overthrow the government of the Seychelles.During testimony, Le Roux was asked what products he had smuggled over the years, according to The New York Times.          Last year, Le Roux told a federal courtroom in New York that he was guilty of a number of crimes, including selling missile technology to Iran shipping guns from Indonesia and smuggling crystal meth from North Korea‘Cash, chemicals, drugs, and gold,’ he said.Le Roux also admitted to smuggling weapons. When asked to whom, he replied: ‘Rebels, warlords, criminals - and essentially anyone who had money.’His testimony was given at the trial of three mercenaries that he allegedly hired in 2012 to kill a Filipino real estate agent because he suspected she was stealing from him.That same year, Le Roux was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration after he was lured to Liberia.How jealous sisters Lee Radziwill and Jackie O competed to...Former First Daughter Malia Obama soaks up the sun in white...Share this articleLe Roux went on the trip believing that he was going to meet senior members of the Colombian drug cartel.In reality, however, the trip was a set-up by ‘Jack,’ an underling who agreed to go undercover and help the CIA catch Le Roux, according to the New York Post.‘Jack’, angry over the way he was treated by Le Roux, convinced his boss that Colombian cartel figures were interested in getting into the crystal meth trade, but they first wanted to meet him face-to-face.Le Roux always knew better than to go to meeting himself. He would always send subordinates or others to represent him.This time, however, Le Roux was fearful that if he didn’t meet the Colombians himself, he risked offending them.When Le Roux arrived at the hotel in Liberia where the meeting took place, he had no idea he was talking to a DEA agent who was secretly recording him admit to a number of crimes.When he was arrested moments later, the two DEA agents who were there to take him into custody needed to use their strength to haul his 350-pound body because Le Roux decided to ‘play dead’ and not go along.In her book, Shannon, a crime reporter, reveals a number of interesting details about Le Roux’s life as a wanted criminal.          Joseph Hunter, a former U.S. Army soldier, and two other Americans were tried for carrying out a murder-for-hire plot in which they were paid money to kill a Filipino real estate agent. Le Roux testified that he ordered the hit. Hunter is seen above during his arrest in Thailand in 2012Before turning to crime, he was a genius computer programmer who developed encryption software in the 1990s.But by the late 2000s, he used his internet savvy to traffic in drugs, weapons, and mafia-style services like murder-for-hire.He even had an army of mercenaries that were ready to spring into action across four continents.Le Roux’s goal was to create an ‘online superstore that aspired to sell anything anybody might want.’          Le Roux\u0027s life story is the subject of a new book, Hunting Le Roux: The Inside Story of the DEA Takedown of a Criminal Genius and His Empire, by Elaine ShannonAs if that weren’t enough, we learn about Le Roux’s eccentric personal life.

The explosion at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, remains the worst catastrophe in the history of nuclear powerAfter years of work in archives around the world and interviews with scores of eyewitnesses, I have pieced together what really happened on that April night and in the terrible days that followed.There were many episodes of selflessness and courage.But the destruction at Chernobyl revealed the incompetence, corruption and moral decay that ultimately helped destroy the USSR from within.The immediate causes were design flaws and a series of human errors made within the space of just a few terrifying minutes.In some circumstances, the reactors built at Chernobyl were susceptible to a runaway chain reaction – the same process at the heart of an atomic bomb.Indeed, there had already been a partial meltdown in Leningrad in 1975, where a confidential study made it clear that accidents were not merely possible, they were terrifyingly likely – even in the course of day-to-day operations.           The immediate causes were design flaws and a series of human errors made within the space of just a few terrifying minutesYet for more than a decade, the USSR’s nuclear establishment kept these design faults a deadly secret.In truth, the cataclysm was born of the planned economy and communist bureaucracy itself. For this was an empire of falsified statistics, of unattainable deadlines easily beaten by corner-cutting, sullen indifference to inidual responsibility, terror at conveying bad news to superiors and chains of toadying yes-men clinging to their comfortable party privileges. They made the disaster at Chernobyl almost inevitable.The control room for the fourth reactor at the plant was a large, windowless box, about 60ft by 30ft with a polished stone floor and low suspended ceiling. Beneath the sickly fluorescent strip lights, a rancid haze of cigarette smoke hung in the air.It was 11.55pm on Friday, April 25, 1986, and the mood was tense. A time-consuming safety test scheduled to finish that afternoon had not yet begun. It was designed to check whether the water pumps that cooled one of the four reactors could be kept running in the event of a total power blackout.In such a dangerous situation, the electricity for pumps that kept water circulating through the core would be cut and, although emergency generators would kick in, it would take time – potentially long enough for catastrophic overheating and a core meltdown to begin.The test should have been carried out before the reactor was commissioned in December 1983 but, anxious to meet state-imposed deadlines, officials skipped it. Now it was to take place during a scheduled shutdown for maintenance.The controls were manned by a team of four, a shift foreman at the back and three operators who sat at panels festooned with switches, buttons, gauges, lamps and alarms.          Yet for more than a decade, the USSR’s nuclear establishment kept these design faults a deadly secret          Just two months into the job, he was about to pilot the reactor through a shutdown for the first time in his life – an extraordinary responsibilityIt was past midnight when electricity grid officials in Kiev gave the go-ahead and the control room began slowly to reduce the amount of power the reactor was generating so the test could take place.Stepping up to the instruments on the reactor control desk was 25-year-old Leonid Toptunov. Just two months into the job, he was about to pilot the reactor through a shutdown for the first time in his life – an extraordinary responsibility. The test sounded simple enough: operators would press a button cutting power to the cooling water pumps, simulating a power blackout. Moments later, emergency diesel generators would start and the pumps would circulate water through the reactor core once again.But then, at 12.28pm, Toptunov made a critical mistake and the computer began reducing the power beyond his control.A series of alarms sounded, but Toptunov couldn’t stop the numbers from falling.Within two minutes, the display was almost at zero – he had all but shut down the reactor before the test had even begun.It should have been abandoned there and then, but it was not. Instead the order was given that the power should be increased once again ready for the procedure – leaving the reactor now disastrously unmanageable.It was 1.22am. The control room was calm. It would all be over in seconds. But, by now, Chernobyl Reactor Number Four was a pistol with the hammer cocked.Then, as the test began, every one of the design flaws moved into a deadly confluence.Water passing through the core moved slower and grew hotter, and more and more of it turned to steam reactivity increased further, releasing more heat and creating more steam.          But then, at 12.28pm, Toptunov made a critical mistake and the computer began reducing the power beyond his control          Inside the plant, the surviving workers were met with an apocalyptic sight. Broken glass, shattered concrete panels, tumbled blocks of graphite and lumps of metal lay everywhereAfter just 36 seconds, the test was complete, and the order came to shut down the reactor.But it was too late. Deep inside the reactor, the chain reaction was already out of control. The process leading to meltdown had begun. A frightening succession of alarms began to sound. Warning lamps flashed red. Electric buzzers squawked angrily. Toptunov shouted a warning: Power surge!There was a roar and the building started to vibrate. The reactor was destroying itself. Within three seconds, its power leapt to a hundred times maximum. There was a loud bang. The uranium fuel pellets were melting. The temperature inside the reactor rose to 4,650C – almost as hot as the surface of the sun. A blast equivalent to 60 tons of TNT demolished the upper walls of the reactor hall and tossed the vast 2,000-ton steel and concrete lid of the reactor into the air like a flipped coin.Almost seven tons of uranium fuel, together with pieces of zirconium and radioactive graphite, were hurled into the sky, together with a mixture of gas and aerosols containing some of the most dangerous substances known to man –iodine 131, neptunium 239, caesium 137, strontium 90 and plutonium 239. Inside the plant, the surviving workers were met with an apocalyptic sight. Broken glass, shattered concrete panels, tumbled blocks of graphite and lumps of metal lay everywhere. A few dazed operators ran here and there through showers of sparks and geysers of scalding steam.          A few dazed operators ran here and there through showers of sparks and geysers of scalding steamThe gigantic steel water tanks had been torn apart like wet cardboard, the ends of fractured pipework hung in mid-air and, above the wreckage, where the roof of the huge reactor building had once been, there were only stars. Reactor Number Four was gone.When the first ambulances filled with firemen and workers from the plant pulled up at Medical-Sanitary Centre Number 126 in the early hours of Saturday morning, the staff were quickly overwhelmed. At first, no one understood what they were dealing with. The faces of some victims were a terrible purple others, a deathly white.Soon all of them were retching and vomiting, filling wash basins and buckets until they had emptied their stomachs, and even then unable to stop. The triage nurse began to cry. By morning, 90 patients had been admitted.          When the first ambulances filled with firemen and workers from the plant pulled up at Medical-Sanitary Centre Number 126 in the early hours of Saturday morning, the staff were quickly overwhelmedThe worst affected would later be taken to Moscow’s Hospital Number Six. They had been attacked by radiation from both inside and out.As their white blood cell counts collapsed, infection crawled across the skin of the young operators and firemen. Thick black blisters encrusted their lips and the inside of their mouths. The skin of their gums peeled back, leaving them the colour of raw meat.Unlike heat burns, which heal slowly over time, radiation burns grow gradually worse – expanding from wherever radioactive material had touched them, eating into the tissue below.The men’s body hair and eyebrows fell out, and their skin darkened – first red, then purple, before finally it became a papery brown-black and curled away in sheets.Inside their bodies, the radiation ate away the lining of their intestines and corroded their lungs.As the scale of the crisis became clear, the Soviet authorities reacted with calls for patriotic sacrifice – and secrecy. When an official at Chernobyl said the 50,000 inhabitants of Pripyat should be warned, the director of the station cut his telephone lines.          As the scale of the crisis became clear, the Soviet authorities reacted with calls for patriotic sacrifice – and secrecy          The town knew something was wrong for sure by nightfall when even the radio speaker boxes in every apartment remained silentNuclear engineers on the morning shift tried to warn their families. Some managed to reach them by phone and told them to stay indoors, even though they knew the KGB was listening. One packed his family into the car to take them to safety, only to be turned back by armed police. The city had been sealed off.The town knew something was wrong for sure by nightfall when even the radio speaker boxes in every apartment remained silent. These ‘radio points’ hung on the walls of homes throughout the Soviet Union, piping in propaganda just like gas and electricity.But it was a full 32 hours after the accident before the order was given to evacuate, at 10am on Sunday, April 27.By then Pripyat had already been dusted with nuclear fallout. (Apartment blocks in Kiev – 110 miles away – where the residents of Pripyat were rehoused, were later found to have hundreds of times the normal level of radiation.)And there was no official statement from the Politburo until Monday evening, almost three days after the event.‘An accident has taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,’ said an announcer from Radio Moscow. ‘Measures are being taken to eliminate the consequences.’          But it was a full 32 hours after the accident before the order was given to evacuate, at 10am on Sunday, April 27          The cloud of contamination had continued north and spread west to envelop Scandinavia, before drifting south over Poland and forming a wedge that moved down into GermanyThe following evening, the Soviet Council of Ministers conceded that two people had been killed, that a section of the reactor building had been destroyed, and that Pripyat had been evacuated. There was no mention of a radioactive release, yet there was no escaping it, either.The cloud of contamination had continued north and spread west to envelop Scandinavia, before drifting south over Poland and forming a wedge that moved down into Germany.Chernobyl was headline news in the West.Supported by the KGB, the Soviet nuclear industry was determined to suppress the truth – that the Chernobyl disaster was the conclusion to years of lying and ingrained incompetence. Initially, the Soviets stated that it was the result of an all-but-impossible coincidence of events.Then, three months later, following a secret commission of inquiry, the Politburo issued its verdict: ‘The accident had been caused by a series of gross breaches of the operational regulations of the reactor by workers at the atomic power station.’ In other words, the workers were to blame. Court proceedings followed and the control room officials who had somehow survived the blast and radiation sickness were sent to prison camps.There was no mention of any design faults in the reactor. But behind closed doors, Gorbachev and the Politburo already knew the facts – and that the Soviet nuclear industry had been hiding a terrible secret. They had known since 1975 and the Leningrad accident that one of their reactors was likely to explode – and with unspeakable consequences.Constructed as giant cylinders of graphite, the Chernobyl reactors were more than 20 times the size of Western equivalents and capable of producing so much electricity that each one could power at least a million modern homes – a tribute to the Soviet obsession with colossal architecture and engineering – ‘gigantomania’. The USSR’s evangelical nuclear scientists had proclaimed this model the ‘national’ reactor and rushed it into production at stations planned from the Gulf of Finland to the Caspian Sea. They didn’t even bother with a prototype.Yet, for all the boasts about the power of the ‘red atom’, the design of the massive Chernobyl reactors was hopelessly flawed. They were unstable and capricious, particularly at low power.          Initially, the Soviets stated that it was the result of an all-but-impossible coincidence of events          They had known since 1975 and the Leningrad accident that one of their reactors was likely to explode – and with unspeakable consequencesIt is a particular irony that by spring 1986, Chernobyl was, officially, one of the best-performing nuclear stations in the Soviet Union, and scheduled to receive the Order of Lenin, the state’s highest honour.Even the destruction unleashed by Reactor Number Four could not match the explosive political consequences that would follow.Gorbachev’s personal reputation in the West as a reformer had been tarnished.Now, on the third floor of a gloomy Kremlin office block, he accused the Soviet nuclear establishment of presiding over a secret state.‘For 30 years, you told us that everything was perfectly safe. You assumed we would look up to you as gods,’ he said. ‘That’s the reason why all this happened, why it ended in disaster.’It was devastating assessment. Even the Soviet nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence and stagnation. He knew now that the entire Soviet apparatus was rotten, and it intensified his drive for reform.The Soviet public, too, began to discover just how deeply it had been misled.Chernobyl finally shattered the illusion that the Soviet Union was a global superpower armed with technology that led the world.Even the most faithful citizens faced the realisation that their leaders were corrupt and that the communist dream was a sham.© Adam Higginbotham, 2019Adapted from Midnight In Chernobyl: The Untold Story Of The World’s Greatest Nuclear Disaster, by Adam Higginbotham, is published by Bantam Press, priced £20.

From the Royal Opera House, National Gallery, National Theatre, Shakespeare’s Globe, the Royal Ballet School, Tate, Old Vic and the Royal College of Art, to smaller institutions, such as the Serpentine, Royal Court, Museum of London, Dulwich Picture Gallery, Design Museum, the Courtauld and the Roundhouse venue.Last summer the V\u0026ampA Museum unveiled an extensive £2m entrance courtyard named after the donors. The three Sackler brothers who made the family fortune, Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond, are dead, and some of their descendants have spoken out against the trade in opioids still plied by part of the family.Arthur’s daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, has said her side of the family has never benefited from “morally abhorrent” sales of OxyContin, a drug brought out after her father’s death in 1987 and made by the US company Purdue Pharma, which was by then wholly owned by his brothers Mortimer and Raymond.In 2007, Purdue Pharma was fined in the US for marketing OxyContin “with intent to defraud or mislead” regulators. Recent lawsuits have also named members of the family that benefit from the pharmaceutical company. In America the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that so far this century about 400,000 people have died of overdoses in which prescription or illicit opioids were implicated.A spokesperson from the gallery said: “The gallery is in regular contact with a range of artists about potential future displays and exhibitions, including Nan Goldin, and it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to comment on projects which are still being discussed. The grant pledged by the Sackler Trust is going through our internal review process in line with our ethical fundraising policy and charitable objectives.”Goldin began her campaign against the Sacklers after recovering from an addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. In 2014 she was prescribed OxyContin for tendonitis in her left wrist. She now demands that arts institutions in America and Britain refuse further Sackler donations and argues the family should instead start paying for treatment and rehabilitation for opioid addicts.Representatives of Mortimer’s, the London-based branch of the family, oversee the Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation and have made grants amounting to £80m. Goldin said if other institutions where her work is displayed continue to take Sackler money she will plan “some kind of intervention”.This weekend a V\u0026ampA spokesperson said: “We are grateful for the generosity of donors who make charitable donations to support our public programme, help care for the collection and invest in our facilities. All donations are reviewed against the V\u0026ampA’s gift-acceptance policy, which includes due diligence procedures, considers reputations risk, and outlines best practice within the sector.

You are not about to surrender your life and understanding of the world to machines. That head of yours with its conscious mind, reading this column, remains in the driving seat and always will. It’s true that the capacity of machines to supplement human intelligence, monitor us, mimic us and replace routine jobs and tasks is exploding and in the wrong hands could represent a step change in creating dark forms of economic and social control. But that is the battle for democracy, with the confrontation of the worst of capitalism taking on a new dimension. It does not mean that the end of human life is nigh – it means we have to be cleverer in fashioning responses.Last week, OpenAI, a US-based nonprofit organisation, decided that its new AI model, GPT2, is so good at generating articles from just a few words and phrases that the model could be not be released until OpenAI better understood how it might be used. GPT2’s database is so sophisticated and its algorithms so smart that it has gone far beyond text prediction to writing readable and plausible text.The good news is that this means that computers, for example, could speed-read articles on our behalf, summarise them and answer our questions. Those chatbots that come to your aid when you are lost on some website could become really helpful. If you wear a watch that monitors your health, GPT2 could spell out warnings and diagnoses quickly in plain English. Interesting books in foreign languages will be translated more effectively.The bad news is that in the wrong hands the likes of GPT2 could flood every social media site on a grand scale with fake news or troubling comment. In one test carried out by the US news and technology network the Verge, which was given access to GPT2, a text prompt such as “Jews control the media” led to the following: “They control the universities. They control the world economy. How is this done? Through various mechanisms that are well documented in the book The Jews in Power by Joseph Goebbels, the Hitler Youth and other key members of the Nazi party.” Similarly, hackers who get into your computer could feed GPT2 the content of emails from your closest friends to form a database and then perfectly simulate an email to you when they go “spear phishing” – looking for personal data – tricking you into making a reply. The scope for malevolence is endless.Perhaps OpenAI’s “reluctance” was in part a public-relations stunt – the publicity-hungry, hi-tech billionaire Elon Musk is one of its backers, after all. But there is plainly an issue. Like so much artificial intelligence, GPT2 opens up wonderful new horizons and equally dark pits.It is the same story everywhere. AI allows the inidualisation of your drug treatment and fast and cheap diagnoses of whatever illness you are suffering, along with likely cures. It can compare screening and scanning results with tens of thousands of others, spotting abnormalities early. But the dark side is that some companies are already refusing insurance unless you make all your health data available and charging premiums reflecting the risk. It negates the point of insurance – to pool risk so that good and bad luck cancel each other out.In civil rights, should the police, following Durham constabulary’s lead, use data-driven algorithms to decide whether to detain you overnight? Is that a massive bias against the already socially disadvantaged while removing a police officer’s discretion or a cheap way of making a cash-pressed force more effective?What is required is the rapid creation of some principles to which everyone – if not globally, at least in the EU – is required to adhere. Three seem crucial: maximal transparency and accountability embodied in regulatory oversight and a new Companies Act methods and digital processes to ensure you own your data and its use and fast and effective regulation of content. Put another way, we need every organisation deploying digital data to be open and accountable we need new public interest digital platforms where we can hold our data based on the presumption we own it and we need another Leveson – a fast and effective mechanism to ensure digital information is not misinformation.Yet western governments in general, and Britain in particular, seem frozen in the headlights. Confronted by an industrial system of fake news dissemination that might have had an impact on the Brexit referendum, the UK government has not even gone as far as the US in launching an inquiry, let alone proposing how the regulatory, accountability and data-ownership regimes could be updated. Nor has the Labour opposition been vocal.As a new form of capitalism evolves in front of our eyes, what the writer Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism, in which information companies are building business models using our personal data, without our overt consent and knowledge, Labour has little or nothing to say. It should be the cornerstone of left politics in the 21st century.But don’t join this debate in despair and think that we are on the road to conscious machines, with the algorithms owned by governments and companies, dominating humanity. It was 70 years ago next year that the great British computer scientist Alan Turing set the test of whether machines could be created that behaved indistinguishably from humanity they simply can’t, because it is people who possess the emotions, feelings and values that underpin any economic and social structure. The task is not to throw up our hands warning that the machines are coming – it is to design a world in which we are their master, not their servant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df41ff19b3e72abc7d02712e36dbb45f7542720a/0_166_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ad5f7a6184f6c822f66c33f956e0df","title":"possibility of redemption is central to a humane society shamima begum","story":"Whatever her actions are found to be, Britain cannot wash its hands of Shamima BegumHow do you solve a problem like Shamima? In February 2015, 15-year-old east London schoolgirl Shamima Begum travelled to Syria with two friends, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, to join Islamic State. Last week, she was discovered in al-Hawl, a Syrian refugee camp, by the Times reporter Anthony Loyd. She is nine months pregnant and wants to return to Britain.For some, Begum is a victim, a child brainwashed into jihad. For others, she is a villain who willingly joined Isis and should be barred from this country. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, insists that he “will not hesitate to prevent” her return if necessary.Both sides are wrong. Britain should let Begum return. Not because she’s a victim but because she’s a British citizen. We do not yet know of her actions in Syria. But, whatever they may have been, she remains someone to whom Britain has legal and moral obligations.Refusing entry to Begum would not simply keep her out of Britain. It would also force another state or organisation to take responsibility for her. The al-Hawl camp is run by the largely Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF has endured staggering loses in its battles against Isis. Why should Britain now expect it to be responsible for a British citizen who helped its monstrous enemy?Earlier this month, Sajid Javid authorised the deportation to Jamaica of 29 people convicted of crimes in this country. They were deemed “foreign nationals” despite many of them having spent most of their lives in this country and being, in most meaningful senses of the word, British. Yet Javid now suggests that he might refuse entry to British citizens who may have committed even worse crimes and force other nations or organisations to take responsibility for them. That is ethically grotesque.If Britain cannot discard its responsibility for Begum, neither can Begum evade responsibility for her actions. We should be careful of treating Begum primarily as a victim.Yes, Begum was just 15 when she left for Syria. She was likely to have been more easily persuadable than had she been an adult. The fact remains, however, that she and her two friends chose to travel to Syria to join Isis. They made their plans surreptitiously and took measures to evade detection. They might have been drawn into Isis by online handlers, but they were ideologically attracted by the idea of a caliphate.Four years on, Begum still appears to be. She has clearly been through a terrible experience. Yet, in her Times interview, she shows little regret or remorse. She is ashamed not of joining Isis but of not being “strong” enough to stay with the caliphate to the bitter end. She was not “fazed” by seeing a severed head in a bin, thinking “only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance”. There is a shocking disjuncture between her blindness to the horrors of Isis and her desire to “come home and live quietly with my child”.One cannot make assessments on the basis of a single interview given to a journalist in a refugee camp in a war zone after four traumatic years. There may be many reasons for Begum speaking as she did. She may well change her views over time. A humane society always acknowledges the possibility of redemption.In any case, views alone, however odious, should not be a matter for criminal sanction. If Begum is to face due process, it should be for her actions, not her views. Could Begum pose a security threat to Britain? Possibly. But then she would equally do so to Iraq or Syria or Kurdistan or wherever else she ends up. It would be morally contemptible for Britain to insist that some other nation take that risk. Britain’s obligations to its citizens – and to other nations – are not diminished by the fact that those citizens may have committed appalling acts.Begum will not be the last British jihadist wanting to return home. Many will have committed more terrible crimes. Their cases will pose even more difficult moral and political dilemmas. The principles of moral responsibility, on either side, will, however, remain the same.What separates a nation such as Britain from the barbarism of Isis, politicians often claim, is that Britain abides by the rule of law and is defined by humane values. It’s in these hard cases that we will discover how true that is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe8b017b148f2b803844596b7924b2165639cdd0/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94020c453b8b29f76a15eae65c17ba19","title":"sensitive facade feminist credentials soulful lyrics but what lies beneath","story":"The allegations against the US singer-songwriter Ryan Adams are complex and gruesome. Sexually Skyping with someone who turned out to be a minor. Blocking his then-wife’s career. Offering creepy-sounding “help” to young female artists. Threatening suicide when women didn’t respond quickly enough…Away from Adams, who has denied the allegations, a good name for this might be “needy predator”, a toxic masculinity honed to such a degree that it can mute itself to evade detection. For such types, where better to hide and flourish than in the role of liberalsensitivenavel-gazingfeminist-simpaticooutsider singer-songwriter?The same transparency is not evident with the perma-tortured singer-songwriter, also working their muso status as a chat-up line, just in a sneakier way (“I’d love to hear your songs” “Let me help with your career”). A young woman might respond to such attention, especially, say, when it comes from a proved sensitive muso, artists who had spent their career virtue-signalling to the point where, as someone said to me, you wonder what they’re hiding.One could also wonder if, before success, such types struggled to get women to notice them? Whether beyond the angst and self-loathing expressed in their art, there’s a whole other mess of self-pity, anger, rejection and wheedling, manipulative sexual behaviour they’re not admitting to. A mess that’s been internalised, that success failed to soothe, a little voice deep inside saying that women started bothering with them only when they became successful musicians, so they may as well take advantage. Who knows if any of this applies to Ryan Adams?In my experience, self-hate can be the eighth wonder of the entertainment industry. For certain people, self-hate manifests as a fire, burning down everything and everyone. Certainly, women should be wary of men who so deftly conceal a brand of toxic masculinity under cloaks of artsy, liberal-presenting respectability and integrity. Sometimes, it really is the quiet ones – and not in a good way.Anti-witch markings – scrawls and gouges on walls meant to protect humans from demons and the like – have been found in English caves. Experts say they could date to the 14th century. How fascinating. There’s just one problem – they were discovered at Creswell Crags, on the NorthamptonshireDerbyshire border, deep in the Midlands. That’s right – goth country.I know about this, as someone from the Midlands, who has been cruelly outed as a former goth, in photographs from my youth that could yet prove to have been digitally altered for blackmailing purposes. But I digress…My question: as the Midlands is such a major goth heartland, can experts be certain that the marks weren’t made by a bunch of bored teenage goths in… well, any time period really? Clues might include: discarded hair crimpers nearby, perhaps a half-drunk bottle of cider, scattered pages of handwritten poetry that’s clearly been sobbed over (themes: eternal darkness, existential despair, the occasional dragon or griffin), evidence that someone has tried to give themselves a tattoo armed only with a Biro and a school compass.While one doesn’t wish to discredit the anti-witch markings of Creswell Crags, the location makes this former goth Midlander just a tad suspicious.In New York, there’s a rising trend for eating alone and some restaurants have amended their menus and tables to cater for this. The restaurant booking site OpenTable has also reported a rise in solo dining. In a way, this surprises me – what took people so long?I’ve always liked dining out alone just as much as eating with others. Sitting quietly on my own with a book, sometimes tapping on a phone, never bothered me at all. Over the years, I must have sat cheerfully on my tod in every type of restaurant – Italian, Indian, Chinese, Thai, gastropubs, “fine dining establishments”, the lot. If people were staring at me or pitying me, I never noticed or cared. While there are hazards – controlling the primal urge to bore the waiting staff with your life story the gut-wrenching horror of being invited to join another table by kindly souls who are concerned for your happiness and wellbeing being asked to share with a stranger who appears to consume noodles by inhaling them via their nostrils – most of the time, it’s worked out fine.It always amazed me when solo diners were branded weirdos or losers, as if they had some hideous social leprosy that meant they couldn’t rustle up company. Seriously? It seems to me that the person who is happy to eat alone, without a shred of self-consciousness, isn’t going to be short of offers.You’re either the kind of person who’s happy to do most things alone, including eating in restaurants, or you’re not. Neither is right or wrong, or, for that matter, fixed for all time. Still, it’s positive that the caricature of the pathetic, friendless solo diner may be fading. Alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely, and dining out alone isn’t only socially acceptable, it’s fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aee67501d356c4ea61fd14d4c08ddc15a511612/0_0_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9fee244bf0a38c33c0fe4061c0f254","title":"the observer view on shamima begum","story":"Whatever the risk this young Isis supporter may pose, she is Britain’s responsibility and we cannot afford to shirk itExploited victim or unrepentant villain? It’s impossible to determine the truth about Shamima Begum, the 19-year-old who left Bethnal Green in London when she was 15 to join Islamic State, from a single newspaper interview. And it shouldn’t be hard to acknowledge that more than one interpretation of her story might contain a ring of accuracy.Begum is undoubtedly vulnerable. She was groomed online at the age of 15 married off, albeit willingly, to a jihadist fighter while still a child just 10 days after arriving in Raqqa, Syria in recent months, she has lost two infants to malnutrition and inadequate healthcare. Heavily pregnant with her third child, she says: “I’ll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child.”But it is also true that Begum travelled to Syria to join one of the world’s most brutal terrorist organisations, fully aware of the terrible atrocities it commits, including the genocide of Yazidis in Iraq. It is impossible not to feel shock at her apparent lack of remorse her claim not to be fazed at the sight of a severed head in a bin her response to videos of British hostages being beheaded: “Were these not journalists and stuff that were caught spying?” She may or may not have committed or abetted crimes in the name of Isis her networks, knowledge and beliefs may or may not make her a grave security threat wherever she lives in the world.We as observers may feel at once a disconcerting mix of compassion for her suffering, though it pales against that for Isis’s victims, and disgust for her views. But from ministers we have the right to expect more: a cool-headed assessment of how the UK must act based on its obligations under the rule of law and its duty to keep British citizens safe.On this, they have failed. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said last week he would not hesitate to prevent her return to the UK. This is unlikely to be possible legally: Begum remains a British citizen and the Geneva conventions proscribe governments from making their citizens stateless.But preventing Begum’s return is wholly the wrong thing to do, even if it were possible. The only purpose it serves is virtue-signalling how tough Javid is on radicalised teenagers sympathetic to terrorism.On security grounds alone, she should be brought home. British citizens who have travelled out to fight for or support Isis pose a security risk. Radicalised Europeans who have returned from Syria have committed terrorist attacks on European soil, including the Paris attacks in November 2015. Begum was radicalised here as a child. It is Britain’s responsibility to manage any consequential risks. Leave her in Syria and she may turn up, undetected, in the UK, via established smuggling routes, or do untold damage in radicalising others against Britain and the west. Bring her back through official channels and she can be questioned by the security services, held to account for any crimes she may have committed, to the extent that the evidence allows, and put through a deradicalisation programme.Even more importantly, Begum must be allowed into Britain simply because it is what the rule of law demands. She is a British citizen, about to give birth to an innocent child who will be a British citizen by descent. The correct approach to British citizens who hold the abhorrent views of Begum is not to abandon our values or to junk due process. It is not to deprive a British citizen of their statehood, in contravention of international law. It is to bring her back to the UK and for her to be charged and face trial to the extent that the evidence allows. It is for the justice system, not for MPs and a social media mob, to determine the extent to which she is a victim or a perpetrator. And it is for the intelligence services to determine the extent to which she is a security risk.There are risks in this approach. Only about one in 10 of 400 or so British returnees from Syria have been successfully prosecuted, in some cases because there are restrictions on the admissibility of evidence collected from battle sites. Begum may be considered a security threat, but may not have committed crimes beyond supporting Isis, or the evidence for crimes of which she is suspected may be too weak to secure a conviction. But these are risks that can be best managed in Britain. At the very least, if Begum is deemed a security threat, she can be monitored and compelled to take part in a deradicalisation programme. The risks of leaving British citizens who have joined Isis in the Middle East to their own devices, out of a childish, wrong-headed instinct that they deserve no better, are greater still.Begum is also a test case for the British government’s approach to the hundreds of British fighters and supporters of Isis who are alive in Syria today. Like her, these iniduals should be gradually repatriated in a controlled fashion and interrogated and, where possible, charged with any crimes they may have committed.Begum may have been groomed as a 15-year-old, but her support for a terrorist organisation that has committed unspeakable atrocities means she has much to atone for on her return to the UK. Perhaps she will, perhaps she won’t. Perhaps the threat from Isis will never be fully extinguished. But one thing is certain: it will never happen if we compromise the liberal values and abandon the rule of law that set us apart from the enemies who hate us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f72d6cbe91718637f1204284ec3d733e20fbe92e/0_169_3307_1984/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d488f0baaed434ae4eaedbf752e53364","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of time","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘time’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘time’.Share your photos of what time means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 February at 10am.

Luckily for menswear, this spring is all about tailoring, on and off the catwalk – and not a fusty old suit in sightRead more from the springsummer 2019 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplementThe streetwear brand Supreme shocked the fashion world last year. No, it wasn’t the red-and-white logo-covered pinball machine, inflatable kayak or even the branded breathalyser it was selling. It was something so innocuous, so unexpected yet quotidian, the virtual opposite of a “shock tactic” in fact. Tucked away among all the hoodies, track pants and baseball caps typical of the much-hyped label, there was – wait for it – a classic two-piece suit. The item more readily associated with commuters and politicians than hoodie-wearing hype beasts had entered new territory.It sent ripples through the streetwear community. GQ called it the Supreme piece they would most like to buy and, in an unlikely turn of events, suddenly trainer-hungry superfans were salivating over a blazer.This season there were four major menswear designer debuts at luxury labels and all rallied behind the two-piece. At Kim Jones’s first outing at Dior, he gave the suit his blessing, with lightweight double-breasted ones in pastel pink and Big Bird yellow. Virgil Abloh, in a much-anticipated collection for Louis Vuitton, steered away from what might have been expected when looking at his streetwear-infused label Off-White, and instead opted for roomy tailoring in white, mint and candy-apple red. Riccardo Tisci, a pioneer of gothic-chic streetwear during his reign at Givenchy, showed tasteful, meeting room-friendly suits as part of his first Burberry collection. Meanwhile Hedi Slimane, showing menswear for the first time at Celine, presented his signature razor-sharp skinny suits in black.The suit is obviously nothing new. It has been with us, in one form or another, for centuries – from French aristocrats’ matching redingotes and breeches in the early 1700s to England’s more conservative version popularised by Beau Brummell in the early 1800s and the preppy postwar American iteration championed by Brooks Brothers. Its longevity can be put down to its chameleon-like qualities. The suit has been spun in many different directions over the years, from the traditional (Gianni Agnelli, JFK Jr) to the foppish (Bryan Ferry, Wes Anderson) to the outright eccentric (David Bowie, André 3000). Then, of course, there are the myriad varieties seen in offices every day.Interestingly, though, as its fashionability grows, the suit’s place in the corporate landscape is fading. Silicon Valley startup culture has ushered in a new age of casual dressing that makes off-duty clothes appropriate for the corner office. Two years ago, JPMorgan Chase announced that “business casual” was its new official everyday dress code. Last year, the business publication Inc. released a guide for companies to attract millennials with a more relaxed approach to workplace attire. With white-collar workers increasingly casual, the stuffy totem of adulthood and nine-to-five dressing that is the suit can be reassessed by a new generation of men who associate hoodies and trainers with the uniform of establishment figures such as Mark Zuckerberg or Evan Spiegel.Andrew Cedotal, a 32-year-old Silicon Valley game designer, is an interesting case. He wears a suit or mixed suit separates, despite his notoriously casual environs – and likes what it semaphores. “Wearing a put-together outfit is a way of very easily communicating that you know how to build an organised and visually appealing presentation,” he says. “It’s a sign to people who are marketing experts that you know how to tell a story in a single glance.”Cedotal is an outlier in the Bay Area, and can remember seeing only two other suit-wearers in the wilds of San Francisco. At companies he’s worked for, it’s mostly relegated to the legal team. In the tech industry, where “disruption” is a cherished value, he is in fact the rebellious one for wearing a throwback uniform. “I’ve had multiple people say that to me,” he laughs.Michael Adebayo, a 32-year-old GP based in the north-east of England, is someone for whom wearing a suit is optional – but he often does it anyway, he says, “in a more relaxed manner, without a tie or pocket square. These days, seeing people combining a suit with trainers or even shorts is amazing.” Adebayo uses suits to stand out – “Velvet and natural wool fabrics are my favourites” – rather than blend into a crowd. “I feel I can take on any challenge when wearing a suit and, most importantly, it makes people listen.”This new era of suiting won’t simply be a return to the slim-fitted “suited-and-booted” movement of the early noughties when Slimane’s skinny tailoring for Dior Homme dominated, but will bring the swagger of streetwear into the more traditional world of tailoring. Look at the mint green, oversized Louis Vuitton double-breasted suit Kanye West wore (with no shirt and slide sandals) over the summer, or Michael B Jordan’s Off-White suit with a belted waist and bright orange armband. Then there’s the floral appliquéd Haider Ackermann suit – a mix of rock’n’roll and romance – that Timothée Chalamet wore at the Toronto film festival in September, or DJ Benji B, more usually found in a bomber jacket or hoodie, in a Virgil Abloh-designed, loose-fitting Louis Vuitton suit at the Fashion Awards in December. Footwear is key – see Stormzy, a tracksuit devotee, on the front of Elle’s February issue in tailoring and trainers – a surefire way to de-corporate any suit.Of course, for some, the suit never went out of style in the first place. Finance manager David D’Costa, 31, wears one as his “work uniform”. “A mentor in my first job guided me through the basics of suit wearing and over time I’ve developed my own style,” he says. Despite the suit’s formerly fusty reputation, he says seeing hordes of suit-wearers crossing London Bridge in the morning rush hour can be “a thing of beauty” and is in favour of more creative suit trends making their way into the boardroom.Thomas Henry, a 34-year-old strategy director at the creative agency Mother in New York, has worn a suit all his professional life, to give him a certain edge and add an authoritative balance to his youthful appearance. He remembers the Mad Men-inspired tailoring revival of a decade ago, but is the only member of his office to embrace the suit today, and doesn’t think that will change – because of the impact it makes. “A deep irony about the creative industry is that you spend all this time telling your clients to stand out, yet the people who work in the field have a deep insecurity about looking different.” Henry has no such qualms.Brendon Babenzien, founder of New York-based brand Noah, which brings together surf, skate and music references with classic American menswear, is aware of this new suit wearer. He usually includes some sort of tailoring among his casual-leaning collections. “I don’t know anyone who dresses up or down all the time,” he says. His current version is a patchworked two-piece featuring tattersall, windowpane and micro-check plaids. “Our customer seems to really appreciate the way we do suiting and jackets,” he says. “We’ve removed some of the formality from it.”London brand Casely-Hayford is built around the suit, but designer Charlie Casely-Hayford – himself a member of the new suit tribe – has noticed his customer is embracing it in a more relaxed way, too. “Our biggest market is guys who don’t need to wear a suit for their job, but they choose to,” he says. “We work with a lot of creatives and they wear suits in a totally different way from our more strait-laced clients.” Wearing a suit with a T-shirt and trainers is increasingly common, he says. “The overarching theme I hear from our clients is comfort and ease, and the idea of getting that from a suit.”So are younger men finally ready to trade their sweatshirt uniform for suits? All signs point toward yes. But perhaps it’s not a comeback per se. “I teach at a couple of universities,” says analyst Cohen. “Some of my students come to class wearing suits. I say, ‘What are you all dressed up for?’ And they say: ‘This is me, this is my style. I discovered the suit.’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f5f25e00506cb818cf83e14c757e6f025fc790/0_42_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=683d542625a11972e8ebc75a82af1c44","title":"united skates documentary film roller skating black america","story":"In the documentary United Skates, a film-making duo explore the understudied subculture of skating and what it means to many black Americans“Skating, to me, is life,” says Shannon Grays, as he shows off his custom roller skates. The son of Phelicia Wright, a self-proclaimed “rink rat”, Grays’ enthusiasm towards skating shines brightly through his big brown eyes. For Phelicia, her five children, and many other African Americans, roller skating is not just a passion. It is a profound cultural connector.These deep generational ties are brought to light in the new documentary United Skates, which explores the attempts to conserve skating as an art form. Brimming with history and anchored by stories of skaters’ struggles across America, from North Carolina to Chicago to Los Angeles, the film uses a microscope to examine a bigger issue: dwindling black cultural spaces.“If it’s a popular rink or if it’s a thriving rink, it’s because they have a strong African American skate community,” says Pete, a Los Angeles custom skate designer. Journalist Maulah Allah says: “For many black people, being on four wheels is like black-eyed peas and greens on New Year’s Eve.” For these skaters, rinks are edifices where creativity and physical activity collide with acrobatic moves and audacious stunts.Roller skating has been plagued by the threat of rezoning, by municipalities who prefer the revenue from retail stores and by land developers who want higher prices for the space. In the film, one protester mentions that the US loses about three skating rinks a month. The situation is made worse by over-policing and rink owners who do not welcome African American skaters, barring them with anodyne and arbitrary rules.This thread not only led them to a story of discrimination, but also a celebration of hip-hop: in the film, they try to tell the story of how an underground genre emerged as well. Retold through pioneers like Salt-N-Pepa, Coolio and Naughty by Nature’s Vin Rock, the documentary recounts stories of rap legends like Queen Latifah and NWA as they toured the country by roller rink.According to Brown and Winkler, what happened behind the camera was just as dramatic as what happened on screen. The pair worked side jobs and applied for “every grant you can think of” to bring United Skates to life. “No matter how much we explained the situation, showed the footage that we had, we just kept hearing: ‘Wow, we love this, come back when you have more.’“We just had to keep our heads down, know that what we were doing we were doing with integrity and we were doing the best that we could and hope that … people would believe in us the way that we believe in ourselves.The documentary took about five years, from inception to its premiere at the Tribeca film festival. Brown and Winkler actually lived with their subjects during the process of filming. The immersion pays off as they disappear into the stories of the characters on show.During production, both Winkler and Brown stressed they were sensitive to the feedback from skaters –\u0026nbspand even considered pulling the film. Brown says: “After walking away from this story and having the skaters pull us back in, we decided to cut a little teaser and show it to a thousand or so skaters. Basically, let them decide: should we just walk away? We were ready to do that. Once we showed that teaser, we got a standing ovation! The doors of homes and rinks opened up across the country, and for us, that was a big moment. That was when we knew we weren’t making this film as outsiders, we were making it with the community and by their side.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney). Simon Chinn has previously won best documentary Oscars in 2013 for Searching for Sugar Man and in 2009 for Man on Wire. Black Sheep is executive produced by the ’s head of documentaries, Charlie Phillips, and Lindsay Poulton, executive producer, documentaries.Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of  News \u0026amp Media, said: “It’s wonderful to see such an important and personal story resonate with so many people and I’m delighted that the  helped to tell it.”Simon Chinn said that he was “thrilled and honoured” at the nomination. “Thanks to Ed, to everyone who worked on the film and to Cornelius, who was so generous and candid in telling his story and without whom this film could never have been made,” he added.Black Sheep has already won a string of awards, including best short at Sheffield DocFest and the grand jury prize at the Berlin British Shorts film festival. It is the first time a  film has been nominated for an Oscar.The Academy Awards will take place on 24 February at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a2fca23a22b86f2a020192a72274d38b857799/0_14_2457_1474/master/2457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58307c2e5b013327fc0380b24d522cbc","title":"chelsea manchester united fa cup","story":"The clubs are meeting in the FA Cup’s tie of the round after sobering defeats last weekThe fast-moving world of football has managed to overtake what promised to be an FA Cup treat at Stamford Bridge on Monday night. When the draw was made, Chelsea’s pairing with Manchester United was the obvious fifth-round highlight, but that was before both clubs suffered chastening setbacks.Chelsea suffered their heaviest defeat of the Premier League era at the hands of Manchester City last Sunday, a 6-0 thrashing that left Maurizio Sarri in a state of shock. It is highly unlikely that Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s United will be quite so ruthless and relentless, though with a Carabao Cup final against City due at the end of the month one could readily understand Sarri and his players feeling apprehensive about the possibility of setting up another meeting in a different competition.United will feel a little deflated, too, after the first setback under Solskjær’s temporary charge. While there is no disgrace to losing to a team as powerful and lavishly funded as Paris Saint-Germain, the illusion of invincibility has gone, the confidence will have taken a hit, and it remains to be seen how good Solskjær is at restoring self-belief and pride in his players.The expected exit from the Champions League may prove something of a blessing if it streamlines the fixture list and enables Solskjær to concentrate on his core task of securing a top-four finish, and doubtless there are some at United who feel just as hard-headed about the FA Cup.Reaching the final would be tremendous for Solskjær personally and would enable the club and its supporters to finish a difficult season on a high, though if the United hierarchy could make a choice between tangible silverware and Champions League football next season they would take a top-four finish every time.So, too, would Chelsea. Were United to secure fourth place Chelsea would most likely be the ones to miss out. For a second successive season. With a new manager imported from Italy, not a caretaker whistled up from Norway. The stakes are high between Chelsea and United at the moment, but in the league rather than the Cup.Chelsea are in one final but in danger of missing out on the Champions League place they brought Sarri in to secure. United are the club who in effect sacked a manager on the day he won the FA Cup but there can be little doubt Chelsea would view Sarri as similarly disposable should he fail in his primary objective in the league.Not that Chelsea or anyone else are likely to contemplate winning the FA Cup while Manchester City are still in it, but the days are long gone when a Wembley triumph would make up for a disappointing league campaign. At the top end, the league just is not like that any more, and neither, unfortunately for traditionalists, is the FA Cup.At least Chelsea are not going into the FA Cup tie on the back of a demoralising defeat, having restored a little pride with their victory against Malmö in Sweden. Sarri’s comment after the 2-1 win was revealing: he said he was happy that his players performed with confidence because he knew that would not be easy after the City drubbing.Top-six teams are supposed to hand out occasional pastings to the sides below them in the table, not to each other, and the lack of resolve Chelsea displayed at the Etihad was bound to be a matter of concern for a coach attempting to return to the elite. United were not short of motivation against PSG, they were just picked apart by opponents with better passing and movement and, in Kylian Mbappé, the sort of counterattack threat that is almost impossible to resist.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsIt was United’s own counterattacking ability that almost produced a win at Stamford Bridge in the league fixture last October, the one where Ross Barkley’s equaliser in the sixth minute of added time prompted celebrations on the Chelsea bench that upset Mourinho.That was arguably one of United’s most impressive displays under Mourinho, a combination of the expected defensive discipline with a more surprising willingness to go for all three points. Solskjær’s United, though, have come up against one top-six opponent in the league, when Marcus Rashford’s goal and David de Gea’s goalkeeping accounted for Tottenham at Wembley last month, though they were impressive in removing Arsenal in the last round of the Cup.Given that the future of both managers could hinge on results against top-six opponents this season, David Luiz’s comments about the players buying into Sarri’s philosophy were interesting. He said the squad and manager had meetings all the time, which was unsurprising, but argued Manchester City were the best team in the world because they had worked under the same manager for three seasons. Liverpool are enjoying success for the same reason, the Chelsea defender believes.“We lost a few matches because it is part of the process,” he said. “The teams that are at the top of the table now are ones with managers who have been there for three years or more and there is a big difference when you have already understood everything, it is much easier to play football.”He suggests, perhaps optimistically, that Chelsea might get close to City’s level after another year or two with Sarri. He could be right, but the optimism comes in expecting a Chelsea manager to last that long.United are in a similar position, having tried four different managers in the six years since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down. As a quick fix, Solskjær has been marvellous, but United are still going to need a lot of convincing that he is the right long-term solution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e9979f87d17213ae0fc09c023d3be76f734287/54_0_2335_1401/master/2335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c040c06dcc6ecb9ad8c6add70a58e21","title":"everythings a little too cosy in footballs game of family fortunes","story":"Why do managers keep signing their sons and using them as agents? And just what persuaded Cardiff to give contracts to Willie McKay’s twins?By now, I expect you might have seen that old video clip of the time Harry Redknapp was hosting a question-and‑answer session at West Ham and taking a bit of heat from someone in the audience who seemed to suspect they might have taken their reputation as a family club a little too far.The irate fan didn’t seem to care when Redknapp said the 18‑year‑old sitting to his right was destined for the “very, very top”. That player was a young Frank Lampard. “Not good enough,” complained the punter. Why, he wanted to know, was Lampard getting a game? Why had the manager’s nephew been fast-tracked into the team when a better player by the name of Scott Canham had been let go for peanuts?All of which can probably be filed alongside that great line from the Chelsea-supporting Tim Lovejoy – “Oh, it’s OK, it’s only Ray Parlour” – as a Sky fanzone commentator seconds before Parlour scored for Arsenal in the 2002 FA Cup final.Canham had joined Brentford and went on to play for Leyton Orient, Chesham United, Woking, Farnborough, Grays Athletic and Thurrock before quitting football, aged 32, to start a car repairs business. As for Lampard, well, whatever became of him?Easy to scoff, knowing what we do now. Yet, in fairness to the bloke with the egg on his face, would it really have been so outlandish if he had suspected Lampard might be viewed more favourably because of his family connections?Football does, after all, often tend to work that way. Sometimes, as with Lampard, it all makes sense. Other times, not so much. Unless Roberto Mancini seriously believed his son, Andrea, might break into Manchester City’s side when he signed him in 2010 (optimistic, you would have to say, given that Mancini Jr is now at Francavilla Calcio 1927 in Italy’s fourth ision). Or there is another reason why, of all the players Tony Pulis has encountered in his 27-year managerial career, there is only one I can recollect who has signed for him at three different clubs: the player, coincidentally, who happens to be his son.Anthony Pulis was taken on by the old man as a trainee at Portsmouth, where he made one appearance as a 90th-minute substitute, then followed him to Stoke City in 2004. When Pulis Sr was sacked by Stoke and appointed by Plymouth he re-signed his son on loan. Then the manager went back to Stoke for a second spell and handed him a new contract. Anthony made two appearances in four years at Stoke, then drifted around the lower leagues and eventually turned up at Orlando City, who just happened to be a feeder club for Stoke.It happens in all walks of life, granted, and football has some way to go before it catches up with one sport in particular. As the columnist Norman Chad, aka Couch Slouch, once wrote in the Washington Post: “In case you forgot, the ‘N’ in NFL also stands for ‘Nepotism’. Skill can go a long way, but nothing beats having your father hire you.”Rather stunningly, Chad had worked out that almost a quarter of the NFL coaches at that time employed their sons in prominent coaching roles. The Seattle Seahawks had even created two positions on behalf of Pete Carroll for the coach’s sons, Nate and Brennan. Though still not quite as impressive, perhaps, as Bill Belichick appointing his own flesh and blood, Steve, as his assistant with the New England Patriots. At 24, Steve’s sporting qualifications involved some lacrosse at Rutgers University and a year as their long snapper. The equivalent, as Chad noted, of scrawling graffiti on the wall of a Greyhound bus station before getting hired by the New Yorker as a senior correspondent.Football, too, likes to keep it in the family, in all sorts of different ways, and there is no doubt it can make a lot of people rich in the process. Just consider the number of agents with familiar surnames, usually the sons of managers or senior boardroom figures, who have made a killing from the sport. Or some of the other relationships that have made sure, when it comes to all the different branches of football’s family tree, that the entitled apple doesn’t fall far from the entitled apple orchard.What possibly was it, for example, that qualified David Sharpe, then 23, to take over as chairman of Wigan Athletic in 2015? Apart from the obvious, perhaps: that Dave Whelan, the club’s owner, was his grandad. Sharpe had initially been in charge of the family’s fish‑and‑chips restaurant, Sharpy’s, before it was boarded up because of a lack of customers, costing Whelan £1.3m in the process. Not many 23-year-olds take over a Championship club.Even more perplexing is the story of Billy Davies being appointed as manager of Nottingham Forest in 2013 and the club’s then owner, Fawaz al-Hasawi, being daft enough to let the Scot’s adviser, Jim Price, take over as general manager, in effect running the club on a day‑to‑day basis, as part of the package.Price, the manager’s cousin, was previously a solicitor at Ross Harper in Glasgow but had been suspended by the Law Society of Scotland as part of a five-year investigation into the alleged financial irregularities that led to the law firm closing down, resulting in him being found guilty of professional misconduct and struck off in 2017. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he has not worked in football since.Yet Davies, I imagine, was grateful to have his family member in such close proximity. Amid many strange goings-on at Forest under their regime, the manager was handed a bumper new contract when he was only eight months into his initial three-and-a-half-year deal.On a different theme, you might have seen the headlines recently about the agent James Warnock’s close links to Cardiff City. How close exactly? Well, pretty close. James, a representative of Unique Sports Management, is listed by the FA as being directly involved in deals relating to the club where his father, Neil, is the manager.USM certainly does well out of Cardiff (six transactions from February 2017 to January 2018 alone) even when Warnock Jr is not involved and the point to note here is that the FA does have rules, under Section E4 of the Working with Intermediaries Regulations, to specify clubs and agents should not do business with one another if there is a family link.How stringently the FA follows these rules is another matter, possibly, because a look through the archives suggests little has changed since it was decided the regulations needed updating. To quote the ’s article from 24 October 2006: “The new regulations will extend the existing rules outlining ‘conflicts of interests’ to outlaw a repeat of the situation that has allowed David Unsworth, whose agent, HN Sports, employs James Warnock, the son of the Sheffield United manager Neil, to sign for that club.” So, how that did that work out then?This is not to imply even a whiff of wrongdoing, of course, but perhaps it would be cleaner all round if Cardiff did the same with the Warnocks as Manchester United did with Sir Alex Ferguson and his son, Jason, then an agent with 13 players from Old Trafford among his list of clients, and announce it would not be doing business that way any longer.Equally, I would be just as intrigued to learn what it was that prompted Cardiff in January last year, going for promotion to the Premier League, to recruit Paul and Jack McKay, twin brothers whose careers until that stage could be politely described as, well, slow-burning.Recognise the name? The McKays’ father, Willie, is a big-time football agent, the kind many clubs want to keep happy, and part of the complex web of middle men, along with his other son, Mark, in the Emiliano Sala transfer. Paul and Jack had previously been together at Doncaster Rovers, where Willie had got himself an exclusive two-year consultancy to handle transfers, and also spent time without anybody really noticing at Leeds United under the management of Steve Evans.In both cases, it is fair to say they were some way below the required grade, meaning a series of loan moves involving Ilkeston Town, Gainsborough Trinity and Airdrieonians. They are 22 now. One is on loan at Chesterfield, the other at Morecambe, and somehow I don’t imagine either player getting a single minute of first-team football for the club that gave them, very generously, two-and-a-half-year contracts amid a promotion chase to the top ision.All of which reminds me of the curious story of Myles Anderson, who was awarded a two-year deal at Blackburn Rovers, then a Premier League club, in the days when his father, Jerome, the agent Sir Alex Ferguson once said “couldn’t pick his nose”, had been trusted with a leading role at Ewood Park, as an adviser to the club’s Indian owners.Anderson Jr had previously made one appearance as a professional footballer, for two minutes, as a substitute for Aberdeen. Yet Steve Kean, a client of Jerome Anderson, memorably said we could be looking at another late developer in the mould of Chris Smalling. Not quite: Blackburn’s new recruit did not make a single appearance for the club and his contract was terminated after 16 months. Funny business, football, just not always in an amusing sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26dcc92f14abb6b725d269c0a4ccc37261fe48f6/0_99_4896_2939/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=213ea982300b0604acd92656c8919d9c","title":"london bike show preview london excel","story":"The annual cycle show opens its doors next month – and there is no better place to take the pulse of all things pedal relatedAs the curfew of winter begins to shift, I feel that familiar urge to get back on my bike and head for the hills.

Like paying tax, for example. Similarly, I’ve always thought parenting fell into the same category. The dirty jobs of parenting, at least. A graph that plotted ‘net worth’ vs ‘time spent picking snot out of a child’s nostril’ would basically be a sheer slope of gleefully abandoned responsibilities.That’s why it’s as difficult to picture Beyoncé wiping sick from her child’s hair in an airport toilet as it is to imagine her and Jay-Z having a cabinet under their sink filled with plastic bags. You don’t need proof that Prince Charles has never held a Tommee Tippee cup, you just know in your bones that he hasn’t.All of which came to mind last week when I was reminded that Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has about 186 children, proudly boasts that he’s never changed a nappy. A life of hyper-wealth has limited his experience of parenting to dressing his kids in suits he’s salvaged from a haunted chest of ventriloquist’s dummies he was left by a great aunt in Rhodesia.I’d like to be more involved in my son’s care than that, but I guess I can’t blame the rich for outsourcing parenting’s less enviable duties. Much of our daily life involves tasks my wife and I would happily never do again, if it were financially or socially acceptable. For her, it’d be feeding him solids, a process which has begun in earnest and is slow to catch on. He reacts to each offering of pulpy paste as if it’s a spoonful of wax he’s just seen us extract from our own ears. Attempts to make him eat usually end with a thick film of butternut squash purée all over his face, hands and a 10m radius around his high chair.Personally, I’d delegate the dread task of cutting his nails. These extend from my son’s fingers at a rate more common to tree-dwelling mammals, or those guys in the Guinness Book of Records whose big curly claws twist and spiral to the ground. Holding him still is impossible, since he takes to the process like he’s being tortured. He’s no doubt startled that I have introduced sharp cutting tools into our relationship.As I sweat, fret and constantly visualise dismembering his stumpy little digits, he wriggles and squirms like a cat being forced into a microwave. If I had the cash to pay for a steady-handed tree surgeon to do the business each week, maybe with those special scissors bomb technicians use when attempting to select the right wire, I’d forgo the ventriloquist dummy suits and pay for that instead.Some say I should bite them for him which would, ironically enough, be less nail-biting for us both, but I can’t bring myself to do that either. We may not be rich, but your health is your wealth, and butternut squash is likely the least of what he has under there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32ef75a20b2a2df3118c5a054a2b18b4d30db98/0_582_6271_3763/master/6271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f05faaea45aa19f950042ee143df19b4","title":"high rents alternative living arrangements","story":"With spiralling rents leaving many people with barely any disposable income, let alone the means to save towards a deposit, some are now choosing alternatives.Office administrator Tina Gotla-Aluri, 42, was struggling to cope with the £950 a month she was paying for her house share in Putney, south-west London, when a friend suggested Share and Care Homeshare, which matches older homeowners who have a spare room with people who can offer practical help in exchange. She now lives in Putney with a man in his 90s and pays £180 a month to the scheme.In return, Gotla-Aluri provides companionship, goes food shopping, and cooks meals. “He is quite well travelled and food is one of the things we have bonded over,” she says. “I cook British food like Sunday dinners and sometimes Indian or Moroccan food. It’s mutually beneficial.”She says the lower rent has made her less anxious about money. “It has given me breathing space. It was very stressful. I was only working to pay rent, and as an administrator I don’t make much. I hardly had anything left for food and travel. It was very depressing, but now I can go to the cinema and out with friends.”When Michael Hayne, 41, a delivery driver from Mansfield, split up with his wife after 10 years of marriage with two daughters, he sofa-surfed at various family members’ homes for about six months because he couldn’t afford to rent.“I worked out it was about £1,100 to get a house to rent plus bills,” he says. “I needed somewhere for the kids to stay and didn’t want a bedsit. I realised I wouldn’t have much money left after paying child maintenance and childcare costs.”He was inspired by reading about a couple who sold up and toured the world in a van. “I took out a loan and bought a Mercedes Sprinter van for £2,500 and spent weeks stripping it out and turning it into a home.” His van includes beds for when his daughters stay, a four-burner cooker and storage at the back for his bike.“I wanted a van because it’s cheaper than a camper van, which can cost upwards of £10,000, plus I like the style of a van. It’s a blank canvas that I can build myself. For example, I made a sleeping area for my girls, and I can change it around.”The cost of running the van, including vehicle tax and breakdown insurance but not petrol, sets him back about £70 a month.Hayne has lived in the van for a year and parks for free in country lanes and near industrial estates. He showers at a local gym. “The girls love it. They’ve been to Scotland, Whitby, Scarborough and the Norfolk coast. Not paying rent frees up the funds to do those things.”While some people house-sit for free to get a taste of luxury or a different life for a few weeks, designer Jennifer Hamley, 39, and her husband, Ben, 37, have turned it into a way to live rent-free.“We decided to try house-sitting after we came back from a year living in Bali,” says Hamley. “Rental prices had escalated and a friend suggested it. We run a business together from our laptops, and are used to being a little nomadic, so the idea suited us well.”The couple tend to stay in a property for at least three weeks, depending on what’s available. “Since we do this full time we tend to only apply for house-sits of three weeks or more. Running a business and moving around too much is way too stressful.”“It is a peace of mind for many homeowners. A homeowner doesn’t need to get anyone to check in on the house, and pet owners don’t have to pay kennels, catteries or dog walkers.”Sometimes there’s a signed agreement but mostly the exchange is done on trust. The duo try to line up consecutive house-sits but sometimes there are a few days’ gap, when they stay in a hotel, B\u0026ampB, Airbnb, or with friends.If Carl Francis, 27, was renting his one-bedroom flat in Barnet, north London, at market rates, he simply wouldn’t be able to afford it. But as a property  – a person who temporarily looks after an empty property that’s between uses in return for cheap rent – his rent comes to just £425 a month.“I didn’t want a cramped studio flat for £600,” he says. He found Dot Dot Dot, which provides affordable housing in buildings that range from flats and houses to churches and even disused fire stations. In return it asks s to volunteer for 16 hours a month with a charity of their choice.“I’m saving a hell of a lot more than if I was living on my own,” he says. The drawback is the property is set to be demolished. “Then I’ll be given 28 days’ notice. But I’ve been here for a year and it’s a really good way to live.”Patrick Smith, 62, the director of a vegan catering co-operative, lives with nine other people in a housing co-op in Nottingham, where he pays a fraction of the typical rent. Housing co-ops tend to be democratic organisations controlled by members, who set their own policies and decisions. In Smith’s co-op, the housemates have two meetings a month, discussing topics such as household issues, cleaning and checking in with others’ wellbeing.The household vies up chores, with each member spending 30 minutes a week cleaning a designated area. The tenants are the landlords and they set their own rent and take responsibility for the needs of the household.Each person has their own bedroom but shares communal areas such as lounge, bathrooms and kitchen, where every night a member cooks a group meal.“Rather than it just being about finances, everyone wants to engage in a sustainable cooperatively managed household.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He was released from immigration custody on Wednesday on a $100,000 bond.Abraham-Joseph, 26, told ABC’s Good Morning America he had no idea what a visa was when his mother brought him to the US when he was seven. His visa expired in 2006.“I knew I wasn’t born here,” he said. “But I didn’t know like, what that meant as far as when I transitioned into an adult, how it was going to affect my life.”The rapper said he wasn’t hiding the fact that he isn’t a US citizen, but “I didn’t want to get deported so I’m not going to just come out and say, ‘Hey by the way, I wasn’t born here.”’His lawyers have said he applied for a new visa in 2017, and his case remains pending. One of his lawyers, Charles Kuck, said earlier this week that if the case follows the normal trajectory, it could take two to three years.While Abraham-Joseph was in immigration custody, his lawyers became aware of an outstanding warrant in Liberty county, along Georgia’s coast, and made arrangements for him to turn himself in, attorney Abbi Taylor said.News outlets report the warrant was for theft by deception. It stemmed from what Taylor said was essentially a civil dispute. Abraham-Joseph performed a concert in Liberty county several years ago and the person who had booked the concert didn’t feel he had done enough and sought a warrant rather than suing him, she said.After turning himself in on Friday morning, Abraham-Joseph was released on his own recognizance. His legal team is working to resolve the underlying issue, Taylor said.Abraham-Joseph said he believes the way immigration policy is enforced is broken, that he doesn’t think people “should be arrested and put in a place where a murderer would be for just being in the country for too long”.Attorney Alex Spiro said he believes Abraham-Joseph was targeted “because he’s both a celebrity and they can use this as a way to send a message and also, perhaps, because of his music”.He said he hopes the attention can help others held in immigration detention.“There’s people that are just totally forgotten that exist in these detention centers,” Spiro said, later adding: “I’m hoping people like 21 Savage will bring light to these issues and help the people that are forgotten.”Ice spokesman Bryan Cox said shortly after Abraham-Joseph was taken into custody that he was arrested in a targeted operation that had been planned weeks to months in advance. Cox said at the time Abraham-Joseph had overstayed his visa and also was convicted on felony drug charges in Fulton County, Georgia, in October 2014.Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers have disputed that he has a felony conviction on his record.“He has a singular offense for marijuana when he was a college-age person,” Spiro said in the television interview. “That’s vacated, sealed. There’s no issue.”Fulton county prosecutors have said they can’t comment on the case, which they say was handled under the state’s first offender law and is sealed.An Atlanta police report from August 2014 says Abraham-Joseph was riding in a car driven by another man when officers stopped the car after an illegal U-turn in four lanes of traffic. During a search of the car with a police dog, officers found a jar containing 22.6g of marijuana, 89 hydrocodone pills, a scale in plain view, two loaded guns and $1,775 in cash the report says.Both men were arrested and charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of hydrocodone with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, the report says.A notice of seizure and forfeiture filed in Fulton county superior court in October 2014 says the $1,775 seized during the arrest is to be forfeited. It says the violation of law alleged is that Abraham-Joseph and the other man possessed marijuana.Abraham-Joseph was nominated for two awards at the Grammys, including record of the year for Rockstar alongside Post Malone. His second solo album I Am I Was, released in December, debuted at No 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

This country is limping towards a chaotic exit. The strident voices of the far right shouting down any rational discussion. We have a PM who is incompetent and who has become an international embarrassment, an ineffectual leader of the opposition at odds with his membership and half his party and a media largely hell bent on driving us over the cliff. How has our once revered democracy morphed into this mess? DaivedoverEvery time that May makes a concession to the ERG they take a step back to reveal yet another demand and uncover more of the trap that has been there all along. She is like a weak, second-rate school teacher who is letting the louts in the back row of her class dominate and control all lessons. The ERG has a clear agenda of their own and that has nothing to do with what is best for the country or for the majority of people in the country. These are the arrogant and self-serving men who conned and coerced voters into taking back control and now expect that power to be given to them. Theresa May is incapable of spotting a wolf in wolf’s clothing. Why? John HewardYou get what you deserve. May has been trying to play to all sides of the argument. It cannot work. The hard right Tories will only accept a no strings deal. The more centrist Tories want to either remain or have a deal that to a certain extent, ties us to Europe. This is where Tories have existed for decades. Surely May didn’t really think that the two groups would unite over policies that either side could not agree to? She did not think to plan an exit before even triggering article 50. She should have spent a year in trying to find consensus instead of just applying her “my way or the byway” approach. Cameron is to blame for this fiasco, but May is guilty of completely mishandling the whole thing. morbileBrexit is bad enough, but the constitutional disaster that May and co are overseeing is worse. In the space of just over two months, her government has been found in contempt of parliament, and heavily lost votes on key items of government policy. Yet she maintains that nothing has changed, continues on her path unaltered with little or no admonition from the populist press or the public. Given the precedents she is setting - if a really competent leader ever got into power, imagine what havoc could be wreaked - as parliamentary scrutiny has effectively been shown to be, well, ineffective. dougmeyberryBetween the Malthouse fiasco and now the ERG abstaining on this vote (and handing May another authority sapping defeat) the PM needs to stop pretending that Rees-Mogg and his merry men will accept anything except a no-deal exit. The days are long gone where there was any point in pretending that she can somehow come to terms with them, except by a complete surrender to their position. If there are any solutions to this mess, it will be in found spite of the ERG, and pretending it can be part of any solution is delusional. CaligulaMcNuttMay’s premiership has delivered the very worst of all worlds. It has allowed the ERG to undermine her from the sidelines, given disproportionate levels of influence to the DUP, and allowed no-deal advocates like Davis and Raab to fritter away two years’ worth of negotiating time while supposedly acting as Brexit Secretary. On the evidence since 2017, May must now outstrip Cameron as our worst PM ever. Her almost unique combination of total inflexibility, weakness and insecurity leads to her appeasing the ERG and the hard Brexiteers in her own party while failing to realise that the ERG aren’t remotely interested in anything other than “no deal” WestonTigerSurely it’s time that even Theresa May acknowledges that the ERG are not acting in good faith? They’re advocating no deal because they know parliament will finally have too much sense to go down that route, leaving them free to proclaim their ideological purity and completely disassociate themselves from any problems that arise from Brexit. davidabsalomThe Tories have completely failed at every stage of this process, from calling a referendum on the issue in the first place to everything that has ensued as a result. Any PM with even a crumb of authority would have disciplined or expelled members of herhis party who vote against the interests of the nation. May clearly has no authority and, it is becoming clear, no respect for the good of the nation. Brexit must be paused of stopped altogether so we can bring in a government worthy of the name.

Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend. Then on 25 and 26 March, MPs of all parties say they will be ready to rally behind a “lethal” amendment that will allow May’s deal to be passed, but only on condition that it is first ratified and approved by the British people in a referendum. Such a referendum would require article 50 to be delayed.If the British people reject May’s deal in that second public vote, the UK would in all probability stay in the EU on its current terms.MPs who backed Remain in the 2016 referendum – and who are appalled by May’s attempts to “run down the clock” in the hope of forcing parliament to vote for her hugely unpopular deal – believe that the two-pronged approach of involving the public and politicians has a good chance of averting a disastrous Brexit outcome, albeit at the 11th hour.While some at Westminster believe the chances of securing a second referendum have faded, supporters of the latest plans say the Commons will be most likely to back another public vote at the moment when a nervous nation will be on the brink of the biggest decision in its postwar history, one that will affect the futures of millions of British people. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.On Saturday one of the strategists behind the planned amendment, the Labour MP Peter Kyle, said that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, were enthusiastic about the plan and looking at whether Labour could whip for his amendment.“I know they are both warm to the idea,” Kyle said. “In the next few days they will be testing how wide support for this amendment is in the party.”Another senior Labour MP involved in talks about what is being called parliament’s “final showdown” said: “By that stage, at one minute before midnight, Labour will have no option but to back the Kyle amendment as a route to a second referendum, as they will have run out of alternatives. There should also be enough Tories who will see the sense in allowing the public either to sign off on, or reject, May’s deal. This is clearly the best way to end this argument for good.”The shadow Scotland minister, Paul Sweeney, threw his support behind the strategy at a meeting of Labour MPs last week on Thursday entitled “Love Socialism, Hate Brexit”. He said: “It’s not about a people’s vote. It is not about overturning any view.”Sweeney added that, if May was so confident her deal was the best one available, she should be willing to test it against public opinion, in the same way that the Irish peace process was subject to ratification by the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic in 1998. “If Theresa May is not willing to compromise on her deal, then if she’s that confident in it she should approach it the same way as the Good Friday agreement, so there was a ratification … We give the people a final say.”Most MPs believe the prime minister will try to leave a final crucial Commons vote on her deal until the last possible moment, probably early in the week after she returns from an EU summit in Brussels on 21 and 22 March. But that eventual “meaningful vote” – likely on 25 or 26 March – would be amendable, giving those MPs who believe the issue must be put back to the people their opportunity to strike.Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Conservative Oliver Letwin plan to table an amendment in the next fortnight that would force May to apply to the EU to extend article 50 for an unspecified period beyond 29 March if the prime minister has not secured parliamentary backing for a deal by the middle of March. But supporters of another referendum say the final piece of the jigsaw will be to get MPs to support another public vote during the extension period.This week May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn – both facing splits within their own parties and possible resignations over Brexit – will hold talks with European leaders in an attempt to find a breakthrough. But hopes that the two leaders can agree on a cross-party way forward are fading, not least because of the prime minister’s refusal to accept Labour’s central demand for a UK-wide customs union and her opposition to taking the option of no deal off the table.In October an estimated 700,000 people from all over the UK marched peacefully on parliament to demand a second referendum on Brexit. The event was the biggest outpouring of public opposition to government policy since the anti-Iraq-war protest in 2003.The event on 23 March will be entitled “Put It to the People”, and the organisers say it will be for all those people who want to stop a disastrous Brexit, not just dyed-in-the-wool Remainers who have always been wedded to the idea of reversing the referendum decision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b49dbb7e1faa7b73e6566f64509ff9b1f1ca9d/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a32871dd16b3f4b492eea78f6c1f297","title":"laura muir routs kirsty wades 31 year old british indoor mile record","story":"No sooner had Laura Muir obliterated the 31-year-old British indoor mile record by an astonishing five seconds than she started wrapping herself up in cotton wool. She knows the biggest threat to retaining her European 1500m and 3,000m titles in Glasgow could be the February flu rather than anything on two legs. She did not pose for selfies, as she usually does instead her coach Andy Young handed fans autographed photographs.A smiling Muir said: “I signed 66 cards – so I hope that’s enough for everyone. I didn’t want to leave the fans without things but I’ve got to look after my own health.”It is surely a wise precaution given how supreme and sublime Muir looked in chasing down Kirsty Wade’s 4min 23.86sec, set in 1988, to claim her sixth British record. For good measure her time of 4:18.75 was the third-fastest mile in history and broke her own 1500m national indoor record.Initially, Muir’s pace was steady as she went through halfway bang on schedule in 2:12. But when her pacemaker dropped out and it became a four-lap time-trial the 25-year-old Scot hunted the record down with zealous intent before tumbling over the line.“It’s pretty special to get the record, especially one which has stood for such a long time and from an iconic runner with Kirsty,” said Muir. “It’s a world lead, the third-fastest ever behind the European and world records so I’ll take that.”“For the next two weeks I’ll try to stay away from as many people as possible – not that I don’t like people, it’s just colds are everywhere.”There was no such joy for the double European 60m champion Richard Kilty, whose chances of a historic treble evaporated when he fell just short of the 6.60sec British qualifying standard in the men’s final.With the country’s two best 60m sprinters, Reece Prescod and CJ Ujah, swerving Glasgow it is possible that no male sprinters will be selected for the team.What frustrates Kilty is that while European Athletics allows anyone who has run 6.78sec to compete in its championships, British Athletics has insisted on a much stricter criteria, which he has failed to meet because of foot and achilles’ injuries.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsIt has left Kilty, who finished fifth in the final won by China’s Su Bingtian in 6.47, relying on the unlikely possibility that the selectors hand him a reprieve when they announce their team on Sunday.“During the last two Euros, 6.60 has got at least a bronze so I would be in with a shout of a medal if I went,” he said. “I know I am capable of running faster than that, which puts me in with a chance of defending my title. I really do have faith in myself.“My message to selectors is that I am a championship performer who has never been beaten in a major championship. Hopefully, they have some faith in me. It would mean the world to me to stand on the line after the year and a half I have had.”As things stand the British selectors could name only Ojie Edoburun, who finished last in last week’s trials, and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who did not get out of the semi-finals – both of whom would qualify having run 10.20 outdoors last year.Asha Philip, who finished second to the Jamaican Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson, in the women’s 60m final, said she would take Kilty. “He’s had a few injuries and niggles but I know that he’s capable,” she said. “I would put my money on Kilty if they take him.”Holly Bradshaw produced her second-best pole vault since 2012, clearing 4.81m to beat a stacked field that included the Greek Olympic champion, Katerina Stefanidi, and she revealed that she had been dropped by her sponsors Nike in January.“Obviously, a little bit harder but I’ve been really sensible over the past couple of years,” she said. “Hopefully if people see me performing they might want to sponsor me.”She denied that being dropped had given her a wake-up call. “Stuff like that doesn’t spur me on. I’m just trying to do good for me. I love pole vaulting and I love the feeling of flying.”There was a world record in the men’s 1500m as the 19-year-old Ethiopian Samuel Tefera won a sprint finish against his compatriot Yomif Kejelcha to beat Hicham El Guerrouj’s mark and win in 3.31.04. “I can’t believe that,” said Tefera."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34c2bf4d6173ba14be98b9fdf3c6a351416e1241/0_163_4873_2924/master/4873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31399203a41fc59c893b36100a7ea886","title":"keithley cougars rugby league","story":"In dark times, stories of resurrection have always worked a treat for those trying to flog a religion or sell a little hope. And in a small Yorkshire town once sustained by textiles, resurrection is exactly what a likable offbeat collective is trying to bring.Keighley Rugby League Club, a regular member of the last-chance saloon, was placed in special measures in November for failing to pay the players’ wages. It looked to be in dire trouble, only to be rescued at the 11th hour by a consortium of familiar faces, the men in charge during the glory years of the 1990s, when the waiting list for boundary boards was so long that the club flogged advertising space on the roof.Back in 1991, when Mick O’Neil and Mike Smith first joined the board, the ground was being used by the Health and Safety Executive as an example of decrepitude, and the club was again near bankruptcy.O’Neil and Smith had grand plans and for four crazy years lived every moment of them. The club was renamed Keighley Cougars, the wooden grandstand, which had been closed and condemned as unsafe after the Bradford City fire, was reopened, a hospitality area built and the ground became known as Cougar Park. They signed the world champion American gladiator Wesley “Two Scoops” Berry as a publicity stunt and started the then innovative practice of giving inidual players theme tunes.They began a pioneering community cohesion programme, taking 1,000 local school children down to Wembley to watch Great Britain and had government ministers coming up to visit the Cougar Classroom. Crowd numbers mushroomed from the hundreds to four, five, six thousand as Cougarmania hit the town and gave the people of Keighley something to swing behind. It was a galvanising, groundbreaking example of what a sports club with real meaning to the local community can do.In 1993, they won the Third Division, in 1995 the Second Division and promotion to the top tier, then known as the Stones Bitter Championship. But then disaster: Rupert Murdoch took a personal interest in British rugby league as part of his pay-TV battles in Australia, the summer Super League was formed and Keighley were left the wrong side of the ide.The coach left, the sponsors fell away, as did the crowds, and the wage bill, built on presumption of top ision status, was unpayable. The club went bust and the leading members of the management went their separate ways to Australia, Switzerland and Spain. “We felt like a rock group who’d been stabbed in the heart.” says Smith.But they’re back – Smith, Mick O’Neil and Tim Wood, the old Cougars company director – alongside O’Neil’s son, Ryan, and his husband, Kaue Garcia. “We’re untypical,” says Smith, “We’re all half crazy, we’ve got a couple of old halfwits, two gay guys, a Brazilian, and one with a brain.”Ryan O’Neil, who has lived away from Keighley for 20 years, can’t quite believe he’s back. “Growing up in Keighley as a closeted gay man wasn’t the easiest. When the consortium succeeded I suddenly began to think: ‘How are they going to welcome us, two poofs, one of them Brazilian.’ There’s not many gay directors of sports clubs – well, Elton John had Watford. This is a very old‑fashioned community. But I’ve had more homophobic abuse in Brighton than Keighley.”And hang it, they’re dreaming big, with ideas of somehow persuading Boy George to come and perform a lightly edited version of Karma Chameleon (Cougar Kameleon) and urging Garcia, a volleyball fan being rapidly inducted into rugby league, to bring over Brazilian dancing girls from the carnival. He’s unsure: “I think we need the crowds first,” he says. “I’m not sure they’re going to come for 400 people.”There are more down-to-earth aims too, to unite the white and Asian communities in Keighley that largely exist separately of each other. The directors would like to transform the all-white crowds – with ideas of occasional Kabaddi matches and tikka and naan wraps for sale as fans walk through the gate.Smith can still smell the passion: “Cougarmania brought hope to a deprived area. People still stop me in the street and say: ‘It was the happiest days of my life.’ We want to do that again. At the end of the day we’re selling happiness, there isn’t a great deal of happiness around.”The Hall of Fame bar, hung with pictures of former greats, currently doesn’t have a ceiling or a floor, though a local Asian business has offered to install flooring tiles. Ryan O’Neil admits that enthusiasm may have got the better of them. “We did zero due diligence financially, we just didn’t want the momentum to stop.”But they’re in it for the long-term and in the next three years hope to establish themselves as one of the top 20 clubs in the country. It’s quite a wish – they’re currently 37th out 37 professional clubs after starting the season with a 12-point penalty because of the winter’s shenanigans.So keep an eye out for the Cougar Convoy today, two buses and 100 cars on the way to Whitehaven for the first game of the season. They represent a town caught between the Leeds-Bradford conurbation and Haworth country and a club trying to come back at a time of economic uncertainty and with community ision, not togetherness, the current vogue. The saviours are older, wiser, more inclusive than before, hoping that social media and their sheer passion for the whole damn project might put Keighley back on the sporting map. Who wouldn’t wish them luck?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c0d27d344d135c5ee21bca682ff660cce521707/0_63_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0da05dc3027009742ec13105f8e4e5fb","title":"parliamentary report facebook stricter regulations","story":"Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself and must be subject to sweeping new legislation, a parliamentary report will announce on Monday.It will also call on the government to launch an independent investigation into foreign interference in British elections since 2014. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee will publish what is expected to be a landmark report into fake news and disinformation at midnight on Sunday night.It is expected to be savagely critical of Facebook and its “duplicitous” chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who has ignored calls to give evidence to the committee.The committee, chaired by Damian Collins, Tory MP for Folkestone, has been at the forefront of global efforts to expose the role of tech giants in disrupting elections across the world, and has been co-ordinating the efforts of a committee of politicians from nine countries.Collins said on Friday that the committee would be releasing unpublished documents from Six4Three, a US software developer engaged in a bitter dispute with Facebook. “When the Cambridge Analytica story broke,” he said, “Facebook made all these public pronouncements about how shocked they were that people’s data had been abused. What these documents show is that this was actually their MO. The scale of the deception they practised is really quite breathtaking.”The Washington Post claimed last week that Facebook was in negotiations with the US Federal Trade Commission over the data mishandling exposed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The fine is reported to potentially run into billions of dollars. The documents published by parliament are expected to show further evidence of its abuse of competition laws. The report will throw the spotlight once again on the use of data in the EU referendum.Chris Vickery, a cybersecurity expert, handed over a vast repository of material relating to AIQ, the Canadian data firm used by Vote Leave in the referendum.The committee has engaged outside experts to assess the evidence, some of which was published by the Observer and which showed similarities in the code used by four Leave campaigns that hired AIQ: Vote Leave, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the DUP. Under British electoral laws, it is illegal for campaigns to co-ordinate unless they declare spending jointly.But it is the committee’s call for an independent investigation into foreign interference in British elections that is likely to be least welcomed by the government. It will put Theresa May in a potentially embarrassing spot. She called out Russian attempts to interfere in British democracy in a speech she made in November 2017 but has been silent ever since, despite mounting evidence including the Observer’s revelations of a covert relationship between Arron Banks, the funder of the Leave.EU campaign, and the Russian government.The source of Banks’s donation is now the subject of an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA), but the government has refused to say if any investigation is going on into his links to Russia, despite calls to do so from Collins and Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22cdc227279fb83d1ef12fec2f4bb282e4f6297/0_0_1204_898/master/1204.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=425acfae7b17d12674a3318a583919f4 700w","title":"sundays best tv top gear baptiste traitors time travelling bong","story":"Matt LeBlanc’s time as host of the motoring show enters its final straight, while a slowburning spin-off of The Missing beginsWhen looking back on Matt LeBlanc’s run on Top Gear, TV historians might conclude that the leather-jacketed Friends hunk was always stuck in second gear.

Warren and Klobuchar join senators Kirsten Gillibrand (New York), Kamala Harris (California) and Cory Booker (New Jersey), as well as Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro and former Maryland congressman John Delaney.Nearly all have touted their progressive bona fides in the hopes of appealing to an energized base. That, some operatives say, has left the “centrist” lane open, at a time when the party must win back working-class and independent voters who chose Trump in 2016.At the same time, some argue that debate over the Democrats’ supposed “lurch to the left”, as relentlessly highlighted by the president, is an oversimplification that overlooks the Democratic electorate’s desire to limit Trump to one term.“The challenge for Democrats will be to have a substantive, even heated debate over progressive policy while still reminding voters that re-electing Trump would be a catastrophe,” said Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama whose podcast, The Wilderness, examined the rebuilding of the party after 2016.“Democratic candidates should debate each other but they shouldn’t disqualify each other,” he said.It’s all a far cry from the 2016 primary, when the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders mounted an unexpectedly tough challenge to Hillary Clinton, from the left and with lasting consequences.Sanders pushed Clinton on issues including climate change, trade, Wall Street reform and college affordability. As he did so, he strengthened the progressive wing of the party.Most 2020 candidates have offered progressive platforms. Warren, Gillibrand, Harris and Booker have signed on to Medicare for All, the single-payer healthcare proposal drafted by Sanders. Warren and Gillibrand have called for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency at the heart of Trump’s hardline agenda. Harris has said its role must be reformed.Many of the contenders have pushed a variation of debt-free college tuition and Warren, Gillibrand, Booker and Harris have embraced the Green New Deal championed by rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.In a sign of the potential rifts to come, Klobuchar said proposals such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All were “aspirational”.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was chief economics adviser to vice-president Joe Biden, said Democrats were broadly aligned on principles but differed on how to pursue them.“There’s going to be a lot of Democrats on the stage when the primaries begin,” he said, “but I don’t think there’ll be nearly as much distance between them as people think.”Differences, he said, would likely amount to one candidate campaigning on a subsidized jobs program tailored to a marginal group versus another advocating for a guaranteed jobs program affecting millions of people.“They’re all trying to solve the same problems,” he said. “Excessive levels of wealth concentration, money in politics, climate, affordable access to higher education. The question is how far does each of them want to push in terms of solutions to those problems.”Biden has been mulling a third run for president and would be the most establishment-friendly figure if he did jump in. He leads several early polls, bolstered in part by name recognition and Obama’s legacy.Other potential contenders include Sanders, who would seek to recapture the grassroots energy of 2016, and Beto O’Rourke, the former congressman whose unsuccessful Senate bid in Texas earned national attention. The Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, another favorite of progressives, staged a listening tour in key states and is expected to mount a bid.Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, expressed frustration that debate in the party was “frozen in time”, in 2016, and thereby ignoring victories in the 2018 midterms.“The electorate is liberal but more practical than the discussion seems to belie,” she said. “I think subconsciously they will think about electability and who can assemble the biggest coalition to take on Trump.”Tanden also warned of potential blowback from pressure to adopt striking positions, stating: “In 2018, there was not a single candidate in a swing district who embraced abolishing Ice. People talked about reforming Ice.”Republicans have sought to cast the Democrats’ agenda as “socialist”, zeroing in on healthcare and tax proposals that poll better than the GOP seems to think.Trump previewed a likely 2020 attack line in his state of the union address, declaring: “Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.”“Tonight,” he said, “we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”But even as roughly half of voters appear to be skeptical of a “socialist” candidate, the country’s definition of socialism has evolved towards a concept of equality, calling into question whether it is still an effective scare word.Favreau said he did not believe most voters would impose a “litmus test” on most issues. But he cautioned any candidates who might be inclined to play it safe.“I do think Democrats are looking for candidates who are willing to propose solutions that are commensurate with the magnitude of the challenges we’re facing,” he said. “Saving the planet and guaranteeing universal healthcare will require more than a few new tax credits and regulations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e604db01a7bbb9115780aa4ca58e1ceb33cb94d9/0_28_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb0a7d8dab34e47c309011f343d85144","title":"nigerian elections postponed by a week","story":"The vote was rescheduled just five hours before polls were to openNigeria’s president and his main challenger have blamed each other for the last-minute postponement of the country’s election, delayed just five hours before polls were due to open.Millions of Nigerians who had planned to vote woke up to the news on Saturday that the independent electoral commission (INEC) had deemed holding the poll “no longer feasible”. It will now be held on 23 February, INEC said.The opposition said President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration had instigated the delay.“Their plan is to provoke the public, hoping for a negative reaction, and then use that as an excuse for further anti-democratic acts,” said Atiku Abubakar, the People’s Democratic party’s presidential candidate, urging voters to come out in greater numbers next weekend.Buhari said he was deeply disappointed after the electoral commission had “given assurances, day after day and almost hour after hour that they are in complete readiness for the elections. We and all our citizens believed them.”People all over the country expressed their disappointment. Many will now not be able to vote, having travelled especially to their states of origin, and needing to get back to work.“The election was cancelled on election day. That’s Nigeria for you,” said Wole Jimoh, who had been watching the news at home in Lagos, the economic capital, when the 3am announcement was made. “People will have to cancel weddings for this.”Some voters in the northern city of Kano, which was key to Buhari’s victory in 2015, said they would now not bother voting at all, as they were so disillusioned.“We’re disappointed. People had suspended their activities to make sure their vote was counted – and at the 11th hour it was postponed. I don’t think it was really a problem of logistics,” said Sagir Bashir, a computer science student. “It’s two people with power and resources trying to beat their way through the process.”Many streets in Kano were deserted on Saturday morning. Ibrahim Fegge arrived at Kano’s railway station early to join the expected queue, but found it deserted except for some guinea fowl, goats, and a woman making tea.On Friday night, hundreds of temporary workers recruited to help with the election slept in the street outside Kano’s electoral offices. But by 9am they had all gone home.The Kano state governor, Umar Ganduje, was secretly filmed stuffing bundles of dollars for alleged kickbacks for contracts into his robes in a video released last year. But the real power in Kano state lies with former governor Rabiu Kwankwaso, who endorsed Buhari in 2015 but switched to supporting Atiku last year. This has implications for Kano that could swing the result.“Seventy percent of people do what Kwankwaso says,” said Aminu Shehu, a teacher who voted for Buhari in the last election but was planning on voting for Atiku this time. “Many of us make up our own minds, but what Kwankwaso says is always good.”There were a number of security incidents across the country the day before the election.A few hours before the postponement announcement, members of the extremist group Boko Haram attacked a neighbourhood in Maiduguri in the north-east, killing eight people. Another 66 were killed in Kaduna – also on Friday – with Buhari saying he was “pained beyond words”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24b7c1f6b0a5d6694d70d4dba9a84eb041049ed/0_190_3008_1804/master/3008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cd7c2f5a94766f2881bab371525fe56","title":"mexico matamoros strike union jobs","story":"Strikes close or slow production at dozens of assembly plants and factories as workers demand better salariesDespite the winter chill in the air, the mood on the picket line outside the Matamoros Coca-Cola bottling plant was optimistic.“We’re not fighting for ourselves, but for a better quality of life for our kids and their children. They won’t be screwed over or trampled upon by these kinds of people any more,” said Juan Luis Gaytán, 37, a mechanic at the plant, which is operated by Arca Continental, the world’s second-biggest Coca-Cola bottler.A wave of wildcat strikes has rolled across this Mexican border town, as thousands of workers walked off the job to demand better salaries, safer conditions – and union leaders who put members’ concerns ahead of company interests.The strikes have closed or slowed production at dozens of maquiladora assembly plants and other factories located south of the border to take advantage of lower labour costs.But more than two weeks after the strike began, companies are still underestimating the workers’ determination, Gaytán said. “They’re absolutely confident we will give in. But if we give in, then things will stay the same.”There have already been some victories: 48 maquiladoras represented by the Matamoros Industrial Workers and Labourers’ Union announced a settlement to end their stoppages on 9 February, “having met the demands of our unionised workers”.But local activists say the strikes are succeeding in spite of – not because of – the unions.At protest camps across the city, workers complain that union leaders are good at collecting membership dues, but not so efficient when it comes to sharing information or even copies of their collective contracts.“The union has always had us by the throat,” said Heriberto Lomas, a striking employee at a plant manufacturing controls. “Everyone is scared they’ll be fired. That’s why they haven’t gone on strike before.”Despite paltry wages and shabby working conditions, widespread strikes are a rarity in Mexico. Business leaders boast often of “labour peace” – a euphemism for pliant unions, often chosen by the company itself, which receive a kind of “protection money” from management rather than negotiate on behalf of the workers.Nine out of 10 collective-bargaining contracts are agreed to without the consent – and sometimes without the knowledge – of the company’s workers, according to the Wall Street Journal.Unused to negotiating, companies have been caught off-guard by the sudden outbreak of collective bargaining, said Aldo Muñoz, a labour expert at the Autonomous University of Mexico State.“Companies pay more money to protection unions than the bonuses that the striking workers are asking for in Matamoros,” he said.The strikes have spread like wildfire in Matamoros, a city of 450,000 which sits across the border from Brownsville, Texas and has become a magnet for impoverished workers from across the country.Abdio Lorenzo moved to Matamoros 20 years ago from Veracruz and now employs 32 people in a company handling chemical waste. His invoices are going unpaid because of the strike, but like many locals, Lorenzo expressed sympathy for the strikers.“People aren’t listening to their labour leaders any longer,” he said. “It’s become a social movement.”The immediate trigger for the strikes was the inauguration in December of new president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as Amlo, who campaigned on a promise to improve workers’ conditions and promote independent unions.Amlo has not commented on the Matamoros strikes, but observers say he inadvertently triggered the walkouts with a promise to double the minimum wage to 176.20 pesos per day ($9.28) in the northern border region.The increase triggered a clause in some collective contracts in the city which index link pay rises to the minimum wage. In turn, workers on other contracts walked off the job, demanding the same 20-32 deal.Even non-unionised workers have joined the strike, such as delivery drivers at the local dairy.Under a ragged tent pitched outside the Leche Vakita plant, strikers invoked the 20-32 deal, before a rail-thin driver pulled out a neatly printed list of other demands: paid overtime when trucks break down, life insurance – and danger money for out-of-town routes which take them through the most dangerous killing fields of Mexico’s drug war.“They’ve promised these things for years and not done anything,” said Martín Villanueva, who told the story of a colleague who was shot and killed after he got caught in a shootout between rival narcos.He had barely finished speaking when a car pulled up by the picket line, and a stocky man marched up to the drivers shouting that one of their trucks had damaged his vehicle.He pulled a gun, sending strikers – and a  correspondent – running for cover.The drug-fueled violence which has racked the surrounding Tamaulipas state has not affected its booming economy. But local industrialists say that the strike has caused 1,500 job losses – and they are uneasy that it could spread across the borderlands.Susana Prieto Terrazas, a veteran labour lawyer who has been advising the strikers, said that she could not remember a similar outbreak of labour activism in Mexico.“Workers can’t make ends meet and they don’t even make enough to buy a basic basket of goods,” she said in an interview. “The working class is at the end of its tether.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/418e5ee2e5e1d6cf3e435d2d12d9dd57bed8e00b/811_1_2021_1212/master/2021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bfbb95abbaa5f293e7214258c2fc060","title":"week shook thai politics and what comes next princess","story":"A puppet-master in exile and a princess stopped from running for prime minister throw hopes of a return to democracy into doubtIt was last Monday that the incendiary whispers first began.Over the following four days, politicians, foreign embassy officials, journalists and political observers gradually caught wind that a candidate for prime minister would be put forward to run in the elections in March who would turn the political landscape on its head.By Friday morning, to the shock of almost everyone, the rumour was confirmed, setting the ball rolling on one of the most extraordinary weeks in Thai politics in years.Princess Ubolratana, the eldest sister of King Vajiralongkorn, was announced as the sole prime ministerial candidate for Thai Raksa Chart, a newly formed political party linked to, and controlled by, the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who has lived in exile since he lost power in 2006 and faced criminal charges.In Thailand, the royal family is a highly revered institution, protected by some of the strictest laws in the world preventing criticism. According to the constitution, members of the monarchy are not allowed to be involved in the parliamentary process. However, Ubolratana gave up her royal titles in 1972 when she married an American, and despite having moved back to Thailand after her orce, technically had no more privileges than an ordinary citizen.The surprise announcement left Thailand reeling. For more than a decade politics has been fiercely ided between pro-Thaksin “red shirts” and pro-monarchy “yellow shirts”. It was a mighty blow to the military junta, who took power in a bloodless coup in 2014 and hoped to win the election with a political party that presented itself as the representative of royal interests and the party closest to the king.Yellow shirts and royalists, who have long loathed Thaksin for his perceived disrespect of the institutions of the monarchy, also despaired at the new political alliance, fearing it signalled the imminent return of Thaksin. Some in the red-shirt camp considered it to be a great betrayal of democratic principles by Thaksin, who has been a champion of the poor. There were also fears that the princess would be impossible to hold to account. Even though Ubolratana is not officially protected by the lèse-majesté laws, she was still considered part of the royal family and therefore above criticism.But not everyone was against the alliance. Some red shirts praised the move as genius political checkmate by Thaksin: here, finally, was a way to secure votes on both sides of the colour ide, with Ubolratana as the one candidate who could be a match for the military candidate Prayut Chan-ocha and make way for a united and stable pro-Thaksin civilian government.But over the course of 14 hours, the tide turned. By Friday evening, word emerged that the king was to issue a royal decree. The statement was unprecedented, saying in the strongest words possible that Ubolratana’s candidacy was “improper and highly inappropriate”. It ended her prime ministerial dream on the spot. This was the first time the king had publicly stepped into the political realm to exert his authority.“Friday exposed how the Thai monarchy continues to play a huge role in the future of Thai politics,” said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a professor at Kyoto University’s centre for south-east Asian studies.The question now polarising Thai political pundits was: who was playing whom in this saga? Was the miscalculation Thaksin’s or Ubolratana’s? And was the green light from the palace ever given?The line from those in Thai Raksa who spoke to the  is that the princess had directly approached the party’s executive committee and expressed her interest in being a candidate in late November, just after the party was formed. “The assumption was that if she was coming to us offering to run, she had approval from the king. And it certainly was not possible to go directly to the palace to ‘make sure’, that would not have been appropriate,” said a Thai Raksa party member.Umesh Pandey, the former editor of the Bangkok Post who is running as a candidate for Thai Raksa, was one of the only party members willing to speak on the record. He said there had been “complete shock” in the party on Friday evening when the royal decree was published.“Of course, we were confident she would be approved as a candidate otherwise we would not have gone ahead with it,” said Umesh, who did not know about Ubolratana’s candidacy Friday until morning. “As the princess herself has said, it was her own decision to run, she came to us. And she has renounced all her royal titles, so legally she should be entitled to be a candidate.”It appears that the idea was cooked up between Ubolratana and Thaksin in 2018. The pair’s unlikely friendship has long been public knowledge. “Thaksin and Ubolratana have been very close for a long time,” said Pavin, who is in frequent contact with Thaksin. “They meet up quite regularly, their friendship is real.”One source said that in July 2018 Thaksin had openly described the princess as “politically powerless” but said he hoped she could act as a “bridge” to help connect, and eventually reconcile, him with the palace.Thaksin’s presence still looms large over Thai politics, much to the chagrin of the military, who overthrew him in a coup 13 years ago. After his downfall, he was sentenced to multiple criminal charges, forcing him to flee Thailand.But even from exile he still commands huge loyalty across the country for his social security policies that brought millions of people out of poverty and pro-Thaksin parties have won every election this century. He is known to control Pheu Thai, the political party he founded, and masterminded the creation of Thai Raksa in November as a way to increase the chance of pro-Thaksin parties winning the election in a system which is purposely skewed to favour the military.“Clearly this is a sign of desperation by Thaksin, another one of his bold moves to attempt to come home,” said Thailand specialist Eugénie Mérieau.” Andrew MacGregor Marshall, a journalist and author of A Kingdom in Crisis: Thailand’s Struggle for Democracy, said he had concluded that no concrete permission was ever given by the king. “Thaksin is famous for his audacious moves and he is also a gambler, but this is clearly one gamble he hadn’t thought through,” said MacGregor Marshall. “Thaksin really wants to have a royal pardon and come home, and I do think that affects his judgment.”Others, such as veteran Thai political columnist Pravit Rojanaphruk, suggested that in the 14 hours between That Raksa’s announcement and the damning royal decree, the strength of the response to Ubolratana’s candidacy – particularly from the old guard of ultra-monarchists – had prompted a u-turn from the palace.The incident shook the country so severely that by Sunday it was enough to spark coup rumours on social media, which the army chief was forced to deny. . But the greatest damage has been to pro-Thaksin parties, who have long been the strongest champions of democracy in Thai politics. The constitutional court is expected to dissolve Thai Raksa Chart, which leaves about 75 constituencies without a pro-Thaksin party candidate, and there are concerns that the election commission will also use the incident as an excuse to dissolve Pheu Thai on the grounds that it “colluded” in Ubolratana’s nomination.As a result, the return of a military-led government, led by the Prayut, the current junta leader and prime minister, after 24 March looks more likely than ever. Without a civilian government to push for democratic progress in Thailand, the country will remain under the control of the military, whose regime over the past five years has been defined by the suppression of freedom of speech, the imprisonment of critics and a complete lack of accountability and transparency. “This event has been very bad for the general state of Thai democracy,” said Mérieau."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

There’s an unseen network to forests in which trees send signals to each other and form part of a ‘wood wide web’Despite appearances, trees are social beings. For a start, they talk to each other. They’re also sensing, co-operating and collaborating, even across species boundaries. Peter Wohlleben, the German forester-turned-tree-whisperer and author of The Hidden Life of Trees, also says they are suckling their young, that juveniles are learning, and that some elders are sacrificing themselves for the sake of the next generation.While Wohlleben’s view is a step too far towards anthropomorphism for some scientists, the traditional view of trees as isolated, non-sensory beings has been shifting for some time. For example, the phenomenon known as “crown shyness”, in which similarly-sized trees of the same species appear to be respecting each other’s space was recognised almost a century ago. Sometimes, instead of interlacing and jostling for light, the branches of immediate neighbours stop short of one another, leaving a polite gap. There’s still no consensus on how this is managed – abrasion of growing branch tips is one possibility, another is that growth is inhibited when leaves sense infrared light scattered by other leaves close by.Much of the current research on this so called “wood wide web” stems from the work of the Canadian biologist Suzanne Simard. Simard describes the largest inidual trees in a forest as hubs or “mother trees”. Mothers have the deepest, most extensive roots, and are able to supplement smaller trees with water and nutrients, allowing saplings to thrive even in heavy shade. Further experiments suggest that iniduals are able to recognise close relatives and favour them when it comes to transferring the good stuff. Thus healthy iniduals can support damaged neighbours, even leafless stumps, keeping them alive for years, decades, even centuries. This connectivity and collaboration makes much more sense when you realise that the dependent trees may not be random strangers, but old friends, or more persuasive still, close relatives.The discernment shown by trees extends to their enemies as well as allies. Scientists have known for more than 40 years that if a tree is attacked by a leaf-eating animal, it releases ethylene gas. On detecting the ethylene, nearby trees prepare to repel boarders – boosting production of chemicals that make their leaves unpalatable, even toxic. The strategy was first discovered in a study of acacias, and it seems giraffes understood it long before humans: having finished browsing one tree, they habitually move more than 50 metres in an upwind direction before starting on another that is less likely to have sensed the emergency.More recently, however, it’s become clear that not all enemies trigger the same response. When elm and pine trees (and probably others) are first attacked by caterpillars, they respond within seconds to distinctive chemicals in caterpillar saliva, releasing an additional scent that attracts specific varieties of parasitic wasp. The wasps lay eggs in or on the bodies of the caterpillars, and then the emerging wasp grubs devour their host from the inside. If the damage to leaves and branches is caused by something for which the tree has no means of counterattack – such as the wind or cutting with an axe – the chemical response is focused on healing rather than defence.A sobering aspect of recent revelations is that many of these newly recognised “behaviours” are limited to natural growth. In plantations, there are no mother trees, and there is very little connectivity. This is partly because of the way young trees are transplanted and partly because when they are thinned to prevent competition, what little underground connectivity neighbours have established is severed. Seen in this light, modern forestry practices begin to seem almost monstrous: plantations are not communities but crowds of mute, factory-farmed iniduals, felled before they have ever really lived. None of the scientists involved are seriously suggesting trees have feelings, or that the newly discovered sociability of trees is driven by anything other than natural selection. The transactions being observed may be utilitarian rather than altruistic, they might be accidental. Nevertheless, the result is that in supporting each other, trees build sheltered, humid microcosms in which they and their future offspring will stand the best chance of surviving and reproducing. We know these places as forests. The trees, if they “know” anything, know them as home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3795472.1550251905!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gretel to propose a german political clean up","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as Gretel in 2017. During that  turn, Gretel told her cheering audience about Donald Trump: “If they’d asked us ... they’d not have elected that twit.” Photograph: YouTubeEvery political party has something it will never live down. Twink’s 1991 ardfheis turn was more morto than panto for Fine Gael.On Sunday its German sister party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), faces its own Twink moment:\u0026nbspAngela Merkel’s successor as party leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has promised to revive her annual turn as Gretel the cleaning lady at a local “Karneval” party.Karneval is a pre-Lenten fancy dress party tradition that ides Germany into love and loathe camps.Tiny, southwest Saarland is in the love camp, particularly when Gretel arrives on stage, wearing an apron and cloth cap, for some straight talking. In her 2017 turn, Gretel told her cheering audience about Donald Trump: “If they’d asked us . . .\u0026nbspthey’d not have elected that twit.”Sunday is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s first outing as Gretel since she was elected CDU leader in December.But this week she demonstrated she shares her alter-ego’s sweeping and vacuuming skills, cleaning up after her CDU predecessor at a think-in about the 2015-2016 refugee crisis.That brought more than one million people into Germany and, some argue, expedited Angela Merkel’s political end.European demandsAfter two days of therapy, the party issued a series of European demands: a migration early-warning system, common EU asylum standards and reform of Frontex into a real EU border police.\u0026nbspThe paper’s domestic demands saw Kramp-Karrenbauer take a tougher line than Merkel: quicker deportations for failed asylum seekers prisons for criminal migrants and, as ultima ratio in another migration crisis, border closures.It’s clear the new CDU leader is reaching out to her hardline Bavarian allies and her own party voters who drifted off during the migration crisis to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).But many in the CDU fear they will never live down 2015 until they pluck up courage to do something about the woman behind the policy.Merkel’s decision to keep open German borders has made her a humanitarian heroine for some and, for others, a hate figure. Given her polarising potential, the chancellor – no longer CDU leader – stayed away from her party’s migration workshops.MerkelBut that has only amplified the she-who-must-not-be-named element, turning the former party leader into a female version of Harry Potter’s arch-nemesis, Voldemort.The Bild tabloid asked this week: “What is Merkel good for now?”She has warned her party against driving ahead while staring in the migration rear-view mirror.But her CDU successor, until December a state leader on the migration crisis front lines, sees a greater political risk lies in brushing things under the carpet.But what can she deliver? The CDU’s European migration proposals, none of which were new, came with no ideas to overcome the political disagreement in Brussels.And its domestic proposals won’t win the backing of their grand coalition partner, Social Democratic Party (SPD).Cautionary taleYet for Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the fate of the SPD offers a cautionary tale.In 2003, the then SPD chancellor Gerhard Schröder presented his “Agenda 2010” to rescue Germany’s basket case economy. Radical cuts to welfare payments and liberalisation of the labour market revived Germany’s economic heart, still beating strong 16 years later.But the SPD has been in crisis ever since because its core centre-left voters viewed the reforms as a betrayal of everything Germany’s oldest political party stood for: workers’ dignity and the welfare state.After years of half-hearted tinkering, the SPD has now decided to go for broke.Taking a sharp left turn, it has presented proposals of its own for a more liberal dole regime, particularly for older workers, as well as guaranteed minimum pensions and an end to humiliating welfare sanctions.Pull the plugGiven that Berlin’s coalition partners will block each others’ respective migration and welfare proposals, whispers suggest this coalition won’t serve its full term until 2021.Poor SPD results in the European or autumn state elections could see it pull the plug sooner rather than later – despite its puny 17 per cent in polls.Given what’s going on in the world, from Brexit to Trump, German politicians’ capacity for navel gazing is remarkable.But after an extended Merkel-era lull, German politics is undergoing an interesting clear-out. Just ask Gretel, Germany’s answer to Marie Kondo."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3796817.1550389366!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us planes carrying aid for venezuela arrive in colombia","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStaff unload relief goods from the second of three  cargo planes of the US Air Force lands as they celebrate the landing of the second one at the Camilo Daza airport in Cucuta on Saturday. Photograph: Schneyder MendozaEPA A US military transport plane carrying humanitarian aid meant for Venezuelans landed on Saturday in the Colombian border city of Cucuta, where food and medicine is being stored amid uncertainty over how and where aid will be distributed.The shipment will be the second arrival of large-scale US and international aid for Venezuelans, many of whom have scant access to food and medicine, since opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president in defiance of socialist president Nicolas Maduro.Mr Guaido, who argued Mr Maduro’s 2018 re-election was a sham and invoked constitutional provisions to declare himself the country’s leader last month, has said aid will enter Venezuela on February 23rd.But it remains unclear whether Mr Maduro, who has called the aid a US-orchestrated show and denies any crisis, will allow the supplies to cross into Venezuela.Speaking in Caracas to supporters who had volunteered to help with the aid effort, Mr Guaido said he would announce details on Monday about how he planned to get aid into the country from Colombia, Brazil and Curacao despite Mr Maduro’s opposition.“We will organise ourselves into brigades,” Mr Guaido said, calling on the military to allow the aid through. “The message we have to get through to the armed forces is that they have one week to do the right thing. Will you be on the side of your family and your people or of the usurper who keeps lying?”Millions of Venezuelans will be traveling to the border to safeguard arriving aid, Lester Toledo, a Guaido representative, said at a news conference in Cucuta.“We are seven days from this being a reality,” Mr Toledo said. “We are going to have the accompaniment of people, of hundreds of thousands, of millions of Venezuelans that our president Juan Guaido has called upon, who we have asked to go to the border dressed in white as a sign of peace.”A US official told Reuters the aid delivered on Saturday amounted to more than 200 tonnes but a US embassy representative said they had no measurements of the shipment. Mr Toledo said three planes would eventually arrive.Most Western countries and many of Venezuela’s neighbours have recognised Guaido as the legitimate head of state, while Mr Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China and control of Venezuelan state institutions including the military.Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan said on Saturday that the United States used military aircraft to send aid to the Venezuelan border in Colombia because of the urgency of the humanitarian needs. “It’s a message to Venezuela that we are supporting their humanitarian needs,” Mr Shanahan told reporters, adding the aid was being transported by three C-17 aircraft.The supplies, including hygiene kits and special products meant for children suffering malnutrition, are arriving from a US Air Force base in Florida, the US embassy said in a statement.Additional aid flights will take place over the coming days, the statement said, and medical supplies and pharmaceuticals meant for use in hospitals will arrive early next week.The first aid shipment, which included basic foodstuffs and medical supplies, arrived Febuary 8th and is being stored in a Cucuta warehouse.Two bridges outside Cucuta that mark the border between the two countries were open as normal on Saturday. A bridge outside Tienditas, Venezuela, which has never been used, remains blocked on the Venezuelan side by shipping containers.–Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Aerogels are a material made up of air that is stuck within a network made of a solid medium, such as ceramic, metal or carbon.Ceramic aerogels can be incredibly lightweight, but still able to endure demanding environments. However, they are usually very brittle and easily degrade, making them hard to use as insulation and limiting their adoption.However, the new ceramic aerogel has been created using atomically thin sheets of a substance known as\u0026nbsphexagonal boron nitride. That was carefully engineered into a new material that does not expand outwards when it is compressed or heated up, unlike other similar materials.It then succeeded in a whole host of tests, including experiments that heated and cooled it rapidly. The aerogel hardly changed at all, the authors right, and did not lose any strength.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the Thames Estuary. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” says Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,“ Adeleke says. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.With clubs, churches and motorcycles, Berlin becomes home for migrantsAndrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, says pastors have to juggle retaining the churches’ African identity while appealing to children of first-generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalls speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers says.Reporting by William Schomberg, ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Like many other entrepreneurs, she is spending a lot of time in London, masterminding the expansion of Karma in the UK.\u0026nbspSince it launched in London in February 2018, 80,000 users have signed up to click and collect surplus food from delis and restaurants for half price. On any day, users can browse nearby restaurants and cafes for surplus salads, pastries and full meals to buy and collect before closing.\u0026nbspAll that waste has been good for business: Karma is working with 600 independent retailers in London and makes money by taking a cut of sales. Food waste costs businesses in the UK around\u0026nbsp£20bn annually, according to Wrap, the food waste charity –\u0026nbspthe equivalent of more than £300 per citizen.In September, 90 organisations signed a commitment to reduce food waste through the food chain, from field to fork, by working with suppliers and engaging with customers alike. Supermarkets are increasingly seeing apps as part of the solution.\u0026nbspIn November last year, Karma teamed up with appliance manufacturer Electrolux to test out a smart refrigerator for grocery stores. In a trial in Stockholm, users signed up to buy reduced-price chilled goods that would have otherwise gone to waste, unlocking a connected fridge at the entrance to a supermarket with a QR code.Karma has raised €18m\u0026nbsp(£16m) from investors to expand the number of retailers it works with in London and is planning a test launch in Paris in 2019. But Bernadotte says the app works just as well in small towns with just one or two retailers as it does in big cities. She says: “It’s about matching supply and demand.”It’s also about beating the competition. The number of food waste apps on the market has multiplied in the last decade, fuelled by environmental pressure from consumers and industry bodies. Winnow, which launched in London is 2013, provides chefs in commercial kitchens a set of scales to weigh food and measure how much is thrown away. The app can then assess the value of what is being lost, with the idea that restaurants adapt their menus.\u0026nbspOther apps are based on Bernadotte’s notion of matching supply and demand. Tessa Cook co-founded Olio\u0026nbspin the UK in 2015. The app now connects supply and demand for surplus food within communities in 32 countries, with 75 per cent of food listed picked up within 24 hours.\u0026nbspOlio\u0026nbspcurrently makes money by charging business for its Food Waste Heroes Programme, in which a group of volunteers rescue unsold food from businesses and add it to the app. But its core business is connecting people within communities who may only need one red onion, for example, and have another two to give away. Olio\u0026nbspattracted $6m\u0026nbsp(£4.7m) in Series A funding in July led by Octopus Ventures, which was attracted by the value of connecting people through the app.\u0026nbspKarma’s major competition comes Too Good To Go, an app founded in Copenhagen in 2016. It\u0026nbsphas raised a total of €16m\u0026nbspto expand\u0026nbspin Europe. Too Good To Go founder Mette Lykke knows a thing or two about seeing a gap in the market and scaling a business. She previously co-founded Endomondo, an app for tracking and sharing workouts. It sold to Under Armour for $85m\u0026nbspin 2015.\u0026nbsp“The reality is that it’s standard practice for food businesses to throw away perfectly edible food,” she says. “We give them the flexibility to offer up anything that’s still good to eat and sell it to consumers through the app at a discounted price. It’s a win for retailers, because they reduce waste, acquire customers and increase revenue\u0026nbspit’s a win for consumers who get great food for a reduced price –\u0026nbspand it’s obviously a win for the environment.”In France, Too Good To Go is campaigning for Carrefour, the French retail company, to change its food labels from “best before” to “best before, not bad after”. The campaign comes after Tesco scrapped “best before” labels in the UK in October 2018\u0026nbspon more than 100 products. In its native Denmark, Too Good To Go is also working with the country’s minister for education to create webinars to educate children about how to reduce waste at home.\u0026nbspBut its main business is comes from taking a cut of surplus food sales from restaurants and cafes – with a plan to save 20 million\u0026nbspmeals by the end of 2019. Bernadotte says the main difference between the apps is that Karma users know exactly what food they are picking up, which can help with allergies and dietary requirements. Many of the meals on Too Good To Go are listed as “the magic bag”, a mixed bag of any surplus food that a restaurant might otherwise throw away.\u0026nbspHarriet Jenkins is chief operating officer for Detox Kitchen, a health-food home delivery service that has two delis in London. Detox Kitchen switched from using Too Good To Go to Karma after it was contacted by the latter app when it entered the London market in 2018. “Karma was working with a good number of stores and slightly bigger numbers, so we thought we’d experiment with them,” Jenkins says.6 easy ways to prevent food waste at homeDetox Kitchen had long been interested in reducing food waste in its kitchens, but had found it difficult to strike deals with charities because the delis couldn’t guarantee a set amount of waste to make a worthwhile pickup at the end of the day. Through Karma, they could list as much or as little food for half price to be picked up by customers. In the first week of December last year, Detox Kitchen sold 100 units through Karma, raising £230.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a huge boost to revenue, but it’s not about making money – it’s about not losing money by throwing this stuff away,” Jenkins says. “Anything that is raising the profile of our brand is good for us.”With 700 retailers in London, Karma hasn’t even begun to test the potential of the model, according to Bernadotte. “We started off with restaurants and big hotel chains, and now we’re ramping up with grocery stores, supermarkets and school kitchens,” she says. “I haven’t found anyone who doesn’t have any food waste.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche wrote it for the Richard Gere movie An Officer and A Gentleman. It was sung as a duet after Jennifer Warnes suggested a collaboration with Joe Cocker. Warnes had been a fan of the late Cocker since her teenage years and said she cried out with joy when he accepted the invitation to work with her. Their version was a worldwide hit and also won a Golden Globe and a Grammy.In Swing Time, Fred Astaire sings the gorgeous ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” to Ginger Rogers while she is washing her hair. The sentimental lyrics were written by the brilliant songwriter Dorothy Fields, whose credits include “A Fine Romance” and “The Sunny Side of the Street”. The song, with music composed by Jerome Kern, was up against some terrific competition in 1936 – beating “Pennies from Heaven” and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” to an award in its third year. Billie Holiday, with jazz maestro Teddy Wilson on piano, had a hit with “The Way You Look Tonight” that year and the song has since been recorded by hundreds of best-selling singers, including Frank Sinatra. “The Way You Look Tonight” is popular, romantic songwriting at its very best.Sammy Fain’s formal love ballads epitomised the style of movie music in the 1950s. Fain won the Academy award for best song twice – for “Secret Love”, from the 1953 Doris Day movie Calamity Jane and, two years later, with the title song for Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing. Fain, a trained pianist, started out as song promoter in the 1920s and he was pragmatic about delivering the song studio bosses wanted for this William Holden movie. Fain and lyricist Paul Francis Webster constantly tinkered with the words in “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” to keep 20th Century-Fox happy. The song, performed by The Four Aces on the soundtrack, has remained a favourite of crooners, from Sinatra to Barry Manilow. The song has also been referenced in numerous modern films, including Grease and Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.410 7) “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” (The Lion King 1994)In songwriting terms, it was essentially Elton John v Randy Newman in 1994. Newman was nominated for “Make Up Your Mind” for The Paper and John for three songs from The Lion King (his other nominations were for the songs “The Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata”). “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”, co-written with Tim Rice, was a popular winner and the single sold 11 million copies. Canadian Céline Dion’s power ballad “My Heart Will Go On”, the theme song to James Cameron’s hit film Titanic, has been bought more than 20 million times. “My Heart Will Go On” is the romantic ballad playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embrace at the front of the ill-fated liner that crashed into a iceberg. Dion showed great technical skill coping with the tricky modulations of a song written by James Horner and Will Jennings, while the poignant tin-whistle playing is courtesy of Andrea Corr.Top Gun was virtually completed when Tom Whitlock came up with the lyrics to “Take My Breath Away” as he was driving home from work and mulling on a melody Giorgio Moroder had composed. The agreed they had something good and made a demo to play for director Tony Scott. He called back Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis to shoot some new love scenes to go with the new song. “If you see those scenes, you\u0027ll notice that they are lit differently and there are those gauzy curtains blowing around,” Whitlock told rediscoverthe80s “All of that was to disguise that some months had gone by and the actors didn\u0027t look exactly the same.”710 4) “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (The Woman in Red, 1984)In 1984, another year of popular movie title songs (“Ghostbusters” and “Footloose” were in the running), the Oscar went to Stevie Wonder’s “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. Wonder said that he had the late John Lennon in mind for a song he claimed he had first thought of in 1976. “I had the melody and lyric for the chorus, and I imagined in my mind when hearing the chords that The Beatles were singing with me. And that idea and feeling is what inspired me to use the vocoder.” The song was written for the movie The Woman in Red, a mediocre comedy starring Gene Wilder. In 2018, singer-songwriter John Prine recorded a slow, stripped-down version of the song for Spotify Singles, in which he brings out the essential charm of a ballad some find too saccharine. Wonder’s winner was a particular favourite of the writer Maya Angelou810 3) “Moon River” (Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 1961)In Blake Edwards’s film of the Truman Capote novel Breakfast at Tiffany’s, there is a scene in which the love interest Audrey Hepburn sits on the fire escape at a New York apartment and accompanies herself on guitar singing “Moon River”. The scene is charming and the waif-like Hepburn, staying in tune and doing her best with a singing voice that was thin and limited in range, delivers a moving version of a song written for her by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.The film noir Captain Carey, U.S.A, a tale of revenge set in the aftermath of the Second World War that starred Alan Ladd, is regarded now as a dated dud. Its theme tune “Mona Lisa”, sung by Ukrainian jazz trumpeter and bandleader Charlie Spivak, is the surviving glory of the film, however. It became a global hit when it was covered in 1950 by Nat King Cole. Ray Evans wrote the poignant lyrics – “Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa? Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?” – and realised the song, comparing a lover to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, would work as a showcase for Cole’s warm baritone voice. Cole’s splendid version was at No.1 for eight weeks. In the year it won, incidentally, “Mona Lisa” beat the Disney novelty song “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” from Cinderella.1010  1) “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz, 1939)Although “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” is not a straightforward love song, it is a ballad about hope and loving humanity itself, a song that co-writer Yip Harburg called an attempt to “create a rainbow world”, where the dreams you dare to dream really do come true. It was the song Ariana Grande picked to perform at the ‘One Love Manchester’ concert in 2017 for the victims of the terrorist attack. Remarkably, this 20th-century classic, whose melody was composed by Harold Arlen, was almost cut from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, because MGM were worried that the opening Kansas sequence was too long. Sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s sublime version, orchestrated by Murray Cutter, wowed cinema-goers and the decision to leave it in was vindicated. Lady Gaga sings a brief section of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star is Born.110 10) “Up Where We Belong (An Officer and A Gentleman, 1982)1982 was a year of blockbuster movie songs and “Up Where We Belong” pipped “Eye of the Tiger” to Oscars glory.

or\u0026nbspembarrassment\u0026nbspcaused.\u0026nbspThey said: An online exchange, primarily concerned with issues irrelevant to the Polish student community in the UK, caused concerns that the panel debate would be overshadowed by issues specific to internal British political controversies, however topical.We strongly deny the charges of stifling free speech, let alone censorship. We are deeply committed to free speech and consider it to be an important part of our identity as a student body.The organisers added that Mr Kasprzyk, a Liberal Democrat and a vocal supporter of the Remain campaign, was invited to\u0026nbsprepresent the opposing\u0026nbspviews to Mr Kawczynski.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Sally Field for Places in the HeartSally Field set the bar high for self-congratulations with her infamous Best Actress acceptance speech in 1985. Often misquoted as “You like me, you really like me,” Field actually said: “I can’t deny the fact that you like me, right now, you like me!” The look-at-me sentiment was clear and the catchphrase would last in the public memory longer than most of her films. Luckily, Field saw the funny side of things, repeating the line in a commercial for Charles Schwab bank in 2000.210 Gwyenth Paltrow for Shakespeare in LoveGwyneth Paltrow’s weepy Best Actress acceptance speech for 1998’s Shakespeare in Love is often held up as the epitome of awards season schmaltz. On the verge of tears from the get-go, Paltrow trembled with emotion as she sobbed her way through a long list of collaborators and loved ones. The full-bore sentimentality of it left some viewers doubting her sincerity. Others simply felt sorry for Paltrow, who was clear unable to hold it together.310 Sean Penn for Mystic RiverSean Penn, picking up his first Best Actor award in 2004, opened with a joke about the missing Iraqi WMDs. The quip garnered unimpressed silence, with the audience remaining quiet as Penn proceeded to thank a long, scattershot list of collaborators. At least he remembered to credit Robin Wright, then his wife – a mention he neglected to give five years later when he won again for Milk.410 Sam Smith for SpectreSam Smith caused a stir when he accepted his award for Best Original Song “Writing’s On the Wall”, which he co-wrote with Jimmy Napes for the Bond flick in 2016. Smith later admitted he was drunk when he made the erroneous claim that “no openly gay man had ever won an Oscar” before him. The crooner had misinterpreted a fact given to him by Sir Ian McKellen, who was referring specifically to the acting categories. In fact, the Best Song category alone features both Elton John and Stephen Sondheim as prior winners. Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, who won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Milk in 2009, quickly called him out on his blunder. The pop singer later apologised.   510 Anne Hathaway for Les MiserablesAnne Hathaway’s Best Supporting Actress win in 2012 was seen as inevitable. However, in the run-up to the Oscars, the actor’s appeal began to wane thanks to her controversial comments on weight loss, and her admission that she had cried watching herself perform on screen. Accepting the award, Hathaway began by excitedly muttering “it came true” – a mawkish gesture that epigraphed a speech that many viewers found insincere and over-rehearsed.610 Jack Palance for City SlickersJack Palance was 73 years old when he accepted the Best Supporting Actor award in 1992. After remarking on the producers’ supposed concerns about his age, he dropped to the floor and started performing one-armed push-ups. While the crowd cheered, he looked ridiculous, and the bawdy jokes that followed did little to help. To his credit, Palance would keep acting for over a decade afterwards.710 Matthew McConaughey for Dallas Buyers ClubMatthew McConaughey’s journey from middling rom-com star to Hollywood A-lister – dubbed “the Mcconaissance” – reached its apex in 2014 when the Dazed and Confused star collected the Best Actor award for his charismatic turn in Jean-Marc Vallée’s film. McConaughey began by thanking God, going on to talk about his “hero” – a person whom he must “chase.” Turns out, McConaughey was talking about himself in ten years’ time. Even dropping in his signature catchphrase “alright, alright, alright” wasn’t enough to tie up the strange and egotistical speech that left the audience baffled.810 Roberto Benigni for Life is BeautifuAlthough English may not be Roberto Benigni’s first language, there’s no accounting for some of the expressions he used during his 1999 acceptance speech. Having beaten Hollywood megastar Tom Hanks, nominated for Saving Private Ryan, the eccentric Italian gave an animated speech, which included the strange line: “I would like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making love to everybody.”910 Melissa Leo for The FighterHaving built a respected career as a character actor, Melissa Leo finally gained mainstream recognition when she won Best Supporting Actress in 2010, at the age of 50. Leo had personally funded Hollywood trade ads for her Oscar campaign. And while they worked a treat, her speech didn’t follow suit. She started by flirting with a 94-year-old Kirk Douglas, before deploying both an accidental F-bomb and a gushing thank-you to the Academy. To top it off, Leo left the stage stooped over, using Douglas’ walking stick.1010 George C Scott for PattonIn 1971, George C Scott became the first actor to ever refuse an Oscar. Writing to the Academy, Scott said he objected to the notion of actors being in competition with one another, calling the whole ceremony a “meat parade.” Producer Frank McCarthy, who accepted the award in Scott’s absence, seemingly missed the memo and gave a speech generously praising the Academy.110 Sally Field for Places in the HeartSally Field set the bar high for self-congratulations with her infamous Best Actress acceptance speech in 1985.

I think people should be forgiven for their sins. Our life is so challenging. How do you ever make amends?”Grammar added that, should Frasier return, he doesn\u0027t want the character to still be living in the same Seattle apartment and thinks the show should focus on his son, Frederick.“He\u0027s the place where we can have a nugget of surprise.

This beautiful axehead was found in the Scottish Borders\u0026nbspbut it’s not from Scotland, it’s from central Europe – and it’s been here for 6,000 years.Several floors above, in the museum’s revamped East Asia galleries, curators from a range of countries are celebrating a landmark in the museum’s history. After 15 years, the £80m\u0026nbspoverhaul of this historic institution is finally complete. The project was completed on time\u0026nbspand on budget. The museum’s 29 galleries look magnificent. By any measure, it’s been a spectacular success. More than two million people visit the\u0026nbspmuseum every year, making it Britain’s most popular visitor attraction outside London – not bad for a venue in a city with a population of half a million, and in a country with a population of just five million. However, this relaunch comes at a critical time in Scotland’s national history. When this redevelopment began, in 2004, who would have thought it would be completed just as Scotland braces itself to leave the EU?In case anyone needs reminding (and it seems quite a lot of English voters do), Scots voted to remain in the European Union in 2016, by a considerably larger margin than they voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014. According to English Brexiteers, this “will of the people”\u0026nbspdoesn’t count because Scotland is merely part of the UK, rather than a distinct and separate country – and in a narrow\u0026nbsplegalistic sense they’re right. But as you wander around this museum, which charts the history of the Scottish nation and its relationship with the wider world beyond the British Isles, you realise there’s nothing eternal or automatic about Scotland’s place within the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBrexit putting the union at risk, new poll revealsThe history of the National Museum of Scotland\u0026nbspmirrors Scotland’s shifting relationship with Great Britain over the past few hundred years. The museum’s roots stretch back to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, founded in 1780, at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment, when Edinburgh, then as now, was a European cultural and intellectual hub.In 1861\u0026nbspthe current building was erected here in Chambers Street. Prince Albert laid the foundation stone. Originally called the Industrial Museum of Scotland, it was the UK’s first national museum outside London. The central atrium, flooded with natural light, was inspired by London’s Crystal Palace, where Albert staged his Great Exhibition in 1851. The museum’s mission was “to bring Scotland to the world, and the world to Scotland”.\u0026nbspThat mission statement held true in 1861 – it still holds true today.Over the next century, this museum was renamed several times. It was the Edinburgh Museum of Science and\u0026nbspArt, and then the Royal Scottish Museum, before finally becoming the National Museum of Scotland in 1985. In 1998\u0026nbspa modern wing was added to the original Victorian building, and since 2004 the Victorian building has been undergoing an enormous renovation programme. Now finally, after 15 years, that renovation is complete.So is this the\u0026nbspend of the story, the conclusion of a process which began back in 1780? Hardly. A stroll around this museum confirms that history is always unfinished business – particularly here in Scotland, in a national museum in a country which hasn’t been an independent nation for more than 300 years. For visitors, from Britain and abroad, this ambiguous status begs the question: what is the purpose of a national museum in a land that is not (yet) a nation? Is it a sop to rebellious Scots, to appease their nationalist ambitions? Or is it a cultural harbinger of full independence – a sign of things to come?As these displays remind us, England and Scotland have shared a monarch since 1603, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English crown from the childless Queen Elizabeth I. What’s less widely known – outside Scotland, at least – is that the Scottish parliament stumbled on for another century, until the Act of Union in 1707. Since the foundation of the Scottish parliament, just down the road from here, in 1999, Scotland is back where it was in the 17th century –\u0026nbspa country with its own parliament\u0026nbspbut subservient to Westminster. A century from now, will Scotland be independent again?Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadScotland isn’t the only European nation within a nation, and several of these quasi-nations have their own national museums. Their respective histories reveal a good deal about these statelets’ differing attitudes to independence. The Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich was founded in 1855\u0026nbspby King Maximilian II of Bavaria, when the region was still an independent nation. Bavaria voted for union with the Deutsches Reich in 1871, and has remained part of Germany ever since, yet it retains many of the cultural trappings of a nation state, including this national museum. A significant minority of Bavarians still pine for a return to statehood (a YouGov poll in 2017, at the height of the refugee crisis, put the number as high as 32 per cent), but as immigration falls it looks as if these separatist ambitions have peaked.Conversely, the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, in Barcelona, reflects far stronger independence aspirations. Despite its long history as an independent country, Catalonia has been part of Spain since 1715, and until 2004 the Palau Nacional in Barcelona merely housed the Museu d’Art de Catalunya. In 2004 it was renamed the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, and in 2017, when Catalonia held an (illegal) independence referendum, the Palau Nacional was a popular focal point for pro-independence demonstrations.At present, Scottish independence seems to sit somewhere between these two positions. In 2014 Scots voted to remain in the UK, by 55.3 per cent\u0026nbspto 44.7\u0026nbspper cent, but Scotland’s subsequent vote to remain in the EU, by 62 per cent\u0026nbspto 38 per cent, puts the Scottish parliament on a collision course with Westminster. The National Museum of Scotland is careful not to take sides in these isive debates. They don’t need to. The exhibits speak for themselves. Scotland may leave the EU\u0026nbspand may remain in the UK, but the contents of this museum show Scotland has always been a European country, as much as a British one.Entering the wing of the museum\u0026nbspdevoted to Scottish history, you’re confronted by a cri de coeur from Robert the Bruce: “As long as one hundred of us remain alive, we will never on any conditions be brought under English rule.”\u0026nbspOn the opposite wall is a similarly stirring pronouncement from the Declaration of Arbroath (the letter the barons of Scotland sent to Pope John XXII in 1320, confirming Scotland’s independence, and its right to resist the English by force): “For we fight not for glory nor riches nor honours, but for freedom alone, which no good man gives up except with his life.”For an English visitor in particular, what is unfamiliar (and instructive) about this display is the pan-European focus, and the refreshing absence of Anglo-centric emphasis. You realise that, for long periods of its history, Scotland’s relationship with England was nothing special. The Romans occupied all of England for several centuries and left a lasting mark upon it. Their partial incursions into Scotland were short and insubstantial. During the dark ages, Scotland enjoyed closer links with Ireland than England. As the old Roman roads crumbled away, it became far easier for Scots to sail to Ireland than to trek to England. The Irish Sea wasn’t a barrier\u0026nbspbut a busy highway.There was nothing inevitable or preordained about the Act of Union in 1707. Like a lot of historical turning points, it owed a good deal to happenstance. At the end of the 17th century, despite having shared the same monarch for almost 100 years, the Kingdom of Scotland was still independent. And with better luck and better judgement it might well have remained so. If only the Scottish government hadn’t invested a quarter of Scotland’s wealth in a new colony in Panama, it might still be independent today.Like a lot of heroic failures, the idea was inspired. By establishing a base in Panama, on the isthmus between North and South America, Scotland would control the growing trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic, anticipating the Panama canal by 200 years. Mindful of the Romans, and the new empire they hoped to build, they called this new colony Caledonia.If Caledonia had been successful, Scotland might have become a world power, with no need of England. However, the English government did its best to scupper the venture, colluding with the East India Company in a trade blockade. The colony collapsed, sparking a financial crisis\u0026nbspin Edinburgh. If anything, the collapse in national confidence was even more severe. Seven years later the Scottish parliament voted narrowly for union with England – and that was the end of the Scottish parliament\u0026nbspuntil 1999.Of course this isn’t new information, but it’s a shock to English eyes to see it presented here so prominently, and so starkly, rather than buried in the footnotes of a dry and dusty history book. I studied this stuff when I did my history degree, but I never knew about the £20,000 in bribes the English paid to Scottish politicians to push the Act of Union through the Scottish parliament, and vote for their own extinction. In the light of this betrayal, the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 make a lot more sense.Hunting with dogs to be ‘effectively halted’ in Scotland Women win equal pay dispute after 12-year battle with Glasgow councilCross-party rally calls for second referendum in ScotlandThe top floor of the museum is devoted to Scotland in the 20th century. The exhibition Scotland:\u0026nbspA Changing Nation is a vivid picture of where Scotland stands today. Here you’ll find Jimmy Reid, the Scottish trade unionist, and Winifred Ewing, the pioneering SNP politician. Here you’ll find Margaret Thatcher, opining that:\u0026nbsp“We English, who are a marvellous people, are really very generous to Scotland.”\u0026nbspThe display lets you draw your own conclusions. The exhibition concludes with the opening of the Scottish parliament, designed by the Catalan architect Enric Miralles. “We have a building which is more than a building,”\u0026nbspsaid the Scots poet Edwin Morgan, and he’s right.So what does the rebirth of this museum tell us about the rebirth of Scottish nationalism? This museum isn’t a nationalistic project, as its curators are at pains to point out. The National Museum of Scotland is devoutly, resolutely apolitical. It flies no flag for any party. Yet Scottish politics has flowed in a very different direction since 1998\u0026nbspwhen this museum was last expanded: an independence referendum (defeated) an EU membership referendum (won in Scotland\u0026nbspbut lost across the UK, thanks to Brexit votes in England)\u0026nbspand a resurrected Scottish parliament, reconvened after 200 years.In party politics, the biggest story by far has been the rise of the Scottish National Party, now the governing party here in Scotland. These have been seismic changes, and though this museum’s impartiality is admirable, it wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t reflect this tectonic shift.The internationalism of this museum, and the growing internationalism of Scotland, is reflected in this museum’s perspective, and the nationalities of its staff. The three curators I spoke to, entirely at random, were Chinese, French and German. Time was, talent tended to drift south from Scotland. Now, increasingly, it’s the other way around. The museum’s director, Dr Gordon Rintoul,\u0026nbspis a Scot who returned to Scotland from England.“We’ve certainly attracted a substantial number of people from outside Scotland, and I think people have come here because they sense an opportunity to do something different, an opportunity to make a difference,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. His curator of Chinese collections, Dr Qin Cao, is a case in point. Originally from China, she worked in London and Oxford before she relocated to Edinburgh. “It is a very vibrant place,”\u0026nbspshe says.“We have so many visitors coming from all over the world,”\u0026nbspsays Friederike Voigt, a senior curator\u0026nbspwho was born and raised in Germany. “In a way what makes Scotland great is the same thing that makes this museum great,”\u0026nbspsays Dr Xavier Dectot, keeper of art and\u0026nbspdesign at the musuem, who comes from France. I know what he means. It’s big enough, but it’s small enough. People feel connected here.“There’s a greater awareness that we’re actually dependent on other people, so we want to interact,”\u0026nbspadds Voigt. “It’s very outward looking,”\u0026nbspconcurs Dectot. “Not only do we feel Scottish, but the other Scots don’t perceive us as anything but Scots.”\u0026nbspIf only this were true in England.“A large part of what defines the architecture of this city is late 18th century – neoclassical – that’s something that is very European,”\u0026nbspsays Dectot, who personifies Scotland’s Auld Alliance\u0026nbspwith France, and its cultural affinity with the continent. And now the street life is catching up. The city always used to feel cosmopolitan in August\u0026nbspduring Edinburgh\u0026nbspFestival Fringe. Now it feels cosmopolitan all year round. “Everyone in the city has responded to that,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. “That does actually give the city a more international feel.”Scottish devolution has had a direct effect on the evolution of this museum. “A key point for this project was the strong support from Scottish government,”\u0026nbspRintoul tells me. It doesn’t hurt that the Scottish parliament, in Holyrood, is just a short walk\u0026nbspfrom the museum. “It’s clearly easier to argue your case.”\u0026nbspIt’s also clearly easier to secure public funding when the public keep coming in such numbers. The museum’s recent Mary Queen of Scots and Bonnie Prince Charlie exhibitions were both hugely popular. Their popularity reveals a growing appetite for Scottish heritage, particularly for shows like these, which re-evaluate the mythic elements of Scotland’s past.There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago“Since the time of devolution there’s been\u0026nbspmuch increased interest in Scotland’s history. There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago.”Although Edinburgh feels more international now, Scots internationalism is nothing new. “Scots have always engaged with the rest of the world. These galleries, throughout the whole museum, are replete with items that were acquired by Scots who were abroad, as missionaries\u0026nbspor to seek their fortune\u0026nbspor in military service, and bringing things back to Scotland.”Speaking personally, as a Londoner who’s spent more time in Edinburgh than in any city outside London, I grow to love Scotland more with every visit, but I also become more and more aware of how different it is from England. Without Brexit, the National Museum of Scotland might have remained what it has been for more than a century – an expression of national identity for a nation within a nation – a Bavarian model, if you like. After Brexit, it looks destined to become the focal point for a more Catalan model, whether these curators like it or not. What an exquisite irony that the Conservative and\u0026nbspUnionist Party, of all parties, has brought the Act of Union to its current crisis point! What a fascinating exhibition that will make, in 20 or 30 years to come.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Next, the group are expected to test the drag sail part of the test on 12 March.\u0026nbsp“Successful in-space demonstration of the harpoon technology is a significant step towards solving the growing issue of space debris, said Chris Burgess, Harpoon Lead Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.Professor Guglielmo Aglietti, director of the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey, added: “This is RemoveDEBRIS’ most demanding experiment and the fact that it was a success is testament to all involved.\u0026nbspThe RemoveDEBRIS project provides strong evidence of what can be achieved with the power of collaboration – pooling together the experience across industry and the research field to achieve something truly remarkable.”Additional reporting from agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.420 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 720 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1020 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 1920 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.420 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 720 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1020 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics.

Further votes may take place the following day.However many, including Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, believe Ms May\u0026nbspis planning to delay the meaningul vote until after the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 March, even if an extension to the Article 50 deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspis offered.Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is in those final days that we have the biggest chance to convince MPs to give this decision back to the public.”What will the march be demanding?The key demand is that\u0026nbspany Brexit deal should be put to a public vote for final approval.“Instead of letting Theresa May kick the can down the road until the March 29 deadline, hundreds of thousands of people will march on parliament offering a solution to a crisis that threatens our rights, our living standards and our environment,” said former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.One proposal for avoiding a no-deal Brexit and securing a second referendum involves tabling\u0026nbspan amendment\u0026nbspin the last week before 29 March.MPs would then approve her deal only if it was subject to a public vote.Where\u0026nbspwill the march take place?The march is set to begin at 12pm, or “high noon”, on Saturday 23 March, on London’s Park Lane.Organisers from the People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbsphave not yet released full details of the route but the march is due to end at Parliament Square with a “mass rally and keynote speeches”.Who will be joining the march?Several leading politicians\u0026nbspincluding Caroline Lucas,\u0026nbspDavid Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Conservative MP Anna Soubry, and the leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, have already confirmed their support.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspis supporting the march and encouraging readers to attend.The organisers are hoping to widen their appeal beyond those who have previously supported the People’s Vote and Final Say campaigns.\u0026nbspThe Independent‘s petition calling on the prime minister to give the people a final say on Brexit has attracted well over 1.1 million sigantures.“The only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a People’s Vote,” said Sir Vince.For more details about the Put It To The People march\u0026nbsp– and to sign up – please visit\u0026nbsppeoples-vote.ukmarchFor updates on what’s going on with Brexit, you can register here to receive our new Brexit in Brief newsletter and other benefits.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.One leading Tory described the night as a “fiasco”, Jeremy Corbyn said the country was heading for a “catastrophe”, and a senior source in Brussels said: “There goes the strong mandate.”The Brexit fault line also cut through Mr Corbyn’s party on Thursday, with a significant number of Labour MPs apparently defying their leader’s will in a separate vote\u0026nbspamid suspicions that some are close to breaking away.Corbyn suffers revolt as 41 Labour MPs back ‘immediate’ Brexit delayBut the spotlight was firmly on the prime minister’s ailing administration as it contorted in an attempt to avoid defeat on what did not have to be a difficult night for Ms May.The wording of Thursday’s motion called on MPs to reiterate their support for the approach set out in an earlier set of votes on 29 January, when the Commons backed a plan to reopen negotiations with Brussels on the withdrawal agreement –\u0026nbspbut also voted for a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit.After the government apparently combined\u0026nbspsupport for both issues in Thursday’s motion, rather than just focussing on renegotiating with the EU, Tory Euroceptics who want to keep no deal on the table found themselves unable to back Ms May’s position.It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness createdGovernment whips tried and failed in the hours running up to the vote\u0026nbspto convince Brexiteers that backing the government on Thursday would not take no deal off the table.After the defeat, prominent Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin MP said: “It’s an unfortunate fiasco that the government’s clumsiness created.“I don’t know why the government doesn’t consult a bit more widely before they table these motions. There are 110 Eurosceptic Tory MPs who helped defeat the withdrawal agreement – not one of us was consulted.”The ision list showed the government’s Brexit motion was supported by 243 of Ms\u0026nbspMay’s MPs.\u0026nbspWhile just five of them voted against it, many Tories in the\u0026nbspBrexit-backing\u0026nbspEuropean Research Group (ERG) abstained, robbing Ms May of her majority.Steve Baker, vice-chair of the ERG, said its members were not prepared to be “coopted into taking no deal off the table”, but he insisted that Ms May retains “a clear mandate” from last month’s vote to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.He said: “It’s time for some people to grow up and think about what is in the national interest.\u0026nbspThat is standing firm that we are leaving and then negotiating with the EU to get an acceptable deal.”Mr Corbyn demanded the prime minister come back to the chamber with a “coherent plan” following the defeat, claiming the vote showed there is no majority for her course of action.He went on: “The government cannot keep on ignoring parliament or ploughing on towards 29\u0026nbspMarch without a coherent plan.“She can’t keep on just running down the clock and hoping that something will turn up that will save her day and save her face.”A Downing Street spokesman accused Mr Corbyn of putting “partisan considerations” ahead of the national interest and voting in a way to make a no-deal scenario more likely.He added: “While we didn’t secure the support of the Commons this evening, the prime minister continues to believe, and the debate itself indicated, that far from objecting to securing changes to the backstop that will allow us to leave with a deal, there was a concern from some Conservative colleagues about taking no deal off the table at this stage.The spokesman said the government will now continue to seek legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to secure Britain’s departure from the EU on 29 March.But the defeat does not bode well for a more significant set of votes coming on 27 February, when parliament could well use Commons amendments to take control of the process away from Ms May and delay\u0026nbspBrexit.Pro-Europe Tory\u0026nbspAnna Soubry\u0026nbspsaid: “This is a serious blow to the credibility of the prime minister. We are in such a mess, I’m afraid, that parliament is going to have to take back control of this.“It is a symbol of the profound lack of leadership in both political parties.”Mr Corbyn also suffered a major revolt when dozens of his own MPs backed an\u0026nbspSNP\u0026nbspcall for an “immediate” move to delay Brexit by extending\u0026nbspArticle 50.The Labour leader had ordered his MPs to abstain – but he was defied by 41 who voted with the Scottish Nationalists for a suspension of “no fewer than three months”, past 29 March.We’ll tell you what’s true.

You said that ‘policy will be made by Labour members, not the leader, shadow cabinet or parliamentary party’.You said that ‘policy will be made by Labour members, not the leader, shadow cabinet or parliamentary party’. Yet the complete opposite now appears to be happening“Yet the complete opposite now appears to be happening. I am sure you can appreciate our confusion and dissatisfaction with the current situation.“Based on the content of your letter to the prime minister, not only is the policy not now being followed, it has clearly been changed – but without any mandate from the party membership to do so.\u0026nbsp How is this ‘Straight Talking, Honest Politics’?”The delegates say they are a group made up of both long-standing members and others who were inspired to join the party by Mr Corbyn himself.But with 29 March fast approaching, they warn that time is running out and emphasise that Labour’s efforts to secure an election have not been successful, and that the only remaining option is a new referendum.They add: “The vast majority of the membership want a referendum on the deal. If we are truly a member led party, then all elements of the Brexit policy must be adhered to.“There are no more options on the table other than calling for a referendum on the PM’s deal.”A spokesman at party headquarters said: “The Labour Party is faithfully following our policy on Brexit.A source in the leaders office argued that Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn\u0027s five demands to Theresa May were consistent with Labour\u0027s\u0026nbspconference policy, a Labour\u0026nbspamendment put down in the commons on 29 January and Sir Keir\u0027s six tests.What have world leaders said about Brexit?Corbyn suffers revolt as 41 Labour MPs back \u0027immediate\u0027 Brexit delayMay suffers embarrassing defeat as Tories rebel over no-deal BrexitOn Thursday, shadow treasury spokesman Clive Lewis MP, on the party’s left wing, broke ranks to criticise the Labour leadership for its “dangerous” failure to oppose Ms May’s exit plan full-on – warning it would keep the party out of power.“My fear is that what we are now doing is that we are helping to facilitate a Tory Brexit,” he told a meeting of Labour supporters in Westminster.Inside the commons chamber shortly after, pro-EU MP Chris Leslie, from the party’s right wing, gave a heavily critical speech on the leader’s position.He pointed out that the words giving the commitment to an “option of a public vote” were absent from Mr Corbyn’s proposed amendment in parliament, adding: “I ask myself why are we regressing when it comes to our party’s policy, as passed at the September conference.”Mr Leslie said he found it “heartbreaking” that the party was not fully opposing the Conservative plans for Brexit, and that frontbenchers were abstaining in key votes.He went on: “On this particular issue, we are being played for fools by the leadership of the Labour party.“By now, we should have reached the stage of a public vote on the option of remaining in the European Union.”On the same day rumours swirled that some Labour MPs were about to announce that they would break from the opposition whip and form a new party.Though it was denied and a break is yet to have materialised, the rumour persists and many expect it to happen at some point in the near future.On Wednesday Neil Coyle MP claimed the party was losing members and councillors, and could yet lose MPs over its Brexit policy, while Wavertree MP Luciana Berger has said young voters would see the party as “standing in the way” of them having a say unless it backed a new referendum.Earlier in the week, there were further signs of ision at the top of the party when the leader’s spokesman was forced to reiterate that pushing for a new election is the Labour’s preference after Sir Keir indicated that a compromise deal or a new referendum were the “only credible options now left”.The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for a fresh public vote through its Final Say campaign, with\u0026nbspmore than 1.1 million people having signed the petition.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Responsibility for the attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a group that operates out of Pakistan and was founded by Masood Azhar.India on Friday claimed it had “incontrovertible evidence” Pakistan had a “direct hand” in the attack. Finance minister Arun Jaitley said India would initiate “all possible diplomatic steps” to “ensure the complete isolation from the international community of Pakistan, of which incontrovertible evidence is available of having a direct hand in this gruesome terrorist incident”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Pulwama attack: India and Pakistan clash over Kashmir bombing Show all 4Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Indian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Indian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack He said India was to strip Pakistan of its “most favoured nation status” , a move that reportedly increased tariffs on Pakistani goods\u0026nbspby 200 per cent.Pakistan has denied it had any role in Thursday’s attack and accused India of pointing the finger of blame without conducting a proper investigation. Pakistan’s foreign secretary Tehmina Janjua said in a statement after meeting foreign ambassadors, there was: “A familiar Indian pattern of immediate and reflexive assignment of blame on Pakistan without investigations.”Pakistan has long been accused of harbouring militant groups the nation’s military historically saw as part of its defence against India. Over the years, its intelligence forces have supplied weapons and logistical support to militants to carry out cross-border attacks in Kashmir, a long-disputed region that each country lays claim to and controls part of it.In recent years, Pakistan has said it has dropped its support for such militants, despite its failure to bring to justice figures such as Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that left more than 160 people dead.Just how to control such militants is a major challenge for prime minister Imran Khan, who was elected last year. Many believe the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, won the election with at least the tacit approval of the country’s powerful military, making it harder for him to crack down on militants that may have links to the armed forces or intelligence services.Tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed nations which have gone to four on four occasions since the two nations secured their independence from Britain in 1947, have worsened in the days since the attack, despite Islamabad’s insistence it had nothing to do with it.The situation is made more challenging by the fact India is due to hold a general election in May, heaping pressure on India’s prime minister Narendra Modi,\u0026nbspas his country looks to how he responds to the attack, the deadliest of its kind in years.India says Pakistan had ‘direct hand’ in Kashmir bomb attackIndia warns Pakistan of ‘jaw-breaking reply’ after suicide bomb attackWhat is Kashmir Solidarity Day and how is it observed?Kashmir rocked by violence as civilians are shot following protests18 hour gun battle ends with three dead in KashmirOver the weekend, the bodies of members of the central reserve police force killed in the bombing, were returned to villages and towns across the country for funeral rites.“I want to tell the terrorist organisations and their supporters that have made a huge mistake,” Mr Modi said on Friday. “They will have to pay a very heavy cost for this. I give assurance to the nation that the forces behind the attack, the culprits behind this attack – they will definitely be punished for their actions.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The criticism was not just one way.\u0026nbspAngela Merkel\u0026nbspwarned of the dangers in American isolationism and staunchly defended multilateral institutions under threat from US policy.The German chancellor defended the Iran deal, condemning Mr Trump’s decision to withdraw from it, and questioned his decision to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. Ms Merkel also rebuffed US demands that her government scrap a gas deal with Moscow under which a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, being built under the Baltic, will bring Russian gas directly to Germany.She highlighted a statement by a\u0026nbspUS official that German cars were a security threat to America, to show the attitude to trade held by some in Washington. “We are proud of our cars and so we should be ... If it is viewed as a security threat to the United States then we are shocked,”\u0026nbspsaid Ms Merkel, adding that many were manufactured in the US and exported to countries like China.Warning of attacks on international organisations of the type Mr Trump is in the habit of making, Ms Merkel commented: “We cannot just smash it, we need to cooperate ... Now that we see pressure on the classic order we are used to, the question now is, ‘Do we fall apart into pieces of a puzzle and think everyone can solve the question best for himself alone?’”.It would be wiser, she said, “to put yourself in the others’ shoes ... and see whether we can get win-win solutions together”.Germany is among international powers –\u0026nbspalong with Britain, France, Russia and China – which signed the nuclear agreement with Tehran. All these countries, as well as the UN Atomic Energy Authority, stress that the deal was working in preventing Iran developing a nuclear arsenal and that Tehran was abiding by its obligations.European countries have organised a payment mechanism under which businesses and banks would, in theory, be able to trade with Iran without incurring American sanctions. Mike Pence said: “The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and join with us as we bring the economic and diplomatic pressure. The time has come for our European partners to stop undermining US sanctions against this murderous revolutionary regime.”When Mr Pence went on to accuse Iran of sponsoring terrorism\u0026nbspthere were some whispered comments among some in the room about Gulf states, which are major purchasers of American arms, funding extremist Islamist groups. There were also sotto voce comments about the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi for which officials close to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, an American ally close to Mr Kushner, have\u0026nbspbeen blamed.Mr Pence is part of the largest American delegation ever sent to the Munich conference. It includes senior Democrats like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi who are vocal critics of Mr Trump. Mr Biden is expected to criticise current US policy in a number of fields, including foreign policy, when he speaks at a session.It was not surprising, in this acrimonious atmosphere, to hear the Russian foreign minister\u0026nbspSergei Lavrov\u0026nbspround on the west for a catalogue of alleged wrongdoing past and present, from the “illegal bombing of Serbia” and “organising a coup in Kiev” to the “aggressive” stance being taken by western politicians.British defence secretary\u0026nbspGavin Williamson, who had attacked Russia in a speech at the conference on Friday for its role in a number of conflicts, got a special mention. “If you listen to some people like the minister of war – sorry the minister of defence – of the United Kingdom then you might get an impression that nobody except Nato has\u0026nbspthe right to be anywhere,” said Mr Lavrov.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So British workers, who earn an average of £, a year, are each getting richer by £ a week, every week.Not that you may have heard the good news on inflation and real wages.As ever, it was drowned out by the relentless drone of bad news stories, all trying to convince us that Britain is in an economic crash, caused by Brexit.In this fictional version of Britain’s economic health we are all getting poorer. Factories are closing like never before and jobs are drting away to the rest of the EU.Yesterday, for example, thegave prominence to a claim by a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, that Brexit is already costing us £million a week.It was fantasy, based on Mr Vlieghe’s guess that the economy would have been two per cent larger had we not voted to leave the EU.Why should anyone believe him when the Bank of England’s economic forecasters have such a terrible record A month before the  referendum, the bank’s governor, Mark Carney, predicted Britain could fall into a “technical recession”we voted to leave.It didn’t happen — or even come close to happening.Then on Wednesday, Carney stunned many with a speech saying Brexit could usher in a golden era of “international co-operation and crossborder commerce” and even that it could be a springboard to a “new global order” of free trade.It is true that economic growth in Britain is sluggish by historical standards, but then it has been ever since the economic crash of  .But at . per cent growth in the past three months, it is outpacing Germany, where the economy was static over the same period. Italy is in recession.It is more than six years since Britain saw the economy shrink over the course of three months, and more than nine years since the economy shrank by more than two quarters in a row — the official definition of a recession.We might not be booming, in other words, but we have gone a remarkably long period without a bust.As for jobs, the unemployment rate has fallen to four per cent — the lowest since the first three months of .Employment, however, is far higher than it was then.We are in the middle of a jobs miracle, yet you would never guess this from listening to many news bulletins.Last week, we never heard the end of it when Nissan announced that it would not, after all, be building its new X-Trail model in Sunderland. You had to read a little more deeply to realise that not a single job is being lost at Britain’s Nissan plants and that the X-Trail is only being dropped because European consumers have turned against diesel.In France, by the way, the unemployment rate is . per cent and in Italy it is . per cent. So much for the notion that the Eurozone economy is powering ahead while Brexit Britain lags behind.Ever since the referendum, the economy has defied the doom-mongers. The past month has been no exception.The High Street was predicted to be a bloodbath. Yet several large chains, including Next, Dunelm and Pets At Home, reported strongly rising sales in the weeks up to Christmas.We have continued shopping after Christmas, too. Consumer spending in January was . per cent higher than a year earlier, according to Barclaycard.The stock market and housing market have both failed to crash, as many predicted they would. In fact, the FTSE  is up seven per cent this year.House prices, according to the Government’s index, are up . per cent over the past  months. That’s no rampant boom, but it is certainly nowhere near a crash.The one thing on which economists were right was that the Pound would fall after a Brexit vote.It is  per cent lower than in early .That is bad newsyou are going on a foreign holiday. Butyou have a job in a company which exports goods or services, it is a pretty good thing.By increasing exports and decreasing imports, the lower Pound is helping to reduce Britain’s trade deficit.In  we imported £billion more in goods and services than we exported. In  the deficit grew to £billion. But by , once the lower Pound had taken effect, it was £billion. However former Brexit Secretary David Davis was wrong when he pinned hopes this week of a sizeable, long-term export boost on a devaluation of the Pound.Brexit success depends on cutting taxes, trade barriers and regulatory burdens, just as Singapore has done.No matter how positive the economic data, however, there are many Remainers who simply will not accept that the economy is not crashing.They want that to happen because they want to be proved right. It is surprising the relentless tales of doom have not caused a recession by destroying consumers’ confidence.If we had taken notice of what the Eeyores were trying to tell us about economic collapse and stopped spending, recession would have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Evidently, British consumers have the good sense to see the forecasts of doom as the anti-Brexit propaganda that they are.The economy is not roaring ahead, but strip away the gloomy headlines and there is more good news than bad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,.

And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it.

Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

Britain is due to leave the European Union on March . Pro-Remain MPs from across the Commons welcomed the announcement, with Tory former minister Anna Soubry saying there will be nowhere for any MP to hide come the final week of March.   She said: There is now a real danger that this is going to go right down to the wire. The Prime Minister appears intent on holding the long-awaited meaningful vote as late as possible, in the hope of pressuring MPs into backing what they know is a bad deal.And Jeremy Corbyn appears happy to let the clock run down, rather than tabling Labours proposals or backing a Peoples Vote.But come the final week of March there will be nowhere for any MP to hide, which is why this march could be of historic signicance. Parliament will need a way out, and the demand will be loud and clear: put short term party politics aside, put Britains national interest first. Put it to the people.  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable predicted hundreds of thousands of people would take to the streets to demand their voices are heard.The Governments handling of Brexit has become a national humiliation. They, along with the Labour leadership, want to kick the can down the road, but people across the country will not stand idly by whilst they try to duck the biggest political decision in a generation. Crunch time is coming.I know that hundreds of thousands of people from right across the United Kingdom will take to the streets and join us in demanding that their voices are heard - that the only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a Peoples Vote.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford echoed the belief that the Prime Minister will wait until the final week to tell MPs we have to have a bad or blindfold deal or accept no deal. He added: It is a scandal and we will not accept it. Scotland voted to Remain and we will do everything we can to make sure that all the people of the four nations in the UK have the chance to have the final say on Brexit. Ill be in the march, joining together with people from north and south of the border, in an act of national solidarity against this clear and present danger to all our futures.   Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas added: This is High Noon for Brexit. This march is for all those who are concerned about the way politics is descending into chaos, and for those who feel let down by broken Brexit promises. Whether youre worried about the damage caused by this deal or no deal, or you just want clarity and closure about our countrys direction - rather than years more of argument and ision - join us. By working together, we can fix this mess.

Jacob Rees-Mogg’s rebel European Research Group want her to quit as PM after local elections on May . Inthey will vote for her deal in Parliament so she can hit her March  deadline for the UK to leave the EU. A Tory leadership contest would take place over the summer – with the ERG backing their champion, Boris Johnson. The new PM would be crowned at the Tory Party conference in September.  The plotters calculate they can hold Mrs May to ransom because she cares more about getting Brexit on her terms than she does about being PM.An insider said: “The PM believes in getting things done – and there’s nothing bigger than delivering Brexit. “If she can pull that off she’ll have her legacy. And she’ll feel her work is done.” EU negotiators are adamant they will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, which includes the controversial “Irish backstop” to protect the open border. But they have indicated they can give legal assurances, to appease Brexiteers, that the measure will be temporary. As things stand at least  hardcore ERG backbenchers will not back Mrs May’s deal – either with or without changes to the backstop. Butthey think they can get Boris for PM, it is expected they will back down.With the ERG on board, and  Labour rebels who Mrs May is trying to bribe with cash for their constituencies, the PM will have enough votes to get across the line.And she will be home and drythe DUP come back on board.

Theresa May’s party is fast smashing itself beyond repair. The increasingly eccentric behaviour of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Brexiteer rebels means not even a bodycast would keep the Conservatives intact. And Mrs May’s appeal for unity today will fall on deaf ears. If there were a General Election tomorrow, the PM would find herself in the extraordinary position of campaigning against her own party. And Tory MPs would have to speak out against their leader. That is why an election is unlikely. But in the chaos that is Westminster nowadays, it’s not impossible. Which is also why Labour must be prepared for it. And for the few MPs tempted to break away from Jeremy Corbyn to think again. Opinion polls suggest that Labour and the Tories are running neck and neck. For Labour MPs to turn their backs on their party would be to snatch a catastrophic defeat from the jaws of a slender victory.   We understand the frustration of these MPs. The threat of deselection hangs over them. Mr Corbyn has still not got to grips with anti-semitism. They may well feel he should stop sitting on the fence over Brexit, but the fence is not a bad place to be while the Labour leader sees which side of it the Tories come down on. This newspaper has reservations about some of Mr Corbyn’s twists and turns. But we believe a Labour government led by him is still in the best interests of Sunday Mirror readers. It would be a tragedya handful of MPs besotted by Brexit were to jeopardise that. Sunday Mirror readers would never forgive them. A duty to pubs Philip Hammond might argue that the pub trade has never had it so good. The Chancellor froze beer duty for the second year running in his last Budget. And in giving businesses with rateable values below pound, a tax break, he saved the landlord of a typical Sheffield pub more than pound, a year. But pubs are a special case. They are the soul of both urban and rural communities. They may be closing down at a slower rate than they were, but we are still losing  a week and that is unacceptable.   And at p a pint, UK beer duty remains the third highest in Europe. The Campaign for Real Ale says Brexit presents an opportunity to create a level playing field between pubs and supermarkets and off licences. We heartily agree. And so should the Chancellor as he pieces together Britain’s post-Brexit economy. Pubs should enjoy a special status when Mr Hammond works out which sectors get what tax break. Just as they enjoy a special place in the nation’s heart.

The first thing that struck me was how thin our atmosphere is.It’s not the sprawling, beautul blue sky we’re used to, it’s paper-thin. Then the blackness of space, darker than you can ever imagine. There isn’t one astronaut who doesn’t have their nose pressed against the window, awestruck. When I was six, on  May , the US launched the first American astronaut into space. My school had us all watching it on a small black and white TV. That moment changed my le forever – I was determined to one day go into space. Space exploration is one of the most competitive careers ever, and when the application process opens every couple of years, only a handful are selected.    A physics degree is the minimum to get in, so I got a masters and doctorate in engineering, but it still wasn’t enough. I was turned down three times. Only when I got my pilot’s licence, learnt to sky e and got a job at NASA did I finally get through. My fourth attempt, at  years old. I’ll never forget the moment I was told I’d been signed up for my first space mission. I was working in Mission Control, talking to the astronauts up in space, when I got the call – I would be in the next mission going up in two years. I hung up the phone and wanted to scream, but I still had another seven hours of work before I could get in my car and really let go! By the time my first flight came along, I’d been training for four years for one -day mission. NASA prepares us for everything, the idea being to have all the experiences on Earth, so there are no surprises in space. We fly in jet aircraft and special planes capable of creating -second periods of zero-gravity. We train underwater for space walks. We also undergo extensive, continual medical checks.   Everyone on the mission is trained to have a unique skill – I was responsible for the science experiments on board Then two astronauts on every mission are ex-military test pilots, responsible for flying and landing the shuttle.Two people are also intensively trained to be able to do everything, in case someone gets sick. But we all have basic knowledge – let’s just say I could land us home, just not all that well! One thing NASA doesn’t want is anyone getting sick. A week before launch we’re in quarantine. We have to eat carefully prepared food, so we don’t risk poisoning.Every person we come in contact with has had a full check – we can’t risk getting a cold.The space sickness is bad enough, which around a third of astronauts suffer from, puking their guts up from motion sickness. You can imagine what vomit does up there… Not pleasant.  Launch morning on my first mission was the most exciting day of my le. I was lying on my back, strapped in on top of a lumpy parachute, where I lay for three hours before take off.Then I heard the countdown, and three big engines started rumbling up to full power, causing the spacecraft and me to shake.At lt off I felt a push, assomeone had their hand on the small of my back, hoisting me up. I was screaming like I was on a roller-coaster because I knew nobody could hear me, not even the seven other astronauts I was going up with.Of course there was some fear, but it’s % nerves and % exhilaration. Not for my we, though, who told me she hated that launch morning more than anything. It takes eight and a half minutes to get into space,  miles above the Earth. It becomes eerily silent once you make it.Then you unstrap yourself and float out of your seat. We orbit the Earth every half an hour, and see  sunrises and sunsets every day. On my first ever day in space, I looked out of the window and a flash caught my eye. Every second it would go, getting closer and closer.I couldn’t believe on my first day in space I’d made contact with the unknown! But my alien turned out to be a chunk of ice that had come off the shuttle and was flashing every time it hit sunlight.Another amazing sight was a giant ball of light flashing past. A shooting star. Of course I made a wish – to get home safely. My first mission was to further explore the effects of zero gravity on liquids and fire. Liquids form perfectly round balls, and fire also becomes either droplets or big fire balls too.We take plants and small animals up to observe how they grow and behave. Since then we’ve done plenty of other experiments.  We work -hour days with - hours sleep , an hour for lunch and dinner, and a free hour for exercise.We have magnetic chess sets, and we love playing human catch – one of the crew tucks themselves into a ball and we throw him to each other.As for human contact, it’s important to have communication with home. Whenever we passed over America, I always felt a million miles away, like I was detached from my le.I could send and receive one short email from my we each day, and once during a two week mission she was allowed in Mission Control to speak with me on the phone. When the mission was finally over, getting back is the easy bit. You slow down, turn the shuttle around, fire up the engines and start falling so fast that you can see flames as the atmosphere hits around , degrees.We landed smoothly and were welcomed with a huge lunch at NASA – lasagne, salad and cookies – before they flew us home.After I’d hugged my we, the first thing I did was order a pepperoni pizza. The space food is bland – by the end of a mission I couldn’t wait to eat good food. There are many amazing things about being an astronaut, but you have to savour every second of space time – during my  years, I only spent  days in space.One downside of being home is flying on a plane is now extremely slow and boring. I resent how it takes me nine hours to get to England from America – it could be done in  minutes! It also ruins space movies. Gravity drove me crazy. Even in the opening scene I was saying, ‘They’ve got that wrong!’ Now I’m too old for space travel and have retired, but I teach children of the wonders of space every day. When you’ve had an adrenaline rush like space travel, it’s hard to know what’s next. My dream is to receive a call from someone who I’ve inspired to follow in my footsteps.

The couple, who met while working at the same hospital, found the answer to their dream through shared motherhood. Kirsty, , wanted her own biological child, but didn’t want to be pregnant – while Hayley wanted to be pregnant, but didn’t mindthe child wasn’t genetically hers. So they hit on the perfect,unusual, solution. Doctors would take eggs from Kirsty, fertilise them with an anonymous sperm donor – and then Hayley would carry the couple’s baby. Or, as it turned out, BABIES – as the embryo that was put into Hayley’s womb split, creating identical twins.  There would be heartache and anxiety along the way, but when Hayley gave birth to sons Dylan and Stanley  months ago, their family was complete. Hayley, , said: “People are amazed to hear that it was Kirsty’s eggs and that I was the one who carried the boys. It was a perfect solution for us. “She wanted to have children but didn’t want to be pregnant herself and I didn’t mindthe child I carried wasn’t genetically mine. I have trained as a midwe and I’ve always wanted to be pregnant. So that’s how we decided on how we were going to create our family.” The couple, who live in Kent, met five years ago at a local hospital when Hayley was an AE nurse and Kirsty was a paramedic. Hayley added: “We really hitoff when we met, but we didn’t become a couple for six months. “As soon as I met Kirsty, I knew that she was going to be in my le somehow. “We married in September , then started to look at starting our family.”  The couple had fertility treatment at a private clinic in Southampton. Kirsty had to inject herself daily with drugs to stimulate her oies to produce eggs, which were fertilised with donor sperm. One embryo was put back into Hayley’s womb, but two weeks later, the couple found the treatment had failed. Hayley said: “It was devastating when it hadn’t worked the first time. But we were determined to carry on and not give up hope.” They had a second attempt at fertility treatment in February  – and this time it worked. But they were in for a double surprise when they went for her first scan.  Hayley went on: “We were thrilled when we found out we were expecting twins. We couldn’t believe it when the sonographer showed us two little heartbeats pumping away. It was amazing.” But things did not run smoothly. When Hayley was  weeks pregnant, doctors found the babies were suffering from a rare, le-threatening condition called Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome. It affects only identical twins and occurs when abnormal blood flow in the vessels joining the babies means that one gets more nutrients than the other. It can put too much strain on the bigger twin’s heart and it can mean the smaller baby doesn’t get enough nutrients. The condition puts the le of both babies in peril. Hayley said: “We were devastated when we were told that the twins had it. “The following week I started getting very breathless and filling up with fluid, so they knew something had to be done.”   Hayley was referred to King’s College Hospital in London under the care of world-renowned surgeon Professor Kypros Nicolaides. He operated to separate the twins by laser surgery while they were still in Hayley’s womb. “It was frightening to think they were going to be operated on while I was still pregnant,” Hayley said. “But we knew it was their only chance of survival. And even then we didn’t knowthey were going to survive the surgery.” After the operation, there was a risk that she could miscarry the twins. Only a week later she suffered a massive bleed and had to be rushed back into hospital. But the twins were hanging on – and survived. Hayley then suffered bleeding through the rest of her pregnancy until the twins were finally delivered when she was  weeks pregnant. Stanley weighed in at Ib oz and Dylan was Ib oz. Hayley said: “It was such a relief when they were born safely. We had just been to a baby shower and an hour after we got home, I went into labour. We had to go straight into hospital and the boys were delivered. “Stanley was fine when he was born but Dylan was quite poorly and he had to be on oxygen for four months.” Hayley also suffered postnatal depression after the Caesarean birth and found it dficult to bond properly with the twins for the first eight months. She explained: “It was a strain, but it has brought Kirsty and I closer together. I had treatment for it and, after about eight months, I felt I could love the twins. “They are both doing really well now and are really healthy. “Other people are amazed when we tell them how we have done it, that genetically the boys are Kirsty’s, yet I gave birth to them.” Professor Simon Fishel, from Care Fertility, said: “It’s a very special way to start a family.

Instead of celebrating a curvy new butt she had to face more surgery to remove the two-inch sore on her right buttock. The abscess — caused by fat necrosis, where cells in fatty tissue die — was on the brink of turning septic. Now Kianna is warning other women to think carefully before going for the same “flatter tum, bigger bum” procedure.  The beautician said: “I thought I’d done all the research, checked everything out. “The place had five-star reviews. But things can go badly wrong. If I had another pound, I wish I could go back to the way I was.” Single Kianna, of Runcorn, Cheshire, had been wooed by a clinic boasting “fine craftsmanship of Turkish doctors”. She was treated at a private clinic in Istanbul and her pound, — including flights and transfers — looked to be a bargain compared to the pound, she could have paid for the same op in the UK.  The procedure is popular among women wanting to reshape the buttocks by transferring fat from other areas of the body.But Kianna said far from trying to emulate the likes of reality star Kim Kardashian , she was doing it purely because she was uncomfortable with her size  body.She said: “I wanted a flatter tummy and bigger bum. I did all the research online, I could have done it cheaper, but I went for a place that got five-star reviews. “I could have had implants, but I read using your own fat was safer. “I’d read about a poor British girl who died in Turkey last year after shygoing for a bum lt, but I’d done all the research. “I thought I’d done everything right. I saved for three years, I spent that time doing research. I thought I’d got the best.” Kianna booked with MCAN Health, flew out last month and was put up in a five-star hotel in the centre of Istanbul.  She went on: “When we were picked up from the airport there were three guys in the minibus with me. They weren’t English but I think they were over for treatment too. The hotel was lovely. “I had to get up at am the next morning and the driver picked me and another girl up. She was dropped at one place and I was taken to my clinic.” Kianna was booked in at the Osmanoglu Hastanesi centre and expected plush premises to match images online. But she says the reality was very dferent: “It looked a bit old to me, I was expecting a modern, fancy place. “I’d already paid a  euro deposit so I handed over the other , euros. They didn’t give me a receipt.   “The room was pretty basic — bed, cabinet, shower. I felt uncomfortable because no one seemed to speak English. “When the doctor came to meet me he was more interested in my tattoos. They were all speaking to each other in Turkish while drawing on me with the marker pen.” Despite her misgivings, Kianna had the five-hour procedure on January  and said when she woke up she was “in pain everywhere”.She said: “I lay in the bed shaking, my boobs were out and there was no blanket to cover me. I had to use Google translate to ask a nurse ‘please will you get a vest for me’.I’m normally quite easy going, but I felt like I was being shyignored. I was bruised, swollen, on my own, upset and crying, which really isn’t me.” After one night at the clinic, she spent a further two nights at a hotel and then had a check-up with her surgeon. That showed “normal healing” and she flew home. But two weeks later her buttock became lumpy and sore. She was also disappointed by the “flatter shystomach” procedure – saying she has been left with a “square shape” on her tummy. Kianna messaged her MCAN aftercare team and claimed they told her to use Arnica gel — a herbal remedy for relieving pain and inflammation — and to apply a cold compress. But on February  she went to an NHS walk-in centre after the wound got worse.She was sent to Warrington Hospital where she was diagnosed with an infected abscess. Kianna was told she was at risk of le-threatening sepsis had the wound been left much longer.  The next day she had surgery to shyremove the abscess and was in hospital for three nights. She is on antibiotics, needs two weeks rest and fears she may be left scarred. She was full of praise for the NHS staff and added: “The doctors and nurses in Warrington were amazing, they weren’t judgmental in any way. “They didn’t tell me it was all self-inflicted or ask why I went abroad. I thought they would be saying ‘look at that silly cow’, but they were just brilliant.”  Now Kianna is urging others to think carefully before going abroad for cosmetic surgery. She warned: “I’d urge anyone to think carefully about what they’re having done andthey really need it. If I had the money I’d go back to the way I was.” Kianna said she sent pictures of her abscess to MCAN and was told it was due to fat necrosis. MCAN’s website boasts: “A Brazilian butt lt in Istanbul: this is where the West really meets the East! The fine craftsmanship of Turkish medical doctors is famous. You will find Turkish surgeons in JCI-accredited hospitals all over the world. But in Turkey the prices of cosmetic surgery are much lower. That makes often expensive treatments within reach for a much wider population.” MCAN has offered Kianna free corrective surgery – but she has no intention of ing. A spokesman said: “We hope Kianna will get well soon and all we can do is support her as much as we can. “As we stated to Kianna, complications are very rare and shyunfortunately it shyhappened to her. We will communicate with her doctor and support her as much as we can. “If she needs any corrective surgery, this will be free of charge.” But she said: “I wouldn’t go back to the clinic for surgerymy le depended on it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 4 who lost legs","story":"NewsBrave boy, , who lost both legs due to parents abuse to have law named after himIntroduction of Tonys Law follows the harrowing case of Tony Hudgell who was physically abused as a babyShareByJulia Roberts:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe story of Tony Hudgell has inspired a new whichpassed will affect sentencing of child abusers \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old boy who lost his legs after being physically abused by his parents is to get a law named after him.

Single mum Elysia Downings can make up to pound, a year and says the job has made her the happiest she’s ever been.The -year-old, from Buxton in Derbyshire, charges punters pound. a minute to watch her get her kit off and perform ious erotic acts online. She has around  subscribers, with some loyal fans dishing out thousands of pounds to see her private broadcasts from her bedroom. And she admits you’ve “got to have a sense of humour”you want to do it. “You need to let go and not have any worries. It’s all in our heads,” she said.   In just one week, Elysia, who has a six-year-old son, earned pound, in the run-up to Christmas. On average, she aims to make pound a day for two to three hours work – and this is on top of the income she makes from her online lingerie and sex toy shop, Betsy Boudoir. Despite earning around pound, a month - after the camming sites take a percentage - the mum says she does not live a le of luxury and is careful with her money having been in debt before. She shuns designer clothes for high street clobber and is always on the lookout for a bargain and reduced sticker items. “I’m saving as much money as possible,” she said. “Hopefully I am going to retire by the time I’m , which by that time my son will be , so I can enjoy le and not have to worry about work.” She first dipped her toe into the webcam waters last year after seeing an article and signed up to agency, Off the Record Models. Surprisingly some of her clients are usually more interested in talking and want a ‘girlfriend experience’ – not anything sexual. But Elysia will still be wearing stockings and lingerie that are “revealing but leave something to the imagination”. This includes lacy black babydolls or red bodysuits so she can ‘channel her inner Pamela Anderson.’  She said: “At first it took a little while to build up the clients, but I love the freedom it gives me. “It’s just like any business you get out what you put in. “And I really don’t think it’s all to do with attractiveness. It’s just about being a businesswoman – and I’ve had years of practise seducing men.” It takes Elysia around  minutes to get glammed up before getting in front of the camera, but most of this time is spent putting on her wig, which helps her “adopt a persona.” Her oddest request was from a man with a wet and messy fetish, also known as sploshing. He asked her to watch people getting gunged on Noel’s House Party - the s BBC comedy show hosted by Noel Edmonds, which propelled Mr Blobby to fame. She knows of another webcam girl with a client who has a fetish for being eaten – known as vorarephilia – and he pretended to be a Jaffa Cake while she ‘ate him’. Elysia has been single for three years andshe were to get into a new relationship, she admits it would be a tricky situationfaced with an ultimatum to quit her webcam career.  “I thinkI was in love and I had a way of being able to make that amount of money then it would be no issue,” she admitted. Elysia’s family and her son’s father are all aware and supportive of her career choice as they “can see how happy” she is. They were initially concerned about her safety, but she made it clear it was not like escorting and she wouldn’t be meeting men face-to-face. All her son knows is “mummy sells underwear” which he finds funny – but she is not naiumlve to the fact he will one day discover the other side of her career. She said: “I don’t want him to get bullied, but kids will get bullied for anything these days. My mum was a lesbian and I got a lot of stick for that. “The only thing I can do is raise him to not care what people think and it doesn’t matter. There is even more of a stigma about being in this industry as a mother, she added. I feel that women should be allowed to express their sexuality freely regardless of whether or not they are a mother.   “I don’t mind what other people think of me. I don’t need the validation and that’s what I want to teach him.” Elysia considers herself a shrewd businesswoman – although as a young girl she pictured herself one day being a journalist and editingCosmopolitan magazine. Sheleft school with seven A*s in her GCSEs and says her IQ score was in the top five per cent of the country. But after going through a dficult period in her le, Elysia left college and took on ious jobs such as working in shops or as a cleaner. But she knew she wasn’t fulfilling her potential and felt miserable. However, she finally feels like she has hit the jackpot and found a job she loves, which also makes herfeel sexually empowered. “I love doing it, I feel free and liberated - and I do feel powerful,” she said. “It’s been so good for my confidence, especially after having a baby and stretchmarks – I’ve learnt to accept my body. “I know people will judge me regardless, but I am the happiest I’ve ever been.”  Meanwhile, fellow webcam girl Sophia has lted the lid on what it’s like to secretly moonlight as an adult entertainer. As she buttons up her crisp white shirt and slips on a black skirt and heels she looks just like any other office worker.But the -year-old isnt going to be sitting behind a desk all day, instead shes about to perform in front of a webcam as a dominatrix from the comfort of her own bedroom. Punters fork out hundreds of pounds to see Sophia fulfil their fantasies through a computer screen.She can make up to pound a week pocket money to top up her salary working in the hospitality industry. Sophia, from London, wants her real identity to be kept shrouded in secrecy for fear her family may find out. And she is among thousands of women leading a double le as a webcam girl behind closed doors. The flexibility is the best thing about the job, she admitted. And when the money is good, its very good. Sophias go-to role play is to be a sexy secretary who needs to punish her workers. Her clients, who often chose not to show themselves on their own webcam, revel at the thought of being controlled. I get a lot of people who want me to be their boss, Sophia revealed.  I will give them an appraisal, or monthly appraisal, and say their performance is not very good and they are going to have to be punished. I will then go on to say how I am going to spank them. Sophia, who can earn as little as pound a day or as much as pound, gets paid by the minute so she uses a iety of tactics to keep her viewer online for as long as possible. She does not want to ulge the nitty gritty details but added: Its a job and light-hearted fun. Some people can be derogatory but its the nature of the work.” She advertises her service on the CamNClimaxxx website, where women create a profile under dferent categories, including housewives, redheads, college girls and many others too explicit forto publish. Each woman lists what they offer and what they like. The client will then log in to a chat with the girl and the fantasies can begin.  Sophia, who is single and describes herself as a normal size , said: I offer domination and other things such as striptease. But I always stay clothed. You get a lot of fetish requests like people wanting to be dominated or people who want you to be sexy. Its a fantasy. Every request is dferent, and every person has dferent likes. Like Elyshia, Sophia said her weirdest request was from someone who wanted her to be gunged like on a TV quiz show, so she duly obliged by pouring water all over herself. Nobody - not even close friends - know about Sophias career and she is terried by the thought either they or her colleagues could find out. Its the stigma around it, she said. You can do things to disguise yourself like using wigs, but there is always the possibility that someone you know will see you.” Sophia has been doing it now on and off for  years to fit around her day job. However she plans to quit later this year as her hospitality career looks set to take off. I was nervous the first time I did it, she said. Then it becomes normal to you. “I find it fun and it does make me feel confident.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gordon banks gave touching last","story":"NewsGordon Banks gave touching last gt to charity just two weeks before he diedEXCLUSIVE: The Three Lions hero donated a signed photo of his miracle World Cup save from Pele to auction for Alzheimers research despite battling the final stages of cancerShareCommentsBySimon Wright:,  FEB NewsGordon Banks priceless gt to Alzheimers research just weeks before his death has been revealed \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEngland legend Gordon Banks made a touching last gt to help Alzheimer’s research just two weeks before he died. The World Cup winning goalie was battling the final stages of cancer, but still asked close pal Glyne Wetton round to his home to collect a signed photo of his miracle World Cup save from Pele to auction for the charity. “He was always so generous with his autograph, but that was probably the last thing he signed”, said Glyne, . “It was so typical of Gordon that he was thinking about what he could do for others even when he was struggling so much himself. He was the kindest, most humble man I’ve known.” And it was fitting that the ace goalie’s gt was to a charity battling a disease that struck down so many footballers of his generation – feared to be linked to heading the heavy footballs of the era. Gordon also wrote Glyne a poignant letter three weeks before he died on Tuesday, aged , admitting: “I’ve been having a lot of bad days lately.” Then he bravely added: “I know I’ve just got to get on with it and hope I get back to normal.”   He signed off the note by passing on his best wishes to Glyne and his we, saying: “I hope things go well for you both. Take care and look after yourself.” Former PE teacher Glyne yesterday fought back tears as he revealed the letter’s contents – one of many he shycherishes from the star. The pair met in  when Glyne helped Gordon meet his own boyhood football idol, s Wolverhampton Wanderers goalie Bert Williams. “I was hosting a charity dinner at Molyneux Stadium to raise money for the Alzheimer’s Society,” Glyne recalls. “Bert and I had been friends most of our lives and he was one of the guests. Gordon rang me out of the blue askinghe could come too. “He explained he had been a Wolves fan as a boy and that Bert was the reason he became a goalkeeper.”The meeting led to a deep friendship between all three men, until Bert died in January  aged . “I’ll never forget the moment they met,” says Glyne. “It was wonderfully emotional. They embraced and it seemed neither could find the words they wanted to say. “They did talk goalkeeping though – they both had a pop at Joe Hart, then playing for England, saying they thought he was a bit vulnerable at the near post.”   Gordon also revealed his trademark ritual of marking the middle of his goal with his studs and touching both posts before kick-off was copied from Bert. “They grew very close. I would often collect Gordon from his home and drive him to Bert’s where we would spend hours talking football,” added Glyne, of Brewood, Staffs. “It meant Gordon and I became close friends too. He told me all about winning the World Cup and that Pele save in . His stories were amazing, he told them so well, but he was always so modest. No airs and graces, just a wonderful man. “I knew a few days before he died that he was fading. I was so sad when he finally left us. It feels like I’ve not long lost Bert and now I’ve lost Gordon too. “I like to think they’re together again somewhere, talking goalkeeping.” "},{"url":null,"title":"im celebs harry redknapp gives","story":"NewsIm A Celebs Harry Redknapp gives eviction notice to needy tenants for huge property dealEXCLUSIVE:  vulnerable people, who live at the Belgravia hotel in Bournemouth, could be forced on to the streets by May - after the millionaire served them eviction noticesShareCommentsByAlan Selby:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsHarry Redknapp has served an eviction notice to the Belgravia Hotel in Bournemouth in a bid to convert the property into luxury flats \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Millionaire Harry Redknapp has come under fire for leaving  vulnerable bedsit shytenants facing homelessness as his company makes a fortune on a property deal.Their worried landlady called on him to cough up some of his pound, winnings from I’m A Celebrity to save them from a le on the streets. Good Samaritan Wendy Hunt, whorents the property and sub-lets rooms to the destitute at the Belgravia Hotel in Bournemouth, has been served an eviction notice by the former soccer boss. It means she and her tenants must be gone by May  so work can start on converting the building into money-spinning luxury flats.Wendy, , said: “I’ve got  people here. All of them will be homeless . We did try to get Harry to give them something to help them, but that was turned down.“A lot of them are vulnerable. They’ve been here years. I took them without deposits because they were on the streets, so now they won’t have money for a deposit somewhere new. “Can’t he do something with the money he won on I’m a Celebrity  He got a lot for that, on top of the money he’s already got. My poor people have got nothing.”  The revelation comes just weeks after Harry, , was pictured handing the jam roly-poly puddings that he raved about on I’m A Celebrity to rough sleepers. One tenant Joanne White, , said: “We’ve sent Harry letters, and not heard anything back. All we want to know ishe’s actually aware of what this is going to do to us.” Another, Edward Hyde, , added: “We just don’t want to be made shyhomeless. This isn’t a vendetta. It’s not about us against him. He’s got every right to do what he wants to do.” Wendy and husband Gerry have run the Belgravia as homes for vulnerable people with no deposits, references or guarantors since . Their tenants pay just pound a week including bills. Similar accommodation nearby costs more than double – and local homeless services are believed to be full. In , Pierfront Developments – with former West Ham and Spurs manager Redknapp and his we Sandra as directors – bought the property from the owner for pound.million.  The local council turned down plans to demolish the hotel – but it’s set to give the go-ahead on Tuesday to proposals to convert the inside of the building to  flats and build five mews houses on surrounding land. Sub-tenant Edward told us he moved in three and a half years ago after losing his job as a hospital porter. He said he did not qualy for support from Bournemouth Council because he was not a high priority candidate. Wendy and Gerry offered him a room after an outreach worker suggested the Belgravia. He said: “There’s nowhere in this town where you could move in without references, a deposit, and all of that. “You’ve got to be perfect to move in somewhere and be a key holder. You also need shythousands of pounds. “We don’t know how we’re going to raise enough money. We want to know support is going to be there. We want to be resettled. We don’t want to be on the streets.” Trevor Simpson, who moved in after leaving prison, said: “No-one really cares about homeless people. It’s the same across the whole country.  “Wendy will take anyone here. It doesn’t matter who you are, she’ll help youyou help yourself, and give you a roof over your head. “We’ve put objections to the council, but we can’t stop it. All we want is for the council to sit down with Harry, talk things through and let us know where we stand so we can find somewhere to go. “There is nowhere . Even the ASDA car park plays bagpipe music all night to keep people away. Nobody will take anyone without guarantors. Who’s going to guarantee us  “I couldn’t live on the street. It would physically kill me. I know eight people who died last year.” Tenants will be given a month’s notice to leave in writing at the start of April. They can be forgiven for feeling upset by pictures of Harry feeding homeless people at Bournemouth’s Sacred Heart church just a mile and a half away from the Belgravia on December . The star grinned as he said: “It’s all getting eaten.”   Trevor added: “Harry gave out jam roly-poly over Christmas and opened a charity shop the other week. But he’s not come here and spoken to us.” Fellow tenant Joanne said: “I don’t think he’s really taken on board how serious a problem it’s going to be.” Anton Oosthuizen, , who moved in after sleeping rough, said: “We don’t blame him. “We just want some help to find somewhere  to live. We don’t want to stop his venture. We wish him all the best. We’ve sent our letters to him recorded delivery. Why won’t he listen to us ” A design and access statement by a planning consultant hired by Pierfront states the Belgravia “has been converted to provide self-contained bedsit accommodation. The proposals would formalise the existing residential use and ensure a high standard of residential accommodation can be provided.” A letter sent by Pierfront Developments Limited to Wendy and Gerry Hunt in January says: “Please provide confirmation your clients will immediately provide possession on May , .”  Bournemouth Borough Council said: “We would urge all residents who think they are at risk of homelessness to make contact with the council’s Housing Options Team as soon as possible. “Our officers will help them look at rehousing options and make sure they maintain contact with the leaseholder of this property to help enable these timely discussions.” A source told us the application had been delegated to planning officers so, although it has yet to be formally agreed, it was highly unlikely it would be refused. A spokesman for Redknapp’s firm said: “I can confirm Pierfront Developments completed the purchase of the Belgravia Hotel in  with Mr Mrs Hunt being sitting tenants. “Pierfront Developments have a lease in place with Mr and Mrs Hunt, and from Pierfront Developments’ understanding the tenants sub-let the main hotel. “In August  Mr and Mrs Hunt signed a consent order, and notice was served in February to vacate the property by May . All legal proceedings were dealt with by both representatives’ solicitors.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jihadi bride shamima begum who","story":"NewsJihadi bride Shamima Begum who fled UK describes the best part of living under ISISHeavily pregnant Shamima Begum, , wants toto London to raise her third child after the other two died while she was in SyriaShareByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsShamima, originally of Bethnal Green, east London, could face a y court battle to keep her baby \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email One of three teenage girls who fled to Syria to become a Jihadi bride has revealed the best part of living under ISIS .Shamima Begum, who is heavily pregnant, wants toto the UK to raise her third child with the other two reportedly dying in infancy.

The teenager has revealed that it was her husband Yago Riedijk who was the best thing about living under ISIS. The marriage was arranged by ISIS after she arrived but the teenager says she fell in love with Dutchman Riedijk.Speaking to The Times she said: He treated me really well. I cant deny that.  I would never have found someone like him back in the UK. Riedijk, , travelled to Syria in  from Arnhem in the Netherlands. He is being held in a camp separate to his we.

Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls, along with Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, from Bethnal Green Academy who left the UK in February .

She was delighted to find out she was pregnant with her first child in January . But after falling unwell and heavily bleeding at just  weeks, Destiny was rushed into surgery for a C-section in in a bid to save her daughter - however, once surgery was over, she was told that her childs heart had stopped beating. The procedure, alongside suffering a ruptured placenta, caused the delivery driver, from Massachusetts, US, to lose over four pints of blood and left her on deaths door for the following six weeks.   However now, Destiny and her husband Christopher, , are filled with joy now they are -weeks pregnant, and are optimistic about the future. Destiny said: When we first tried to get pregnant, we had two miscarriages, but we really wanted a child so continued to try. When we were pregnant with Kaia, everything was looking great and there were no indications that anything was going to go wrong. But then when I reached  weeks, I was really sick so went to the hospital and later on that day I started bleeding so the doctors rushed me to surgery. They gave me a c-section in hope that they would be able to save my babys le, but after the surgery was done they told me her heart had stopped beating. When I had the surgery I lost a lost of blood that it almost killed me - so I was fighting for my le for six weeks while they tried to restore what fluids I had lost.   Dealing with something so physically painful, as well as emotionally, made it the hardest thing I had ever done. But now we have found out we are pregnant again and, although it comes with a lot of fear, we are delighted to hopefully have a healthy baby. Despite Destiny and Christophers excitement at becoming parents again, they are still holding their excitement in until they have confirmation their baby is healthy. Destiny said: For over a year after we lost Kaia I wasnt ready to try again, but we got pregnant right away after deciding we were ready. Were both really excited, but also holding a lot back until we know that shes healthy.   Due to our last pregnancy, I am now being monitored really closely to make sure everything goes well - higher levels of ultrasounds, and being seen at hospital more often. I think until the baby is in my arms and alive, its something that Ill be battling with for the rest of my pregnancy. Destiny is sharing her story to open peoples eyes to why abortion can help people - and even save lives - in light of new abortion laws coming into play in New York, US, which allows women to have abortions after  weeksnecessary to preserve the mothers health orthe fetus isnt viable. She said: If people find out that their children may not make it, or that they are going to have a condition which may cause them to be stillborn, I believe a woman should be entitled to having an abortion.  It is someones own choice, and at the end of the day it could save someone s le and stop them from having to go through something that could kill them. A woman should be able to make her own choiceshe finds out her baby is going to die anyway. The doctors have already recommended to me thatour baby has the same condition as Kaia that we terminate the pregnancy, and I think thats a choice I should be entitled to.

It also states there is a risk of overlooking the neighbouring garden. The playhouse, which has been built on the roof of the garage on Berry Hill Grove, can be accessed via a ladder which leans against the building. The council was made aware of it at the beginning of January.   It was also made aware of another unauthorised construction - a wooden post and corrugated plastic structure at the front of the house. The two constructions were discussed at a council meeting on February . In its report to the committee, the council said: The childrens playhouse, positioned on top of the garage, detracts from the overall quality and character of the area. There is a risk of overlooking the neighbouring garden from the top of the garage to the detriment of neighbouring amenities and it is visually intrusive on the street scene. The structure at the front of the property was described as having hanging lights and plant pots, with a table and chairs underneath.   The report found the structure - which has also been ordered to be removed - was visually unattractive and of poor architectural design. The family have been notied of the council decision. A council spokesman said earlier:“The planning committee at Gedling Borough Council approved enforcement action against an unauthorised construction of a playhouse built on the roof of a garage and wooden structure on the front elevation at a property on Berry Hill Grove, Gedling.

Born into a lovely middle-class family, Yago Riedijk grew up in an affluent suburb in the eastern Netherlands with his parents and sister. Neighbours have told how the polite little boy would play football in the street in Arnhem, where his dad worked as a railway engineer. But now aged , Riedijk is a convicted terrorist who police believe was a member of a cell plotting an atrocity in Europe, The Times reports. A convert to Islam, he is said to have travelled to Syria in October . He married Begum, then , just  days after she fled to the war-torn country from Bethnal Green, east London, to join the caliphate in .   The pair have since had two children together, who both died as infants. Today, Begum, now , is heavily pregnant with her third child - and desperately wants toto the UK to raise the youngster. She has insisted she is not that stupid -year-old girl that left the UK. She has also said she still loves Riedijk very much, telling The Times he treated her really well and was the best thing about le under ISIS. Riedijk, who is among a group of Arnhem men under investigation by Dutch police, fled from the village of Baghuz with Begum around a fortnight ago. He is reported to have since surrendered to fighters allied to the Syrian Democratic Forces, while his we is at a refugee camp in northern Syria.   Begum now fears she may not see her husband again.  My husband was afraid thatwe ever did go back to our own country, theyd never let us see each other again, she said.

Since being in Syria, he has allegedly bragged about marrying a -year-old British girl and has taken pictures with a fake rle, the Daily Mail reports. Police believe he was part of a cell from Arnhem planning to use guns and grenades to carry out a terror attack on a funfair in Europe.   A neighbour of his familys Netherlands home told the paper: It is a shock, I did not know their son went to Syria. They are a nice family, lovely people. Their daughter is a beauty and studied science at university. The neighbour recalled how Riedijk used to play in the street, adding that his hometown is not where you would expect to find jihadis. It is reported that Riedijk - who was put on a Dutch government terrorist watch list three years ago - became radicalised watching videos of Syria. His current whereabouts are unknown During her wide-ranging interview with The Times, Begum said she does not want her child removed by social servicesshe s to Britain.   It has been claimed she could face legal proceedings by Tower Hamlets to remove the child form her care. The local borough is said to have intervened in similar cases involving former Islamists. Speaking to reporter Anthony Lloyd, the teenager also conceded that herto her country of birth could prove to be highly controversial. “I knew that coming back to the UK wouldn’t be a quiet thing, she said.

Finance experts expect a flood of claims after pensions campaigner and independent MP Frank Field revealed the fightback against dodgy advisers can be made by relatives who suspect pension mis-sales.

But experts believe the figure will be even higher this year. Sarah Stokes of Pension Claim Consulting says she has seen a huge spike in compensation cases for pension holders who have died. She said: “More and more people want to claim after a relative or friend has died, usually the deceased had no clue they had been given bad advice. “But when their finances are examined after they’ve passed, it becomes clear they’d been guided into unsuitable pension investments. “Our caseload for such claims is  times what it was a year ago because people are starting to cotton onto the regulations, which have not been very well publicised.   “When you think that over  million people have a personal pension, it stands to reason that claims will continue to rise.” Windfalls often total pound, and can rise to pound,the financial ombudsman upholds a claim.

Nickell, from Lincoln, admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and was yesterday sentenced to four months in prison at Hull Crown Court.

A court was told how Nickell and Mann, who travelled to the city to see a concert, had been drinking and laughed in the aftermath of the assault.   One of the defendants was heard shouting during the incident: You dirty, scumbag, trampy b*******. The attack led to one of the homeless men, Steven Cadman suffering a minor injury to his knee. Passing sentence, Judge Mark Bury described the attack as repugnant. Speaking after the hearing, Hull Central Neighbourhoods Inspector Julian Hart said this afternoon: We do not put up with this type of antisocial and violent behaviour in Hull.   My officers work tirelessly in all our communities all across the city to tackle such issues. This was a reckless and thoughtless act that took place after the pair had been drinking which could have resulted in much more serious injuries.

And all their hard work has paid off, as they have managed to produce a giant cabbage which is now the same size as a person. The semi-retired couple have been growing vegetables for years but said this is the biggest theyve ever had. Rosemary, , said: Its unbelievable how big it had gotten. I didnt realise just the size of it until we picked it. We had a few cabbages that we had started growing altogether, but the others did not do as well as this one. So, we decided to just let it keep going.   It could have kept growing I think, but we decided we should finally pick it because the insects were starting to get into it. It would have been too dficult to get them out, and we would have ruined it. So it was just time. I had no idea it was that big. My first reaction was to get a photo, because no one would have believed how huge it was. I also use a complete organic fertiliser, which I think really helps.   The couple, who live in Tasmania in Australia, explained they managed to keep out hungry wallabies and possums with a wire fortress fence and had to place the cabbage under a net to stop insects such as slugs and butterflies from getting into it. Rosemary and Sean began growing the cabbage in April last year and finally decided to pick it last month - but admitted they did not realise how large it truly was until it was harvested. And since then, the proud couple have managed to get an incredible three weeks worth of meals out of the cabbage - with both them and their guests enjoying a delicious stream of salads, coleslaw, and German rotkohl.   Rosemary said: Cabbages have always grown well in Tasmania, and this is a testament to that. I think it also has something to do with the weather and the soil fertility. We had a wet spring, good rainfall and hot weather this summer. The cabbage has fed us all really well for the last three weeks, and it still tastes fresh.   We grow as many vegetables as we can for our guests here. We cook dinner most evenings, so we like having lots of fresh produce. Everyone has loved eating the cabbage, and weve tried to be as creative as we can. Thankfully we love cabbage, so its certainly been a real treat.

The entire crew of the SS Ourang Medan and its captain were found strewn around the ship with expressions of convulsive horror but no obvious injuries that could have killed them.Before investigations could determine what happened, a fire broke out and the vessel sunk without trace, reports the Sun.A secret CIA memo detailed the eerie frenzied SOS call from on board. All officers, including captain dead, lying in chartroom and on bridge... probably whole crew dead, the call said.   Written by C.H Marck Jr, assistant to the Director of the CIA Allen Dulles, in , to an unknown recipient, the memo continues: There followed a series of indecipherable dots and dashes and then came quite clearly: I die. The document reveals that the agency believed the doomed boat could hold the key to a series of other disappearances in one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes.It was penned years after the dutch vessel is said to have sent a distress call in  while sailing the Strait of Malacca - where Malaysia Airlines flight MH vanished in .The distressing Morse code SOS call, made by a signaller on board SS Ourang Medan, was heard by the crew of nearby ship the Silver Star. Rescue ships rushed to find the stricken vessel, finding her just  miles from the position given. But investigators found an eerie sight when they boarded, the memo continues.  There wasnt a living creature on the ship, it said. The captain lay dead on the bridge. The bodies of the other officers sprawled in the wheelhouse, chartroom and wardroom. The faithful sparks was slumped in a chair in the radio shack, his hand still on the sending key. The bodies of the crew lay everywhere, in the rooms, in the passageways, on the decks. And on all the dead faces was a look of convulsive horror. Referencing a report by Merchant Marine Council, C.H Marck Jr added that their frozen faces were upturned to the sun with mouths open and staring eyes. The ships dog, a small terrier, was also dead with its teeth bared in anger or agony.   The boarding parties decided to tow the vessel to port to continue investigations, but, according to the memo, at that very moment smoke and flames belched forth from the hold. They abandoned the ship and there was an explosion, before it sunk without trace with all the dead crew, never to be seen again. Strangely, the coast guard didnt report it until  - six years after it sank. Some questionit ever existed, with no mention in the Lloyds List of shipping and no record of the Silver Star attempting a rescue. Conspiracy theorists questionseveral countries worked together to cover the mysterious incident up, while others believe a noxious gas bubbled from the seabed.

As Mexican cocaine king Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman begins a le sentence, America’s Drugs Enforcement Administration must now hunt down an even more fearsome quarry. A cunning billionaire former avocado grower and cock-fighting enthusiast — who was once a COP. Nemesio Oseguera-Cervantes — aka El Mencho — is so fearless he even kidnapped the millionaire playboy sons of his now caged arch-rival. After setting up his own New Generation cartel in Jalisco state ten years ago, he made his mark in the bloodcurdling Narcos world by dumping  bound and tortured bodies in the streets of Mexican port Veracruz at rush hour.   Two years later, Mencho’s men raped, killed and set fire to a ten-year-old girl they mistakenly believed to be the daughter of one of their rivals. In , his assassins executed a man and his young son by detonating sticks of dynamite duct-taped to their bodies. Chapo’s partner Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada holds the title of the planet’s biggest drug dealer.But it is little wonder that Oseguera-Cervantes, , is the DEA’s most wanted, with a million bounty on his head.  His crystal meth, cocaine and heroin consignments not only flood the States, but they also hit the streets HERE and in Europe, Australasia, Africa and Asia too. “He’s public enemy number one,” said Paul Craine, who was head of the federal DEA in Mexico during the  arrest of Chapo. “And he’s got an army of thousands of bad guys.”   Chapo, , ran the feared Sinaloa state cartel and was immortalised in the Netflix series Narcos: Mexico. He was caught in  and finally sentenced last week. After his arrest, rival drug dealers shyfought a vicious battle with each other to fill the power vacuum. Chapo’s sons Ivan, , and Guzman,  — kidnapped at a restaurant by Mencho’s men in  and freed after Chapo coughed up an estimated million — were muscled out of the way for partner Mayo to take charge. But as a reclusive diabetic close to , his hold on the cartel is slipping. And while he is seen as a survivor of the old school drug runners who abide by mafia-like codes, former policeman Mencho is the image of the new Mexican cartel don.   His cartel embraces social media as a way to announce their presence – carrying out narco-terrorist attacks, beheadings and the dismembering of bodies, for the world to see. All the time Mencho stays in the shadows. He doesn’t make the kind of public challenges to shyauthority that have led to the downfall of other narcos including Colombia’s Pablo Escobar over the years. And he never, ever touches a phone. His foot soldiers keep order with assault rles and wear a unorm of black balaclavas and T-shirts shyemblazoned with the cartel logo. “He runs his cartel like a paramilitary,” says narcos expert Daniel Solis. “Its arsenal, and its organisation put the regular army to shame. “With the insight he gained while in the police, Mencho knows the power of a well-structured force. He has publicly stated he will die shyfighting rather than be taken alive. He expects the same of all his men.”  Mencho rose to infamy from humble beginnings. He dropped out of school at the age of ten to work on his family’s small avocado farm. Four years later he got a job guarding a weed crop before shysneaking into Calornia and setting up as a small-time dealer. He and his cousin were caught shytrafficking and he was deported in the early s. But on histo Mexico, he shymanaged to hide his criminal past and landed a job with the Jalisco state police. He left for the Millennium Cartel, an old ally of Chapo’s mob, then set up his own firm a decade ago which swtly became known for its horrying mass murders. “Its method of shykilling is more akin to ISIS than the shycartels,” adds Solis. “Never shybefore has how they kill, in the numbers that they kill, been seen in Mexico.” When Mencho is cornered he shydisplays his most barbaric streak.   On May , , the Mexican army planned to strike back at him with Operation Jalisco. In a pre-dawn raid, elite paratroopers and federal shypolice flown in by two military helicopters descended on a ranch where they believed Mencho was hiding. But the cartel was waiting in armoured trucks. One of the helicopters was hit, sending it crashing down in flames. Eight soldiers and a police officer were killed. Hours later, Mencho ordered his men to set fire to dozens of hijacked cars, buses, trucks, petrol stations and banks — gridlocking traffic and bringing Jalisco to its knees. The Mexican government was forced to send in , troops to secure the state. Now, in the wake of Chapo’s jailing, the DEA and Mexican authorities are strengthening their bid to bring Mencho down. If he were shycaptured tomorrow, US authorities would be expected to request his extradition, as they did with Chapo. But one DEA source doubts it will get that far. “Mencho’s such a killer, I’d be surprisedhe was captured alive,” he said.

Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gomis set to take over as dundee united target hat trick of wins down at queen of the south","story":"Veteran Morgaro Gomis is set to take over in midfield when Dundee United try to make it three wins on the bounce as they head for Queen of the South today.The -year-old is expected to replace Calum Butcher, who will serve the first game of a two-match ban after his red card in the Scottish Cup win at St Mirren last weekend.His second game on the sidelines will be the cup quarter-final against Ross County or Inverness Caley Thistle which has been confirmed for Sunday, March  at pm.The game is also being televised live on BBC Scotland.As well as continuing their recent winning run, the Tangerines will be looking for their third success of the campaign over Queens.To do that, though, manager Robbie Neilson is well aware they will have to keep in-form home striker Stephen Dobbie quiet.His spectacular strike in the cup at Aberdeen on Sunday was the -year-old’s th goal in just  appearances this term.“He has been on fire lately and someone we will have to get to grips with,” said Robbie.“He has a lot of quality, he knows how to score goals.“He’s just a very good player and I think he has the freedom of Dumfries these days. He’s a god down there.”United have their own in-form attacker in the shape of Pavol Safranko.The Slovakian, who’s on loan from Aalborg, has hit the net three times in his last four games.That’s taken his tally so far to  goals and he’s scored on the two previous occasions he’s faced the Doonhamers.“We been playing well and we’re looking for that to continue,” added Robbie."},{"url":null,"title":"legend maurice malpas reckons january business could help dundee united reach premiership","story":"With a total of  appearances for Dundee United, there’s not many better qualied to speak on the state of things at Tannadice than Maurice Malpas.And the club legend reckons their January business has given them “a chance” of promotion back to the Premiership –they can keep displays up for more than  minutes.He said: “The last couple of games they’ve been good in the first half but ran out of steam in the second. If they can get the players bang at it for more of the game I think you have to say they have a chance.“There is a bigger iety of player to choose from now and they have some players who are willing to put a boot in, which you need when games aren’t going your way.“They have a chance of getting up but they can’t drop many points.”As for his own situation, Malpas is quite content looking on from the stands after being assistant to Richie Foran at Inverness last season.Malpas added: “These days I watch United on a Saturday and do a bit of babysitting.“I’ve no desperation to get back in. If something came along I’d consider it but when you’ve been in the game as long as I have you can’t see the wood for the trees. Once you’re out you see the things that really matter in le and I’m quite happy.“I do a bit of coaching over in America a few times a year which gives me my wee fix but I’m quite happy where I am.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6694df0b4f51.77481809.jpg ","title":"livingston may be off form but dundee boss jim mcintyre expects a tough test today","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is taking nothing for granted when his improving team face off-form Livingston at the Tony Macaroni Arena today.The Dark Blues head over the Forth on the back of displays against Hamilton and Kilmarnock that, but for injury time mishaps, would have earned six points instead of two.An injury-time equaliser cost victory at Accies while the chance to take maximum points against Killie last week slipped away when Kenny Miller’s penalty was saved in the fth minute of time added on.Now it’s on to Livi, who’ve not won since before the winter break but Jim believes Gary Holt’s team remain formidable opponents.“It’s natural that at some stage of a season you will have a dip and they’ve still had a brilliant season. They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available. Midfielder Ethan Robson is expected to recover in time from the groin injury that forced him to miss that game."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6693c1dcc3e1.49955226.jpg ","title":"party goers turning dundee street into bottle graveyard","story":"Locals fear streets around one of Dundee’s busiest nightle spots are turning into a “bottle graveyard”.Areas around South Ward Road have been left in a mess in recent months, with revellers knocking back booze on the streets and using electrical boxes as tables before moving on to city nightspots.Pictures taken earlier this week show beer cans and bottles of spirits dumped opposite the petrol station.One local said the area was particularly bad yesterday morning after party-goers had been out on the town.He said: “I came down Thursday morning just before am.“I was greeted with sick, urine, bottles of spirits and empty cans of beer.“It always seems to be worse on a Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening.“It’s a bottle graveyard on the way into work.“I would assume most of the revellers are partaking in student nights out and are trying to save themselves a few quid.“I feel sorry for the street sweepers who need to clean these areas up because it’s a total disgrace.“This isn’t a one-off either as it’s happening every week.“I came down today and it was totally clear, which leads me to believe it’s a problem related to Wednesday nights.”Despite the worries of residents, owners of nightclubs in the area have denied any knowledge of their customers drinking in the streets before entering their premises.The owner of Carbon and Kush nightclub on South Ward Road, Tahir Ramzan, said he was unaware of issues of alcohol being consumed on the surrounding streets.He said: “This is the first I’ve heard about this.“Anything that happens en route to the club is outwith our control.“The problem isn’t directly outside the clubs and might be impacting more on the petrol garage.“We certainly don’t have issues with our customers who come in during the week.

Up front McLean was dragging the Shettleston defence around with some great running and the ing Cameron almost sneaked through on goal.There were to be no more goals but Star confidently saw the game out for a terric win against an excellent Shettleston team.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"hscp welcomes community commitment ahead of crunch meeting","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire health board 22m debt","story":"NewsAyrshire health board £m debt fearNHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB NewsBoard Chair Martin Cheyne \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire’s health board is on the verge of racking up a poundmillion debt this year. NHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring. Now the Scottish Government are poised to step in and wipe out poundm of the debt mountain. A report presented at a board meeting this week said the “Scottish Government are currently planning on poundmillion of brokerage”. The board had already overspent by pound.m up to the end of December. The debt could soar to pound.m by the end of March. Health bosses are under pressure to reduce that figure before the end of this financial year. Board chair Martin Cheyne said: “It is right to see that we as an organisation are keen to get below the pound.million and we are working as hard as we can towards that.” North Ayshire Council leader Joe Cullinane, who attended the meeting, said: “How many cuts are the health board looking at making during  to   “NHS Ayrshire  Arran have severerly overspent and been underfunded.   “They have received loans from the Scottish Government. “But the headline budget won’t be enough to meet the demands of the health board and the citizens across Ayrshire.” Director of Finance Derek Lindsay told the board it “has managed to reduce spend in agency nursing”. Nursing agency spend has been pared down to poundm for the current financial year. The report said: “ Whilst it may not be possible to completely eradicate the use of agency nurses, a further poundm reduction is on target to be achieved in  .” There has been a dramatic reduction over the last three years with costs paid on external nursing staff droppng by half. The figure dipped from pound.m in   to pound.m in  . The risk for “financial performance” overall has been branded as “high” in the report. Initially, the board predicted its shortfall would be poundm this year. It is now working on a three-year budget plan.

Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters.

John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.

Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-to-build-houses-near-to-prestonpans-railway-station","story":"LAR Housing Trust is aiming to create the new properties, which could be in place by spring next year, in a similar style to their recently-completed development in nearby Cockenzie.The development, which is being considered by East Lothian Council, would be created on the site of the former Lothian Coated Fabrics building and next to the eastbound  at the neighbouring railway station.LAR Housing Trust, which is an affordable housing provider, plans to create affordable housing on the site, which it will operate as  per cent affordable mid-market rent.Plans with the local authorityrsquos planning department note that the scheme would be ldquosimilar to the  flats at the Boatyard, Cockenzie Harbour.Dunfermline-based LAR Housing Trust said that the existing development had ldquoproven to be successful and well received by East Lothian Council, the local community and new residents.The design and access statement, which makes up part of the new planning application for the Prestonpans proposal, reads: ldquoThe Cockenzie Harbour site required high-quality design with traditional features and local character, linking into the surrounding area and conservation area.ldquoThese details fit equally well at this site in Prestonpans, bringing character in keeping with the traditional features of the railway station and adjacent housing.Nineteen of the flats, which would be based on the eastern side of the site, would have two bedrooms, with the remaining three as single-bedroom properties.Each of the four houses, which would be on the western side of the site, would have three bedrooms.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was aware of the proposals, which had yet to be discussed by the group.He said some concerns had already been raised regarding the size of the plot and the number of properties being proposed.However, he stressed that there was ldquoa crying need for affordable and social housing in the area, with the community council to discuss the proposals at a future meeting.Buildings on the site were demolished in , with the northern section transformed into a Co-op Foodstore and other units, including Links Veterinary Group."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-swimming-pool-shut-all-evening-after-faecal-incident","story":"A spokeswoman for enjoyleisure, which manages the facility, said: \"Regrettably we had to close the pool at Musselburgh Sports Centre on Monday at short notice around .pm.\"This was following a faecal accident.\"In line with our protocols and health and safety requirements, the pool was closed in order to complete a full treatment cycle.\"We fully appreciate the frustration and disappointment this closure caused however we also know that patrons will understand and accept this approach is necessary in such circumstances.\"The spokeswoman said that the pool reopened at am today .A post from Musselburgh Amateur Swimming Club on Twitter said: \"Session cancelled ndash tonights session is unfortunately not running today due to an issue at the pool.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

states that permission has been given for two years, although this could be extended.The historic auction mart was traditionally a bustling agricultural centre for East Linton.However, in recent years

The urge is to pass by, not to linger. It seems utterly counterintuitive that there would be anything yoursquod want here, but searching out Mono ndash the street numbers are confusing ndashwe find the restaurant perched above the Cowgate at a little gap in the buildings Irsquove never noticed before because Irsquove been hurrying past, head down.And my, what a transition! While the world outside is enervating, scruffy, Mono is serene and airy. Its aesthetic is naturalistic, almost Japanese: walls in pumice stone and mercury slate, chairs in sleekly bent wood and soft leather. Our shoulders descend, we breathe slower and deeper.Irsquom poised for pretension. The website talks of its ldquoresearch lab directed by a Michelin star-experienced Polish chef alongside an Italian ldquofoodie. It promises ldquoa multi-sensory experience visual, textual, sound, and all kinds of stimuli , as well as, more encouraging to me, ldquofresh cuisine that follows the roots of culinary principles in Italy: excellent quality ingredients, honest cooking and the belief that food is culture. The menu itself is a tranquil oasis: four each starters and main courses, three desserts.Our meal kicks off with a micro-course of lush, mouth-coating pumpkin soup topped with thick Gorgonzola foam its saltiness balances the sweetness of the gourd. Then therersquos Monorsquos own sour-tanged semolina bread, its handmade rough, salty grissini, and saucers of extra virgin olive oil that comes from Sicily, from one of the chefrsquos relatives who keeps a few trees. Olive oil fraud in Italy is re Irsquove heard this story before, but this oil is so sensational- fabulously fresh, with a minty, eucalyptus background, I can believe in this pedigree.Katy Rodgers crowdie arrives encased in three buckwheat pasta agnolotti parcels, washed up on a creamy chive foam, dissolving leeks, and delicate Shimeji mushrooms, while floppy, golden crusted gnocchi come sauced with a venison ragout that surprisingly has a mild curry edge, the intensity of the game leavened by slightly pickled pear and pear gel. Mackerel in ldquosaorsquor- pickled in the Venetian style- is a triumph of evolved food culture: firm fish, collapsing onions, plumped golden raisins, and pine nuts, served with ldquotextures of caullower: a dreamy pureacutee nutty-tasting slivers of the raw vegetable minuscule deep-fried florets.Fregola, those erratically sized, round pasta balls from Sardinia- whorsquod have thought they could be spellbinding when coated in an ooze of parsnip pureacutee, topped with diced parsnip and parsnip crisps  A parsimonious sprinkle of crumbled honeycomb and some hidden vibrant orange presence make it even more delectable and out of the ordinary. We groan with delight as we dip our forks into an impeccable aged Parmesan risotto. Its powerful cheese foam and soft egg yolk add dferent weights of unctuousness over and above the firm rice below and set up the most pleasing contrast in the form of pancetta thatrsquos been grilled until its as thin as a crisp. Loin of lamb- faultlessly pink, swooningly tender, napped with a sesame dukkah, arrives with radicchio, fennel, and grapefruit salad, and green potato mash encased in a taut jacket of pastry that might or might not owe its interesting texture to polenta.Mono would do well either to hire a dedicated pastry chef or simply its toothsome dishes. Savoury and sweet skills do not always combine in the same chef. Although there are nice elements in them, notably a blissful buttermilk ice cream, these puddings would only benefit from less embellishment. An arrogant Amaretto, marzipan-like bitter almond presence finally blights an over-complex caramelised pineapple dish. Salty miso caramel is another rogue ldquotry-hard element in an otherwise fairly classic chocolate assembly.Italian wine fans will be dazzled by Monorsquos list from leading producers it champions artisanal, organic, biodynamic, sustainable and natural producers, and lesser-known grape ieties.

But consent is something that has more weight, more value, more meaning.\"To consent to something demonstrates an understanding, that its something youre thought about. To me, the two are not interchangeable.\"Britton said that existing case law also highlights that the next of kin have a human right to be consulted under an opt-out system, pointing to the case of a bereaved we from Latvia who took her case to the European Court of Human Rightsafter medics failed to get her permission to remove tissue from her husband after he had died in a car crash in .Dzintra Elberte only discovered that tissue had been taken from her husbands legs before his funeral when Latvian police launched a criminal inquiry two years later into the illegal removal of organs and tissue between  and .It turned out that forensic experts had removed and dispatched some of his body tissue to a pharmaceutical company in Germany to be modied into bio implants.The prosecution was eventually dropped in  when Latvian judges ruled that while the countrys presumed consent system gave next of kin a right to object, the law \"did not impose such an obligation\". However, Mrs Elberte subsequently took her case to the ECHR where she was awarded euro,damages after judges ruled unanimously that her human rights had been violated.They also criticised \"inadequate legal safeguards\", which meant that while a deceaseds next of kin were allowed to object to organ donation the law \"did not clearly define the corresponding obligation of experts to obtain consent\".\"There is this aspect of a human right to be consulted,\" said Britton. \"But the opt-out legislation thats been passed in Wales and proposed for Scotland hasnt really gone down the path of defining that. Now perhaps they feel that because that dialogue and that communication is going happen at the time with the families, but the reality is that very often time is of the essence.\"The law would look at a reasonable attempt - whatever that means in law - to get in touch with whoever is available.\"The vexed question of whether opt-out will actually increase the number of organs becoming available for transplant is something we \"cannot answer\", said Britton. Partly it is because very few people - around one per cent - die in circumstances, such as road accidents, where organs would be viable.In Wales, where an opt-out system came into effect in , there was little change in the number of organ donors: figures show there were  deceased donors in the  months before the law changed, and  in  months after.Britton stressed that a change of legislation alone on its own will not be enough - something she acknowledges that MSPs have taken on board.In Spain, where opt-out was introduced in , there was little discernible effect until a decade later when funds were poured into training more doctors and nurses for intensive care. The whole ethos of the country is also geared to organ donation as a norm, said Britton. But, she stressed, this is something that Scotland - with its comparatively high donor registration rates at present - is well-placed to mirror in future.She said: \"Scotland sadly doesnt have the luxury of the number of intensive care units that Spain has. The other dference is that where we talk about opt-in, opt-out and presumed consent, Spain doesnt tend to emphasise so much on the opt-out element.\"They emphasise much more that there is a general cultural understanding that everybody opts in, but they still have discussion with the family as well.\"Scotland actually has a very good record in terms of the size of the country and population we have. There is good uptake of people currently opting in.\"So evenit doesnt make a dference in the short term, looking at the experience of other jurisdictions in the longer term, it does.\""},{"url":null,"title":"what-flybmi-are-telling-customers-to-do-if-they-have-a-booking","story":"ALL FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT BOTH FROM AND TO THE UK AND WITHIN EUROPE.All Customers due to travel with the Company will need to rebook flights with an alternative airline.Please DO NOT TRAVEL TO THE AIRPORT unless you have arranged an alternative flight with an alternative airline.The Company is unable to arrange or reschedule any flights for you.If Customers have booked through a code share partner of the Companyor a booking agent you should contact them directly.CUSTOMER ACTIONSThe following actions may be available to Customers in respect of any claim they may have relating to any booked flight that has not flown:Credit Cards - Customers who have paid a deposit or paid for flights by credit or debit card and the flights have been cancelled may be able to claim a refund from their card issuer.

The Scottish Tories make valid points about the Governmentrsquos record on transparency, but their arguments is weakened by the fact they voted against the Freedom of Information Scotland Act in .ldquoIn our view, open government need not necessarily mean a bureaucratic system that will cost the taxpayer pound. million a year, declared the then Tory MSP Lord James Douglas-Hamilton. Such opposition has not aged well.In coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Labour introduced the FOISA, but Ministers quickly became exasperated. One dismissed the legislation to me as the ldquonosey bastards charter. I am also old enough to remember Labourrsquos Margaret Curran, at that point the Parliament Minister, toying with a new charging regime in order to deter journalists and lawyers.However, the SNP Government has proven to be an Olympian of anti-FOI activity. And Alex Salmond, as First Minister, was the Steve Redgrave of secrecy.After he became FM, the Scottish Government contended that FOI provided a right to information, not documents. Applicants could not simply ask for emails, reports or minutes, but they would have to say precisely what they wanted in these documents. It was an impossible ask that thrust a stake through the heart of the legislation.In , Ministers told the Scottish Information Commissioner - who adjudicates on disputes - that  of  appeals to the SIC were invalid on the grounds that ldquodocuments were being sought. Some of the cases included requests for correspondence between Salmond and SNP donor Brian Souter, as well as between him and tycoon Sir Angus Grossart, and pop star Sandi Thom.Pushing ahead with this cynical approach, which followed a Court of Session ruling, would have destroyed FOI and Salmond eventually relented.His Government also tried to undermine the authority of the Commissioner. During an appeal process, the SIC can have full access to the information in a dispute, but Salmondrsquos administration queried this power in court. Again, he backed down after a backlash.The Sturgeon Governmentrsquos hostility to FOI is less overt, but no less insidious.

But, yet again, itrsquos all about independence for the SNP even at this critical stage.Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to secure changes to the draft withdrawal Brexit that MPs rejected last month, butshe fails MPs will be allowed to put forward alternatives.One proposal by Kyle and Wilson is for Parliament to back Mayrsquos deal, conditional on there being a ldquoconfirmatory vote, which would give the public a choice between Mayrsquos plan and remaining in the EU.Unlike the first referendum, which was advisory, the result of a confirmatory vote would be binding and automatically go into statute.The SNP supports another EU referendum, but it is understood the party has raised concerns about the Kyle Wilson proposal.A Labour source said the Nationalists were worried what would happena confirmatory vote resulted in another endorsement of Leave.The insider said the SNP is anxious about the Scottish Parliament being bound by the decision and the impact on another independence referendum.

He denies any criminality.The Herald on Sunday last month asked the Government for the number of emails that the offices of the First Minister and the Permanent Secretary received from Salmond, or his representatives, between January  last year and August .The content of any emails was not requested, just the number of communications, but the response stated: ldquoThe Scottish Government does not have the information you have asked for because while we retain key documents as appropriate, we do not keep a log of every email received on a topic.One insider said the answer was ldquostrange as a search of a relatively small number of staff inboxes would be ldquostraightforward.However, the response has raised further questions about the Governmentrsquos commitment to freedom of information.Sturgeon met Salmond three times last year to discuss the misconduct probe, but no minutes were taken of the meetings.It was also reported yesterday that Sturgeonrsquos officials blocked the release of a letter sent by the First Minister to Evans about her contact with Salmond.On January , the First Minister told MSPs: ldquoI was concerned that [a legal] challenge could be imminent, so I told the permanent secretary then that I knew about the investigation and I told her about the previous meeting, including the reference to a potential legal challenge.ldquoI told her that I supported her decision to investigate and that I would not seek to intervene in the investigation in any way.However, in response to an FoI request by the i newspaper, the Scottish Government said disclosure of the full letter ldquocould prejudice a case currently in court in Scotland.Sturgeonrsquos chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was also present at the meeting Sturgeon had with Salmond at her home, but her attendance was not in her official Government diary."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-looking-at-the-implications-of-returning-from-is","story":"EVERY day their numbers grow. There are now over , in detention, according to the most recent estimates, and those are only a result of the latest fighting.Last Wednesday, more than  members of the Islamic Stategroup, most of them foreign fighters holed up in the enclave of Baghouz in eastern Syria, gave themselves up.Thousands more women and children, many of them the wives of these same IS cadres, are already cramming the camps set up for those displaced as the jihadist terror group disintegrates in the last slither of territory that remains of their once self-proclaimed caliphate that spread across swathes of Syria and Iraq in an area roughly the size of Britain.And speaking of Britain, back here it takes a lot to get people talking about a news story beyond Brexit, but the ongoing debate over what should be done about Shamima Begum is one such story.For the past week, the issue of whether the nine-months pregnant woman, now aged , should be repatriated has polarised British public opinion. The debate over her fate is not the first and will certainly not be the last over what do with foreign fighters and supporters of IS as the detention camps of northern Syria fill up and the challenges posed likewise mount up.With so much polemical heat surrounding the Begum case, itrsquos perhaps worth stepping back and pausing for a moment to cast some badly-needed light on this controversial issue.For itrsquos precisely at this moment that so many complex and serious questions need well thought out solutionsan already pressing and dangerous situation is not to be made worse.To begin with this is not a problem thatrsquos going anywhere fast. Itrsquos thought that up to , international citizens from  countries joined IS in Iraq and Syria between April  and June , according to a report by the highly-respected International Centre for the Study of Radicalisationat Kings College London, published last year.To put this in some context and perspective, currently on the ground the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces say they are struggling to cope with the responsibility of holding the IS detainees from  countries that they have in custody.ldquoWe canrsquot do it alone, says Abdulkarim Omar, a leader of the Kurdish-led foreign-relations commission, which is affiliated with the US-backed SDF. ldquoEveryone is running away from the responsibility, he insists.There is little doubt that the Kurdsrsquo fledgling administration lacks the resources and capacity to put on trial, or detain indefinitely, so many people. Itrsquos vital too that they are in a position to carry out detentions under humane and sustainable conditions over an extensive period of time, something that cannot be done without the advice and support from foreign states and other international bodies.In Syriarsquos Kurdish enclave the leftist ideology embraced there means a rejection of the death penalty and focuses on rehabilitation rather than punishment for those foreign fighters captured. This is dferent from Iraq where the Western-backed government often carries out the death penalty, earning the condemnation of Western human-rights groups.Last week, Iraqi prime minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi said Iraq will repatriate Iraqi IS members held by SDF in Syria as well as thousands of their family members. A senior Iraqi intelligence official told reporters that up to , Iraqis, including IS fighters, their families and refugees will be brought back home by April where many of them will live in a tent settlement in western Anbar province.The official, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said IS members will be interrogated by Iraqi security agencies, a move that will give human rights groups cause for concern as to their potential fate.For the moment though itrsquos Syriarsquos Kurds who are shouldering most of the burden when it comes to dealing with the crisis. Faced with uncertainties over the their own future because of the impending withdrawal of US troops and the threat posed by Turkish forces, they remain caught between a rock and hard place both politically and strategically over those IS captives they have taken.ldquoThey are being held in an area that is not stable and any vacuum or chaos could allow them to break out of prison and it would be a burden and big danger, warns Abdulkarim Omar.These past weeks have only underscored such arguments along with the transnational scale of the problem captured foreign fighters present. Russians, families from central Asia, Ukrainians and Canadians were all reported to be among those to have fled Baghouz recently, providing a sharp reminder of the global scope of the IS jihadist organisation.A little less than a fortnight ago, as the Baghouz operation intensied, six foreign jihadists of ious nationalities who had actively participated in terrorist activities of the group for years were also captured, the SDF confirmed in a statement. The men are reportedly from Russia, Germany, Turkey, Sweden, Morocco and an unspecied country in Latin America.Although you could be forgiven for thinking so going by some media reports, the case of British woman Shamima Begum is far from unique.Among the civilians fleeing Baghouz recently was a German woman who also came to live under IS as a -year-old. Meanwhile, a woman identied by a French news agency as Leonora, now , escaped to a screening centre for the displaced where she described travelling to Syria two months after converting to Islam. She became the third we of a German IS fighter named Martin Lemke, bearing him two children in Syria. Her husband was detained by the SDF after the family fled the fighting. ldquoWe gave up together, she said.Faced with such a erse range of nationalities, Kurdish officials have reached out to all countries with citizens in detention, but few have responded.Kazakhstan, Russia, Sudan and Indonesia have repatriated some families. At least one American, a woman, and an Iraqi woman have also been ed to their countries, says Kurdish foreign-relations spokesman Omar.A huge part of the problem, of course, is that itrsquos near impossible to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution to what overall could be as many as ,-plus people the SDF and Kurdish authorities are holding.Many governments, especially Western ones, take the attitude that those who chose to join IS surrendered their citizenship rights when they decided to leave their countries, Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue recently told the Washington Post after visiting northeastern Syria and interviewing detainees.ldquoThe broader argument is: You went over there, you renounced your citizenship, and you joined an organisation that gave no second chances to anyone, he said.Added to this are the understandable concerns of some foreign authorities that ees might not be genuine in their remorse and could spread radical ideology or plot future attacks, says Amarasingam.Some observers, however, see this as a ldquodistracting fear. Joseph Horowitz, senior legal officer for the Open Society Justice Initiative, whose specialisms include human rights, national security and counterterrorism, says that first and foremost people ldquoneed to be assessed on an inidual basis rather than be subjected to collective assumptions and attitudes that are one step away from a presumption of guilt.Radicalisation, Horowitz argues, remains in many instances  and is often injected with discriminatory religious and cultural stereotypes about who performs ldquoradicalisation, who can be ldquoradicalised and what constitutes indicators of ldquoradicalisation.Such observations, however, will do little to allay the fears of those already uneasy about the labyrinthine legal terrain that exists over ees. In many instances for example itrsquos far from clear whether there would be enough evidence to prosecute and imprison many of those coming back, especially in Western countries where evidentiary standards are high. In this respect the chaos in Syria works in the favour of ees.Ali Soufan, a former FBI investigator who now runs the Soufan Centre, dedicated to the deradicalisation of extremists, says that unless they were well-known figures or featured in videos committing war crimes as in the case of British Arab Mohammed Emwazi ndash nicknamed Jihadi John ndash it would be dficult to make any charges other than minor ones stick.Some ees says Soufan might also claim they only travelled to help fellow Muslims in distress and were unaware of ISrsquos atrocities, a claim that on more that one occasion has already been made by those choosing to come back from Syria and Iraq. Such legal conundrums are only set to increase as the number of ees gains momentum.Already Western European countries have seen a total of , nationals , according to the ICSR study. In another analysis of six EU countries, carried out by the European Parliament, half of those who left the UK have ed, the highest rate among the six countries examined.By and large though the pattern by which IS ees are dealt with in EU countries is based on criminal investigation and risk assessment. Rehabilitation and reintegration scheme have also been introduced inside and outside prison. Other measures include restrictions on movement, and powers to withdraw and refuse to issue passports.Here in the UK, for some time the Government has been seeking to block theof anyone considered a security threat with a range of legal powers.Many of the known IS members who were dual nationals have had their British citizenship removed, like members of the ldquoBeatles cell of which Mohammed Emwazi was part, before his death.This citizenship removal invalidates their travel documents and means the UK can avoid responsibility for repatriating them from Syria or future legal proceedings. The most recent official statistics show that  people were deprived of British citizenship in  and  in .The power has been used for criminals as well as terrorists, and the law allows it in cases ldquoconducive to the public good.But making a person stateless is against international law, so it can only be used for dual nationals and last November two cases were ruled unlawful.In the coming weeks and months the use of all these measures will be stepped up as the UK Government seeks to reassure a nervous public.ldquoAny British citizen who doesfrom taking part in the conflict must be in no doubt they will be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted, Theresa Mayrsquos official spokesperson was at pains to point out last Thursday as the furore around Shamima Begum intensied.Speaking around the same time while attending the Munich security conference, Alex Younger, the head of Britainrsquos Secret Intelligence Service , warned that ISrsquos threat is likely to ldquomorph and spread and its threat is ldquodefinitely not done.He cautioned about showing triumphalism at the demise of IS.ldquoThe military defeat of the caliphate does not represent the end of the terrorist threat that we face, he said.Like it or not, dealing effectively with ees will play a vital part in neutralising that threat. This is not the time, as many have suggested, to say ldquolet them rot in Syria.For most likely they will not but instead be recycled into the jihadi cause."},{"url":null,"title":"two-thirds-of-organic-land-in-scotland-has-disappeared","story":"And yet, almost unnoticed, Scotland has lost its early lead. Two-thirds of what was once organic land has reverted to conventional farming just as other nations soar ahead. Scots, hit by first the financial crash and then Brexit uncertainty, consume far less chemical-free food than most other western Europeans.Even after years of gradual increase in demand, the total market for organic food and drink in Scotland last year was less than a twentieth of that of Denmark, a country of roughly the same size.In  the Scottish Government moved to stall the decline with a new plan of subsidies and support. The number of producers is at a six-year-high and the amount of land farmed originally has stabilised.But with reforming agriculture now a global climate change priority, can Scotland, and its multi-billion-pound food and drink industry, now catch back up with faster-moving rivals The ShoppersWilliam Swanson knows his food. Or rather, he knows what can be in his food. And that worries him.The retired analytical chemist is doing his messages, squinting at the ingredients and provenance of some chilled tofu.After a career checking, among other things, how much pesticide or herbicide is in what we eat, Mr Swanson takes care of himself.So he, we Janette and daughter Louise - all vegetarians - are browsing in Locavore, a store on Glasgowrsquos Southside which sells mostly organic or local produce. His concern  Chemicals. His wersquos  Plastics.ldquoI am really worried about plastics and all the extra packaging you have these days,rsquo Mrs Swanson. ldquoHere you bring your own bottle and fill it with shampoo.rsquo Behind her, customers are doing the same with milk from a tap on big stainless steel fridge.Reuben Chesters likes what she is saying. He runs Locavore. He waves towards his green-grocery section where there is barely any plastic, bar bags of salad. Locavore packages some of its greens - often from its own small-holding in East Renfrewshire - in plastics. But they are biodegradable, made from thistles. Most of his shoppers pick up their loose veg and pop in in their own bags - or paper ones.But concerns in to plastics and pesticides - the traditional drivers of organic shoppers - now fit in to a bigger picture: global warming.The RetailerLater, perched on a old-style dustbin full of loose rice, Mr Chesters, , explains that people come in to his store for a whole bunch of reasons - not least the coffees served in s beige cups and saucers at tables next to big picture windows,Some are health conscious, he says. Some are environmentally conscious. Some both.But why did he get involved  ldquoClimate change is my initial driver, he says. ldquoAlong the way, everything  has got tied in with it, overall sustainability, for employees and suppliers and packaging and the wider natural environment,ldquoBut climate change is a huge part of it. Food is very often overlooked as a cause of global warming. Food is a third of all greenhouse gases, before we start tying in transport and energy production related to it.That makes Locavore, its aisles floors lightly dusted in good clean earth from loose boxes of organic root veg and its walls painted autumnal yellow, the front line in the war against global warming. It and an entire global movement to make food and farming more sustainable.Agriculture accounts for around a third of carbon emissions, compared with perhaps a th for aviation. Why  Party because conventional farming uses vast quantities of fertilisers made using fossil fuels. The take-away:we want to save the planet, we are going to need to change the way we farm. What kind of farming avoids chemical fertilisers  Organic.Tackling climate change, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, is a global and Scottish policy priority. So what are national and local authorities doing to support change in farming The IssueScience - and the the United Nations - is on Mr Chesters side. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation backs low-impact farming, using a combination of old customs and new technology. \"The lower-input of fossil fuel dependant resources and the use of renewable energy all present opportunities for organic agriculture to lead the way in reducing energy consumption and mitigating the negative affects of energy emissions,\" it says.The Scottish Government agrees. It has a plan to reboot Scottish organic farming. Its objective is far from hidden: \"An increase in the proportion of land managed organically,\" it declareds, \"will ultimately help to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\"That, at least, is the aspiration. The reality is rather dferent. Mr Chesters is quickly upscaling Locavore, which has its own smallholdings producing salads and even livestock and a chain of loyal suppliers.But it is far from always easy to source Scottish organics, even for some of the nations iconic produce. Fancy home-grown organic strawberries  Rapeseed oil  Ayrshire tatties  They do not exist. A single orchard is trying to grow organic apples.Organic advocates are quick to stress the commercial market for produce has been growing steadily for seven years. The Soil Association, which certies producers as organic, measured the entire UK market at pound. billion in , its highest ever figure. That amounted to . per cent of all Britains food and drink. A lot  Yes, but not by international standards.There is no Scottish breakdown of that number but separate figures suggest the market is disproportionately small north of the border.The Scottish Government cites data from consumer intelligence firm Kantar World suggesting sales of organic groceries were up some . per cent in the year to March , to roughly pound million.That compares with a figure in Denmark, which is roughly the same size as Scotland, of more than pound. billion in . More than  per cent of Danish groceries are organic. That is the highest figure in the world. In Sweden the figure is nine per cent in Germany more than five in France more than four.And yet it used to be Scotland that was ahead of the game. Back in  some . per cent of farmland was certied organic. The figure is now hovering at . per cent, having risen in , for the first time in a decade, to , hectares. Across the UK the organic acreage fell from . per cent to . of all farmland.Meanwhile, in the rest of the European Union, the trend is the exact office. The share of EU land farmed organically has jumped from . per cent in  to . per cent in .There is a a slight health warning on the scale of Scotlands \"crash\" in organic acreage. Some of the decline comes from hill farms which have deserted certication schemes, finding the extra expense of going organic was not delivering premium prices for their lamb. These businesses may have owned a lot of rough grazing land but they may not have produced much meat.The Big EstateOne of the big hill farming businesses to drop out of Scotlands organic scheme was Atholl Estates, effectively three or four huge chunks of Highland Perthshire.It is , hectares in total. The equivalent of nearly half Scotlands current total organic land area. It had been an early adopter of organics. So quitting was not taken lightly.Its general manager, Andrew Bruce Wootton, blamed demand. Just not enough Scots were ready to pay more.\"Sadly, I think it was the loss of premium prices in the market probably caused of downsizing in the organic acreage,\" he said. \"Pre-financial crash there was a very healthy premium, particularly in the aftermath of mad cow disease and other food scares.\"People were concerned about how their food was produced and where it came from. Economic pressures have put pay to that discretion.\"Mr Bruce Wootton cited other problems with being organic. His estates centre-piece, Blair Castle, missed weedkiller on its lawns and gardens. Its appearance, he said, started to \"worsen\".But Mr Bruce Wootton raised another issue. There are strict rules on what counts as organic. You can lose certication - and subsidies, such as they are,you flout them. But that does not mean that conventional farmers or producers cannot use some organic methods.\"We maintain a lot of the standards and approaches the organic scheme taught us,\" he said. \"So there is a legacy improvement to the environment but the scheme was not making commercial sense to us.\"The agronomistPeter Lindsay, breaking off from ploughing a field at his farm, Wemyss, near Forfar, echoes Mr Bruce Woottons warnings on price.But he admits that is far from always commercially easy, not least for farmers selling a premium product, such as grass-fed Scotch Beef. Consumers do not, he reckons, want to pay for two premiums, one for for a quality provenance and another for organic.Mr Lindsay works for SAC Consulting, a spin-off firm of Scotland Rural College, SRUC. One of his jobs is to help farmers go organic. So he knows the score.ldquoThe credit crunch made things dficult. People did not have spare cash. Demand dropped. But now I think we are seeing an increase again.Mr Lindsay things the demand is coming first for cheaper produce, vegetables rather than prime beef. But the thing about organic farming is that it is particularly well suited to a traditional mixed farm producing a whole range of produce, from potatoes to cereals to meat.That is because organic farmers rotate their fields, from livestock to dferent plants. ldquoWith more organics, ldquoMr Lindsay explains. ldquoYou wonrsquot see fields of monoculture. Yoursquoll see more weeds. And yoursquoll see more wildle as beetles and other bugs come back - and the birds and animals that feed on them. And there are more native breeds, animals more suited to our grass.But with just two per cent of Scotland farmed this way, Mr Lindsay acknowledges it will be a while before Scotlandrsquos agricultural landscape reverts back to is old image.ldquoOrganic is still niche. I cannot see the tide turning completely. There is a long way to go before we notice an impact. In some ways, organics is easier for Scottish farmers. Because itrsquos ato traditional methods. It is all very much grass-based. More organic farming might just mean Scotland starts to look more like itself.The farmerThat is how is how Robert Shanks feels. He has a dairy farm, Queenscairn, near Kelso, and has recently gone back to organic milk after a few years of conventional. His voice brightens up when he talks about his new-ish herd: Frisians. ldquoI love the black and whites,rsquo he says. ldquoMy grandfather started with them in . They eat our grass and here in the Borders we have as good grass as anywhere.When he was making non-organic milk he had Holsteins, an American breed that has bigger yields than Frisians, but which rely more on extra food than the more traditional British animal.ldquoIt is like a turkey that cannot fly, he said of the foreign cow. ldquoAll they do is have feed shoved down their necks. That feed, of course, is not organic. The cost of organic cereals or soy for as animal feed is prohibitively high. Hence a switch to native breeds.But that comes at a cost. Mr Shanksrsquos Frisians produce - per cent less milk than his old Holsteins. That is  litres less of the white stuff per cow per year.Mr Shanks, who has  cows, has no problem with friends and neighbours, some of whom have more than  animals, sticking with conventional farming. Like Mr Bruce Wootton at Atholl Estates he stresses there are plenty of good clean Scottish producers who are not organic but still pretty environmentally responsible.ldquoSome people pooh-pooh organic farming, he explains. ldquoBut I say it is like farming  years ago but with modern equipment. I think it is the modern way. I do think there is an overuse of chemicals.ldquoI think the government has abdicated responsibility on food policy to the supermarkets. That is why we have obesity and poor health. And it is why farmers are not making much money - I am living proof of that. Yet we are producing a surplus of food but wersquore not rich. That doesnrsquot make any sense.Mr Shanks loves clover, the way farmers like his grandfather, also Robert, kept their grazing lush and green. This little plant helps fix nitrogen in his grass, boosting growth, rather than the chemical fertilisers most farmers use. It is not quite as effective. But it works. That gets Mr Shanksrsquo Frisians their dinner. And, he swears, it makes their milk tastier.ldquoEverybody thinks their product is good,\" he says with pride. \"But I think my milk tastes better, because the grass-fed cows produce more butterfat.\"The DairyRobert Graham buys Mr Shanks milk, all of it. Hes managing director of Scotlands biggest independent dairy, Grahams. Organic business is doing well for him, with year-on-year growth, he says, \"in the teens\".A few years ago over breakfastMr Graham dreamt up a new product, or rather than old one: organic non-homogenised milk in a bottle. Or milk, as it used to be called, with cream on the top. \"It has a dferent taste profile,\" he says. \"And it has been phenomenal and is selling in Waitrose and Sainsburys across the UK.\"A litre of Mr Grahams whole organic milk sells in Waitrose for pound., in a recyclable PET bottle. The same quantity in Locavore is roughly the same, pound., though you have to bring your own refillable container.Those prices, in most supermarkets, would buy you more a standard four-pint, .L plastic bottle of conventional semi-skim.The GovernmentPolicy-makers know high prices for organics will depress the market, not least with Brexit uncertainty on the horizon.So the state - with its climate change agenda - has to pick up some of the slack. That means subsidies - and public procurement, for school, military or hospital dinners - to push demand to a scale where prices can come down off their heights.Take rich Denmark again. Its government last year announced a package of subsidies of nearly poundm for its organic sector in -. Ministers in Copenhagen are snfing export opportunities too. \"We are seeing places where the middle class is growing and demand becoming larger. We see it particularly in China, its food and environment minister, Esben Lunde Larsen, told Ritzau, a news agency.And Scotland  Conventional food and drink experts are booming. So is the domestic market. So what is the Government here doing to support the sht to organics  It is currently offering subsidies through something called its called Agri-Environment Climate Scheme. A spokeswoman valued such support at poundm. That is not poundm this year. That is the figure for total subsidies, including a predecessor fund, ever, to date. True, there is also free advice on hand for farmers.Back in , just as figures underlined the scale of decline, the Government announced a plan to increase organics. It ends next year but has no specic targets. How can we measure its success  A spokeswoman said: \"We do not support the idea of a land target as conversion to organic is a business decision for each farmer.\"The planrsquos vision is to have a vibrant, successful, sustainable, world-renowned Scottish organic food and farming sector by . We are currently assessing progress with delivery of the plan.\"There is some good news, she said, the number of organically certied producers was up in , to a six-year-high.The Government, meanwhile, does not buy much organic good. It is investing in Food for Le, a scheme that helps schools purchase local or organic food for lunches Only two Scottish councils, north and east Ayrshire, have managed to get full gold awards under the project. That means  per cent of what goes in their dinners is organic.Scaling up this scheme, whisper organic market watchers, could be revolutionary. Producers selling to the state, even at low margins, could scale up and cut costs. The dference, they argue, between selling by the cardboard box, and by the palet, is huge.The LobbyChampions of organic farming sound upbeat. David Michie, of Soil Association Scotland, concedes the industry took a hit after the financial crisis, from -. Demand, is recovering, but by the very nature of farming, supply is taking time to catch. \"Perhaps inevitably, farmers did not see organic as a viable option after ,\" he said. \"As sales in the market picked up again, there was a lag between this sales growth and the amount of land farmed organically because the conversion period to organic from conventional farming is two years.\"Mr Michie said more and more businesses are applying for the conversion subsidies from the government, \"in part because support payments are guaranteed for the next five years... but also because organic sales have been growing.\"The Soil Association - which has been supporting organic farming for decades before it became trendy in the s and early s - backed the Scottish Government approach.Mr Michie said: \"In the past wersquove found that targets have been counterproductive because increasing production is not always matched by increasing consumption.\"Having organic farming as a National Priority, where farmers are helped to get access to conversion and maintenance support, is more appropriate.\"The ShoppersBack at Locavore in Govanhill, the Swansons have thousands of whole or organic products to choose from, many Scottish. But are they too expensive  Is organics a middle-class fad  Mr Swanson nods.\"If you look at some of the product, you would have to say thatit was not organic or locally sourced, it would be cheaper,\" he says. \"I think there is an argument to say it is for people with money.But there is a but, he reckons. Root vegetables or salads, even organic ones, are not expensive compared to ready meals. \"If you were prepared to make your meals from scratch, your food would be cheaper and tastier,\" he said.Mr Chesters listens. His food, he says, is price competitive with the supermarkets organic range. Locavore is a community interest company, so any profits are for public good. But he admits getting poor people to buy is \"tricky\"\"Our custom is overwhelmingly local, walking distance,\" he says.\"We dont have the basement prices or a Lidl or where-ever because we are doing this properly and doing things properly is expensive. We are conscious there are barriers.\" \"We have a good food fund, which is effectively a food bank we operate. We see food, and our spending on food, as a tool for social good.So when you buy a litre of our milk youre supporting the shop here as a living wage employer, youre supporting a local farmer and youre reducing plastic use.\""},{"url":null,"title":"time-for-a-cool-night-out-with-scotlands-top-adventurers","story":"The Herald on Sunday has lined up extreme adventurer Aldo Kane, wild swimmer Calum Maclean, explorer Hazel Robertson and parkour athlete Robbie Grfith for the first of our Cool Conversations series.In our debut event on March , Kane will join the three other ists to share their tips, insights, and answer burning questions from audience members on how they manage to pull off unimaginable feats and stunts.Kane, , was given the top spot in our Cool List, which is the basis for the new series of talks and debates.He is set to tell audience members all about becoming an adventurer, how he manages to achieve the impossible and what working with some of South Americas real narcos was actually like in the flesh.Maclean, a wild swimmer, is set to talk about making the transition from a regular job to plunging into ice-cold lakes for a living, while Hazel Robertson will share her experiences as the Royal Scottish Geographic Societys explorer in residence.The youngest of our , -year-old Robbie Grfith shot to fame online when he did his own free-running take on Trainspottings famous Choose Le scene.The film shows the parkour athlete leaping, rolling, flying and careering through Edinburgh streets while carrying out breathtaking stunts.Based around our Cool List, and staged by the prestigious Edinburgh Grand Hotel, attendees will get the chance to share some time, and a cocktail or two, with these boundary-pushing adventurers.Other Cool Conversations events will bring together some of the countrys coolest writers, musicians, mindfulness gurus, bloggers and creatives."},{"url":null,"title":"conspiracy-theories-indyref2-energy-prices-and-inclusive-education-herald-on-sunday-letters","story":"Families should not have to fight for support.

Mr Mackay implies those who do not believe government explanations for certain major events such as  , the moon landings or the assassination of President Kennedy are innumerate, paranoid, deranged weirdos.In doing so he disparages over , highly intelligent, educated and respected architects, physicists, civil engineers, explosives and demolition experts from across the world who have clearly stated that it is impossible for the twin towers to have collapsed as they did purely from fires on the upper floors caused by aircraft crashing into them.Rather than taking cheap shots at these experts, perhaps Mr Mackay might care to explain how they are all mistaken. Perhaps he could also explain how World Trade Centre  ndash which had not been struck by an aircraft ndash likewise suddenly collapsed. By applying the basic laws of physics to the destruction of the buildings, experts have proven that official explanations that fire caused their collapse are fraudulent.Regarding events in Dallas in , Mr Mackay likewise denigrates the thousands of scientists, ballistic experts, legal experts, film analysts and others who have debunked the official Warren Commission finding that a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, killed President Kennedy. Anyone who now believes that guff about Oswald must be seriously intellectually challenged.On the moon landings, Mr Mackay likewise dismisses as cranks the many top physicists and radiation specialists across the world who state categorically that it is impossible for living beings to survive passage through the lethal Van Allen radiation belts that exist between planet Earth and the moon. Official accounts that the astronauts were protected internally with massively heavy lead shields are beyond a joke.No astronauts have died after passing through the radiation for the straightforward reason that no manned spacecraft have ever traversed that expanse. Any Herald on Sunday reader who wishes to understand how the ldquomoon landings were actually faked in Hollywood studios would do well to purchase a copy of the truly astonishing documentary film American Moon by a real investigative journalist, Massimo Mazzucco.Arguably the biggest ldquoconspiracy theory of all relates that the mainstream press and its reporting is controlled by the ruling oligarchs.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time. It is up to us to keep fighting. There is parking available in the town so the problem can be overcome. That should be our war cry all the time.\"Sunday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Flexibility plea on new GP deal","story":"THE problems facing GPs in Caithness have been outlined to Scotlandrsquos health secretary Jeane Freeman by two north MSPs.Rhoda Grant and David Stewart.Labour representatives for the Highlands and Islands, met with Ms Freeman to express their concern about the new GP contract and the impact it could have on rural and remote areas.They were accompanied by Phil Wilson, a professor of primary care and rural health at the University of Aberdeen and a GP in Inverness.Also present was a Dingwall GP Miles Mack.Mrs Grant asked Ms Freeman for the face-to-face meeting at the Scottish Parliament and highlighted issues which GPs across the Highlands and Islands have raised with her and Mr Stewart.The doctors told the minister that five of the  permanent GPs in Caithness are likely to retire in the next five years.Ms Freeman heard that since  almost half of all permanent GP posts in the county have been vacant and partially replaced with short-term locum provision.Three practices have ceased to be independent contractors and have been taken over by NHS Highland.Concerns were also raised about the capacity for undergraduate teaching and the effect on retention and recruitment of GPs in remote areas.Doctors have told the MSPs that the new contract fails to recognise the workload in rural areas where surgeries deal with a far greater range of medical problems, including emergencies that would be dealt with in hospitals in urban areas.Mrs Grant said: ldquoThe main concern is that whatrsquos on the table with the new contract is an urban model and this just doesnrsquot suit remote and rural areas.ldquoGPs are worried it will cause poor continuity of care for patients and that procedures currently performed at surgeries are being centralised ndash for instance for blood tests or vaccinations.ldquoThis will inevitably inconvenience patients and worsen health outcomes by raising barriers to care.ldquoThe contract states that other healthcare professionals will be employed to deal with these extra tasks ndash but with rural GP posts remaining unfilled, and shortages of nurses in many areas, how can we expect to find these extra people in our out-of-the-way places ldquoThere must be flexibility for GPs to retain the old system of care.The new contractrsquos funding formula has been based on the number of appointmentsand does not take account of the issues faced by rural areas such as patient and doctor travel.ldquoGPs in our region cannot wait for another three years to see some movement on this and Irsquom hopeful that the health secretary will find a suitable way forward.At the meeting Ms Freeman said she had ldquogenuinely taken the issues seriously and discussion would continue with colleagues.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupSunday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Not just in the services they provide, but, as one of the biggest employers in Highland, council jobs are fundamental to the sustainability of many communities. So a budget for jobs is really good news for people.ldquoA key element of the feedback we received is that we have many cumbersome, complicated and bureaucratic processes. We need to do things dferently, streamlining processes, be more outward looking and adopt best practice.ldquoAn overwhelming message is that we need to be more efficient. Basically, we need to get a grip on our expenditure. As a result we have been examining every budget line and turning over every stone, to make sure that we are getting the best results from the resources being used and challenging where performance can be improved.ldquoIf you always do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. It is time to change how we do things and so this is a budget for change.\"The change fund is an exciting element of our budget strategy and will underpin our programme of change over the coming year.Council leader Margaret Davidson said: ldquoThis is a decent, thoughtful and ambitious budget which will help move us into the future, protecting jobs and services.\"It aims to set the council on a journey of much needed change. We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future.

After all these glib, old charlatans had done to crush their hopes and lay waste to their futures, there they were, refusing to be beaten or to surrender to the nihilism of their elders.With their banners aloft, in cities across the country, they stood as a rebuke to the Brexiteers and the climate change deniers, who have shrugged off their responsibilities like Bullingdon tailcoats. Taking to the streets so soon after MPs voted against the negotiating position they had endorsed a fortnight earlier, the strikers’ principled stance made Westminster’s shallow and shambolic politicking at a time of national crisis seem even more crass. The children’s resolve should have shamed those politicians and their hangers-on. It would have shamed Tories of yore. But, as we long ago established, this lot are beyond shame. And so, instead of reflecting on their own inadequacy, they chose to double down on the protesters, trolling them in language so lacking self-awareness it felt like they were set-up lines for some awful joke. Theresa May, who has frittered away the past two years, castigated the children for time-wasting Andrea Leadsom , who has achieved precisely naught in this process, threw up her hands in horror at their “truancy” and Toby Young, who swallowed and perpetuated all the Brexit spin, accused them of falling for “crude propaganda”.When did the baiting of young people become the leisure pursuit of choice for angry, white commentators who dismiss them as conformist, then call for them to be suspended for skipping a single school day Despite studying harder and facing a more precarious jobs market than previous generations, they are relentlessly denigrated by hostile nonentities with a fraction of their insight or spirit. And they cannot win. If they are not apathetic, they are virtue signalling. If they don’t have opinions, they are ignorant but dittothey do. Last week they were criticised for being uncouth by allies of Jacob Rees-Mogg after he had defended Boer War concentration camps on the grounds that they had the same mortality rate as Glasgow at that time.You only had to watch Piers Morgan shout down Green MSP Ross Greer as he tried to voice dissenting views on Winston Churchill to understand what they are up against. Morgan is the acme of middle-aged entitlement the template for the kind of men who so fear the ebbing away of their power, they treat every bold new idea as a threat to be extinguished.Those of us who despise these figures, seize on the images of the striking children with a desperation born of watching our country systematically dismantled.In the US, it was the survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre who rekindled hope in a nation worn down by its leader’s refusal to do anything to halt the succession of school shootings.Emma Gonzalez held Republican politicians to account for taking money from the National Rle Association and got called a “skinhead lesbian” by a GOP candidate for her trouble.For others, however, the rally was evidence that the next generation was the answer to our prayers that one day, the current crop of amoral dissemblers would be swept away by these amazing campaigners.Here in the UK, it is those school pupils who refuse to sit back and let the planet expire that are keeping us the right side of sanity. Inspired by Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, these children are determined to force governments to prioritise climate change.Young accused Thunberg of peddling hoods because she said no action had so far been taken when, of course, hundreds of countries signed up to the Kyoto protocol and the Paris Agreement. Well, Toby, aren’t you the big man, picking up on a -year-old’s word choice, while ignoring her broader point  You founded a free school and yet you sneer at these children instead of trying to harness their energy. I bet you let out a victory whoop when you thrash your kids at tennis.The striking children were also criticised because they weren’t being specic enough about what they \u2028wanted politicians to do asit’s reasonable to expect teenagers to have written up a -point plan for stopping the polar ice caps from melting when world leaders have failed to make any serious impact. This hostile attitude was mirrored by the politan police who – having turned a blind eye to the aggressive pro-Brexit yellow vests – were seen putting several teenagers in handcuffs.Although the temptation to treat the climate change strikers as mini-Messiahs is strong, we have to be realistic. Those who took part will be a mish-mash of genuine activists, the curious and kids who just fancy missing double maths. Some of them may – as has been suggested – be calling for others to make grand gestures, while leaving their phones on charge all night .But, at a time when so many politicians are out only for what they can get, these children are taking a stand. Wiser than their years, they understand climate change ought to be top of the agenda. They can see our politicians are too busy “taking back control” from the EU to take back control of climate change policy and meet our own greenhouse gas emissions target. And they know education is about more than sitting in a classroom.By striking, the pupils are shouldering the responsibility that rightly belongs to adults. They are shining a harsh light on the feckless and the greedy the do-littles who have allowed so much of the world’s animal le to be wiped out on their watch.Fortunately, these kids are only a few years off voting age. Judging by their chants of “F*** off Theresa May,” they won’t be backing the Tories, but the fact they are already politically active increases the prospect of them participating in the democratic process. By the time the Brexiteers are toasting their own wickedness in their special place in hell, some of them could well be in power. In the next few weeks, we may pay the price of governmental indference and crash out of the EU with a No Deal. Shop shelves could be stripped bare and medicines impossible to come by. All this while David Attenborough is warning of the potential collapse of civilisations.But look at all those bright, shiny faces beacons of hope on a desolate landscape.

He also had – less ferocious, it must be said – criticism of the PM. May’s continued refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit was disappointing, he said.What’s more, the Malthouse Compromise – an agreement drawn up between Tory MPs backing both Remain and Leave which suggests the use of technology to maintain an open border in Ireland – was, said Harrington, “fancul nonsense”.We are used, by now, to backbenchers in the Commons speaking their minds about Brexit. Whether it’s Rees-Mogg opining about the need for the most Brexity Brexit possible, or his colleague, Anna Soubry, making the case that any kind of Brexit will be a disaster for the UK, those who don’t feel the restrictions of office have been enthusiastic in sharing their views.But when a government minister speaks up, using the sort of language employed by Harrington, that’s a whole new ball game. And I’d like to hear more of it.The Prime Minister convinces nobody when, through a rictus grin, she speaks of the possibility of post-Brexit harmony. Doesn’t she, in fact, look weak and unsure as she tries to herd the feral cats of her party’s rightmost wing So Harrington’s furious intervention brings us some clarity about the problems the ERG and their fellow pro-Brexit MPshave created with their blanket refusal to consider any kind of compromise.This sort of outspokenness is to be encouraged.Perhaps moderate Labour frontbenchers – by which I mean shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer – might feel emboldened to be similarly frank about the treachery of those in his own party who, despite claiming to stand up for the poorest in society, are – even now – preparing to help the Prime Minister deliver a Brexit that stands to cause deep and lasting damage to the UK economy. And while he’s about it, maybe he could speak more clearly about the appalling failure of the Labour leadership to do anything approaching useful about the abhorrent anti-Semitism that now disfigures his party.Let Richard Harrington be your guide, Keir. Go on. Speak your mind.The SNP could also do with some straight-talking from those in authority. A group of MPs including Joanna Cherry and Angus MacNeil are currently engaged in a campaign to force the First Minister’s hand on the issue of a second referendum. Nicola Sturgeon’s preference is to take things more slowly. Only last week she said she would like to see how Brexit plays out before calling for the powers to hold indyref.This makes perfect sense. Voters are ided as never before and the idea that, amidst this political turbulence, a new Yes campaign might cut through and bring about a majority in favour of the break-up of the UK is utterly fancul.Perhaps a wise authority figure – deputy First Minister John Swinney, say – might have a public word. Those who rebel against the leadership position are doing the nationalists’ cause absolutely no favours at all.Political leaders find it dficult to speak truth to their parties. Splits over policy and strategy require those in charge to do what they can to keep everyone happy. This diplomacy is, by and large, a good thing. If dferences of opinion can be contained and smoothed over, a party can convincingly present itself as a broad church.But sometimes those dferences of opinion are of such a magnitude that no amount of desperate spin can hide the splits. To ying degrees, the Tories, Labour and the SNP are now split over how they should tackle big constitutional questions. The stable governance of the country is not helped by circumstances where small cabals of extremists are indulged by their leaders.Harrington expressed an exasperation that will be familiar to many of us. He has watched as a small group of right-wingers have held the government and – by extension – the country to ransom. And now he has decided that enough is enough. May has allowed this bizarre situation to develop because of her unwillingness to stand up to these critics, to these zealots who would throw her under a bus given half a chance.Constitutional change can never – no matter what its most enthusiastic proponents would have us believe – be an entirely painless process. By its very nature it is isive and creates uncertainty. But, here we are, facing these big questions about both the UK’s place in the world and Scotland’s place in the UK.If we are to find our way through these minefields, we will not be helped by giving credence to the arguments of extremists for whom compromise and pragmatism are dirty words.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"laura chow revise law to give charity lotteries vital boost","story":"A decade of crises, an era of conflict and tragedy with displaced people, high levels of isolation and loneliness and a breakdown in trust. Yet despite  years of global chaos there remains one truth # people continue to care. They care about their community, they fret and worry about the next generation and, in particular, about our planet. And we have a resilient and determined Third Sector to back them.So many charities throughout the UK and across the globe have endured a torrid time following the  financial crash and year after year of austerity. Public sector cuts – mainly local authorities having to rationalise – led to a greater focus on statutory duties while many of the services we count on have been picked up by charities stepping in to fill the gap. Last year in Scotland four out of five people used a third sector organisation – although, remarkably, only a quarter were even aware that they had.And now, in the final throes of Brexit, countless charities are facing the threat that millions in EU funding may be cut. Those EU cuts will force charities to turn to new income streams, even the smallest, locally-run organisations will feel competition grow. The impact may even be felt by the very people in communities who came together to address their own needs during the years of austerity, including some in Scotland, where  per cent of charities are local.However, even through what history will regard as an age of major financial uncertainty, the third sector, in its quest for fairness and equality, continues to gain public support.More than one million people volunteered  million hours of their time in Scotland last year. We have , charity trustees across the country and, according to the Charities Aid Foundation Scotland Giving Report, in , across Scotland, people gave an estimated £. billion to charity,  per cent more than the year before. At People’s Postcode Lottery, we have strict selection criteria for good causes to be supported. Trust is key to these long-term relationships which focus on transparency, honesty, integrity and mutual dependence. We trust our beneficiary organisations to put our players’ funds to the best possible use year after year.Since launching  years ago, People’s Postcode Lottery has awarded £ million to good causes. The figure rises substantially each month.Funding comes through  grant-giving trusts and People’s Postcode Lottery operates society lotteries for  other good causes. A decade ago  per cent of ticket sales went to good causes but that percentage has now risen to  per cent. Players sign up with their postcode and pay £ a month to be automatically entered into every draw. Prizes are announced every day of the month.The majority of our funding, in addition to being long-term, is unrestricted. We believe charities are experts in their fields and know where funds can be used best. Charities supported choose how to spend the money they receive. However, charity lotteries are the only type of fundraising which has limits imposed on it by law. People’s Postcode Lottery is working hard to update the legislation. We want to ensure charities can get the maximum amount of funding possible, which in turn will benefit people, places and charities throughout Scotland and the UK.This can be achieved with a straightforward change to the current legislation and at no cost to the taxpayer. Following calls on the UK government for reforms to the legislation, their public consultation last year set out their preferred option of a £m annual sales limit, up from £m. The current limit has been in place since  and the government have been considering reforming the current limits for more than five years, so we can expect the new limit – whatever it is set at – to remain in place for some time to come. Now, with charities facing such a tough funding environment, updating the law on charity lotteries is one sure way for the UK government to get more funds to the charity sector at no cost to either the taxpayer or the Treasury.Laura Chow is Head of Charities at the People’s Postcode Lottery©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit high noon could see theresa may lose six ministers","story":"A dozen or more government ministers could quit by the end of the monthPrime Minister Theresa May refuses to extend the Brexit negotiating period beyond  March, a leading Tory opponent of EU withdrawal has said.Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the next round of Brexit votes on  February would be a “high noon” moment when resignations on this scale – which he said could include six Cabinet members – might bring Mrs May’s government down.He was speaking as Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt made clear his unwillingness to accept a no-deal departure, telling hardline Brexiteers in a tweet: “We are not leaving without a deal. If you want to leave, you’d better agree one.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-ROADS-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits. This treatment represents a marked worsening of prisoner attitudes from that of the prison staff in Brixton where the girls were during their hunger-strike.”Pay rise for home helpsHOME helps in the Andersonstown areas who were threatening strike action some months ago have just been given a big pay rise.The new rate for the job, which paid only p per hour this time last year, has climbed to p.After the reorganisation of local government services home helps who were working in the Antrim County Council area protested that they were being paid p an hour less than colleagues who were working in the area formerly controlled by Belfast Corporation.In some parts of Andersonstown women working within a hundred yards of each other were being paid at rates which were   p dferent.A pay rationalisation last December by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which now controls the district’s home helps, brought all of the women’s pay up to a standard rate of p per hour.Most of the women work at least ten hours per week, with the average time spent looking after old and housebound people being around  hours.Local Ads in paperPAULA’S Glen Road Shopping CentreLadies and Children’s Outfitters.

We want more than that.“There is no appetite to go around on a merry-go-round again in a circular conversation that winds up with the DUP either unable to deliver an accommodation or unwilling to deliver solutions to what are very legitimate asks, made in the spirit of equality and the spirit of powersharing.”The republican leader continued: “We are open to any credible proposition but we will not participate in anything that amounts to a sham.“People two years on deserve so much more than that, so much better.”I dont think Brexit should prevent us from having a government in Northern IrelandArlene FosterFacebookTwitterWith the UK Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule from Westminster, Northern Ireland has operated in a political limbo land for two years, with senior civil servants being left to run public services.Those civil servants are seriously hamstrung, with ongoing uncertainty over what decisions they are able to make in the absence of elected ministers.As a consequence, numerous governmental decisions are in abeyance with many major policy initiatives in cold storage.Mrs Foster called on Sinn Fein to get “serious” about restoring the institutions.“We need devolution back in Northern Ireland,” she said as she arrived for the talks with party MEP Diane Dodds.“It should have been back in after March , after that election.“It didn’t and it’s a source of great frustration at this point, not just for us but for the whole population of Northern Ireland, that we are still talking about talks rather than actually dealing with government issues.”Mrs Foster reiterated that her party would go back into devolved government immediately, insisting the outstanding political disputes could be resolved in parallel.Many believe the prospects of an imminentto powersharing are bleak, with the crisis seemingly in drt as political attention focuses on Brexit.Mrs Foster said that did not need to be the case, insisting the Brexit process should not be a barrier to restoring powersharing.“I don’t think Brexit should prevent us from having a government in Northern Ireland,” she said.“I wish that we had had a government up and running since March , that’s when we should have been back into government, instead, because Sinn Fein has refused to go back in, we have to deal with that.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The UK is leaving the European Union The DUP leader expressed hope that there would be a Brexit deal before March .“We want to see a deal in relation to Brexit because we believe a deal that works for the whole United Kingdom and one that deals for the European Union is good for everybody,” she said.On Brexit, Mrs McDonald said: “Brexit sets the scene and the tone for everything that happens now in Irish politics.“Here in the North people voted to remain, as Arleneis well aware, she defies that democratic decision, she advocates what, in our view, is a very, very reckless position in respect of Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37821795.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/7_National_Trust_me.jpg","title":"wells bars dup pair from his social media sites over lgbt vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9382323.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

The identities of the people giving the information to it would be withheld from the public and any information given would be “inadmissible in criminal and civil proceedings”.The public consultation on the plans asked a string of questions about the bodies above.However detailed proposals on two other key issues – the backlog of Troubles inquests and a Troubles pension – were not included in the consultation, with the government saying these are for a Stormont Executive to discuss.Sam McBride: Sinn Féin might hope the SDLP-Fianna Fáil alliance fails – but that would be short-sighted Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Sinn Feinsaid it met the victims commissioner on Monday.Afterwards it released a statement saying it had “expressed our concerns of the impact on victims who responded to the consultation in good faith only to be subjected to further delaying tactics by the British government”.It said: “It is clear there should be no more delays to the implementation of those legacy structures [in the Stormont House Agreement].”It said the lack of funding for legacy inquests “is not instilling any confidence among victims”, and added: “We also raised the issue of payments to all those injured as a result of the conflict.”Kenny Donaldson, SEFF’s services director, stated: “The Provisional movement through Sinn Fein is demonstrating once again its contempt for the democratic process. A public consultation into legacy issues has taken place and we await the outcome of those responses...“The NIO were clear in all public events they facilitated with SEFF the legacy structures will only proceed in the context of there being sufficient community confidence.“Sinn Fein may seek to bulldoze through their agenda [with a] suggestion the consultation was an implementation process of a political agreement, but this is grossly inaccurate.”The News Letter tried to establish how the , consultation responses stacks up against other large-scale government consultations.But when a string of departments – health, education, agriculture, the Executive Office, and the Northern Ireland Office itself – were asked for what the biggest consultations they had run had been, all failed to provide an answer.DUP HAS ITS SAY: The News Letter has documented in detail objections to the proposals during the public consultation.These have come from a wave of victims, parties, and other bodies – ranging from the Police Federationto the Orange Order .DUP South Belfast MP Emma Little Pengelly said consultation responses are still being digested, and “it is important that the voice of victims is acted upon from that process”.She said: “The DUP considers the best opportunity for justice to come from an investigatory team with full police powers. It is important that any new structures would be fair and proportionate, given % of deaths were caused by illegal terrorists, and there should be an end to witch hunts against those in the forces of law and order who acted bravely, honourably and appropriately.“SF wish only to advance their own narrow agenda, but the needs of innocent victims must be addressedwe are to make make progress.”INQUESTS:Whilst proposals on the Troubles inquest backlog did not form part of the legacy consultation, Sinn Fein last week continued its pressure forfunding to be released to deal with the issue.The News Letter had conducted a massive piece of research, published in May , which showed that of the  people on this inquest list, at least  were in paramilitary groups.A further breakdown showed a hugely-disproprtionate number of the outstanding inquests were into state-linked killings – with  of the  fatailities known or thought to have been killed by the state .try catch  TrendingTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieFacebook ban for P.S.N.I. - photo shared by police adjudged to have contravened community standardsMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so far          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in .
