As in countless council meetings in small cities across the country where mask mandates, teaching about race in schools and access to reproductive healthcare have become politically charged in America’s current climate, the night unfolded in a series of near-Shakespearean acts. On the morning the meeting was scheduled, Krista Wyatt, a former firefighter elected to city council in 2018 and the only member expected to vote against the ordinance, formally resigned. In an accompanying statement, Wyatt wrote: “There is a core group of people who have hijacked the council to force their personal, political and religious views on the entire citizenship of Lebanon. It is not fair to the citizens and is not the role of a City Council member to be a moral compass.” Dozens of people spoke at the meeting later that evening. Some sang, many shared deeply personal experiences of rape or miscarriages and a few even led prayers. Just outside the doors of city hall, pro-choice and anti-abortion groups similarly squared off, shouting at each other and urging passersby to honk in support of one side or the other. Ultimately though, the vote was a resolute 6-0, making Lebanon the 29th city in the nation, and the first city in Ohio, to pass an enforceable ordinance outlawing abortion within their city limits. As the nation waits for a supreme court ruling on abortion rights, pro-choice advocates and activists across the US know first-hand that any upcoming national ruling might be almost irrelevant given what’s already taken place in Ohio and beyond. For the last few months, small municipalities – many without any standing abortion clinics – like Lebanon, Mason and soon maybe others, have outlawed abortion. Though women in those cities can still travel to get an abortion, the bans send an intimidating message. Bypassing statehouses and targeting smaller towns and cities governed by council has emerged as a successful strategy for anti-abortion advocates in recent years. In July, a report from the Guttmacher Institute revealed that at least 30 towns in six states – Arkansas, Indiana, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Texas – have approved municipal abortion bans in the last three years. Some of these ordinances also target specific abortion funds and organizations providing other types of practical support to abortion patients. A jury has awarded more than $25m in damages against white nationalist leaders for violence that erupted during the deadly 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville. The defendants were accused of promoting and then carrying out racially motivated violence during the “Unite the Right” rally. After a nearly monthlong civil trial, a jury in US district court in Charlottesville deadlocked on two claims but found the white nationalists liable on four other counts in the lawsuit that was filed by nine people who suffered physical or emotional injuries during the two days of demonstrations. Attorney Roberta Kaplan said the plaintiffs’ lawyers plan to refile the suit so a new jury can decide the two claims this jury could not reach a verdict on. She called the amount of damages awarded from the other counts “eye opening”. The verdict, though mixed, is a rebuke to the white nationalist movement, particularly for the two dozen iniduals and organizations who were accused in a federal lawsuit of orchestrating violence against African Americans, Jews and others in a meticulously planned conspiracy. White nationalist leader Richard Spencer vowed to appeal. He said plaintiffs’ attorneys made it clear before the trial that they wanted to use the case to bankrupt him and other defendants. Lawyers for the plaintiffs invoked a 150-year-old law passed after the civil war to shield freed slaves from violence and protect their civil rights. Commonly known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, the law contains a rarely used provision that allows private citizens to sue other citizens for civil rights violations. A work crew spent several hours freeing the 884lb, 7ft statue from its pedestal in the council chambers and carefully maneuvering it into a padded wooden crate, for the short journey to the New York Historical Society. The city public design commission, appointed by the mayor, Bill de Blasio, voted earlier in the day to exile the statue, sculpted in 1833, on a 10-year loan. Opinions are mixed about the removal. Charles Barron, a member of the New York assembly and a former council member, told the New York Times: “It should be destroyed. A statue should be for those who we honor for their exemplary service and duty to all of this country, not just the white race.” But Michele Bogart, professor emeritus of art history at Stony Brook University, said the statue’s removal “deflects attention” from the actions of such controversial figures. “I have a philosophical problem with removing it from city hall,” she said. “If you can remove the Thomas Jefferson statue, then you can remove works from other city buildings.” Here’s where the day stands so far: Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned.The president and the vice-president -- joined by their spouses, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff -- are helping prepare meals for DC Central Kitchen’s clients. According to the White House, the non-profit prepares roughly 5,000 meals a day for homeless shelters, rehabilitation clinics and after-school programs in the DC area. After the event, the Bidens will head to Nantucket, where they will spend Thanksgiving with their family.Manchin, the Democratic chair of the Senate energy and natural resources committee, argued Biden should be undergoing a broader review of his approach to oil supply in the face of rising gas prices. “Today’s release from the strategic petroleum reserve is an important policy Band-Aid for rising gas prices but does not solve for the self-inflicted wound that shortsighted energy policy is having on our nation,” Manchin said in a statement. “I continue to call on President Biden to responsibly increase energy production here at home and to reverse course to allow the Keystone XL pipeline to be built which would have provided our country with up to 900,000 barrels of oil per day from Canada, one of our closest allies.” Of course, that position is extremely unpopular with environmentalists, who say the US is already not doing enough to combat the climate crisis.Granholm touted Joe Biden’s decision to release 50m barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, while acknowledging it will take time to see lower prices at the pump. “I’m not going to make a prediction about how much and how long,” Granholm said. “It won’t happen tomorrow, but it’ll happen over the next few weeks that people will hopefully start to see the difference.” The energy secretary added that the administration is focused on ensuring gas prices are “not being held artificially high” because of oil and gas companies’ profit-driven strategies. Biden sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission last week asking the agency to investigate “mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies”.Tarrio is about halfway through a five-month sentence for his illegal activity at a pro-Trump rally last December, during which he set fire to a stolen Black Lives Matter banner. Although Tarrio did not actually participate in the insurrection, the Proud Boys leader is believed to have been involved in the preparation for the Capitol attack, according to the select committee’s latest statement. (On a related note, Tarrio’s request for an early release from jail due to unsanitary conditions was just denied by a judge.)“We believe the iniduals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,” Thompson said in a statement announcing the latest round of subpoenas. “The Select Committee is moving swiftly to uncover the facts of what happened on that day and we expect every witness to comply with the law and cooperate so we can get answers to the American people.”The five new subpoenas were sent to the far-right groups Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and 1st Amendment Praetorian. Leaders of those groups -- Enrique Tarrio of Proud Boys, Elmer Stewart Rhodes of Oath Keepers and Robert Patrick Lewis of 1st Amendment Praetorian -- were also subpoenaed by the committee. Biden noted his administration is working to mitigate bottlenecks at ports by working to increase hours of operation at those sites, thus allowing more products to be delivered. The president said the number of containers sitting on docks has decreased in recent weeks, as shipping prices have also fallen. “More goods are moving more quickly and more cheaply out of our ports -- onto your doorsteps and onto store shelves,” Biden said. Noting that he recently met with the CEOs of companies like Walmart and Target, Biden added, “Families can rest easy: grocery stores are well-stocked with turkey and everything else you need for Thanksgiving. And the major retailers I mentioned have confirmed that their shelves will be well-stocked in stores this holiday season.” The president concluded his prepared remarks and did not answer any of the questions that reporters shouted at him as he departed."},{"url":null,"title":"high fees coupled with cost of rent means students are being priced out of education","story":" Al Fartukh from Ongar during a protest over Student fees on Molesworth Street, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsStudents protested outside Leinster House on Tuesday afternoon as part of three protests across the country calling for the cost of third-level education to be decreased.Cameron Carlile (18), who is in her first year of studying geospatial surveying at the Technological University of Dublin was one of the students protesting on Tuesday because of the “disgraceful” cost of college fees. “They are way too high. They should be lowered because students are trying to pay for accommodation and utilities for living on top of fees and it’s just not feasible for us,” she said. Ms Carlile is from north Co Wicklow and had to commute “at least an hour and a half each way every day”.She said the cost of transportation was “so high” but that the biggest impact on her was how “draining” the daily commute is. “I’m exhausted going into college and leaving college. It means I can’t get to social events after classes and enjoy my first year,” she said. Ms Carlile said she would prefer to live in Dublin but it “wasn’t possible” for her due to the worsening student accommodation crisis. Speaking to the , Claire Austick, president of the Union of Students Ireland (USI) said students had been “suffering” as a result of “a lack of Government funding”. The student contribution charge of €3,000 a year was “one of the highest in Europe” and should be abolished, she said. “High fees coupled with the cost of rent means students are literally being priced out of education or they are commuting several hours a day or having to defer a year to work and save up,” she said. Other students had to couch surf or pay exorbitant rents due to a lack of affordable accommodation around the country. Ms Austick said the Government needed to ‘significantly invest in a way that’s sustainable and effective so that regardless of a student’s background they can avail of education.”Cost was “the biggest barrier to education” in Ireland and many young people “don’t even consider college because they know how much it will cost.The SUSI grant “isn’t enough and doesn’t reflect the cost of living,” she said. Instead, students were left “worrying where they’re going to get money for their next month’s rent or their next meal.” The accommodation crisis had “worsened year on year” which exacerbated existing cost related issues. This was due to the high cost of rent, student accommodation providers turning into “short term tourist lettings,” and many landlords who “would have opened up rooms for digs before but didn’t want to do that this year because of Covid”. The Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris “continued to announce new college places for courses but if it is not accompanied by living spaces that are affordable, students can’t actually get to college in the first place,” Ms Austick said. Another student who attended the protest, Shay Galon, told the  she was there to “support friends who have to commute ages to get to college”. Ms Galon, who studies journalism at TUD said while her friends get two or three buses to college each day, she remained living at home in Firhouse and “would probably be left living there until I’m about 47 at this stage” due to the high cost of renting in the city. “Things are so unstable for students. It’s scary,” she said. The protest was the second of three planned protests this week. On Monday, students protested outside the Grand Parade Library in Cork city, while a third and final protest is planned for Wednesday afternoon at the Spanish Arch in Galway city."},{"url":null,"title":"our students are less resourceful than ever what s going on","story":"We create certain expectations in our students when we adjust what is required of them. Those same expectations cannot be met forever. Illustration: iStock‘The ability to find quick and clever ways to overcome difficulties.” “Being able to deal creatively and effectively with problems.” “The quality of being good at finding ways of solving problems.” These are just some of the ways of defining the “something” our students are lacking: resourcefulness. After three decades of teaching I find students are less resourceful now than they have ever been. Covid’s role in this is limited, so let’s park that chestnut and look at the bigger – and more worrying – picture, the picture that both predates Covid and will also long outlive it.How we provide for students with special educational needs sends a message to all our students. They can be hawk-eyed when it suits them and they absorb every detail of how work is set, distributed, differentiated and adapted. They acquire ways of responding to the challenges they meet. Just the thing for students on the lookout for opportunities to offload work they find onerous.At their age, being fully informed of all the details is irrelevant – what they see is that Billy or Bob gets an “easier” option, and they simply want that too. As adults,\u0026nbspit is our job to ensure that all adjustments and accommodations are granted in accordance with the guidelines, and that each student is offered their own best shot at optimal learning and maximum achievement.Across the board in Irish education, policies are very clear on our responsibility as teachers to provide for and accommodate all of the students in our care, whatever their particular needs.Nothing less would make sense, and yet once class size, teacher to pupil ratio and the number of teaching hours per week are factored in, we must question how effectively any teacher can deliver this for every single student.The goals and targets set for those with special educational needs will of course be adapted, and appropriately qualified additional teachers will be allocated time with those students. This in itself creates extra demands on teachers. Communication between the mainstream and special education teachers requires time, which is a good deal harder to come by in our profession than anyone outside it realises.What if the increased demand on adults as a result of resource provision means the student is ultimately less rather than more resourceful? What if we risk conveying the message that we can outsource our challenges?With this in mind what we communicate to our students – all of them – about how to respond to challenges urgently needs reassessing. Current policies lack emphasis on the student’s own role and responsibility towards learning.Parental guidance and support is crucial to youngsters, and provision needs to be made in policies for how parents can consciously engage in dialogue with their children about learning.Much of this work involves students recognising when they are working at their peak so that they can develop a hunger for it. Experiencing the delight that comes with rewards and success is what helps them along the way. This is how we allow them the time and space required to navigate their own path to a very particular sweet spot in the learning experience: the feeling of real achievement. The kind that involves bumps in the road and a need to overcome obstacles. Exactly the kind of experience which I believe many students are denied. It is all too easy for them to get off to a poor start in a subject and then write it off forever. Appropriately scaffolded work combined with the right doses of motivation works wonders and can lead a student down a very different road. Making it about what they already know and have already accomplished is vital. If we only focus on the gaps we nourish self-doubt, and the student’s inner self-saboteur soon takes centre stage. And with that their capacity to be resourceful dwindles rapidly.A student who gets the message that they need to be relieved of a particular learning burden will inevitably relax the corresponding learning muscle. Right now, based on what our current system values, decisions are taken to avoid unnecessarily overloading or discouraging the student.When we value academic performance above and beyond all else, we have no choice but to protect a student from inevitable failure. Essentially, that is what we do when we lower the bar and make allowances. I’m not against this in principle, but what concerns me is that those allowances will not necessarily be made throughout their lives.We create certain expectations in our students when we adjust what is required of them. Those same expectations cannot be met forever, and for that reason I would argue that we would better serve our students by making fewer allowances, especially in the early years. Let’s think bigger and outside the box, and place the emphasis in such a way that pupils experience learning without pressure for longer. We could leave them free to develop a broader range of learning muscles before putting any of them to the test. We could monitor more, and report less.Young people imitate what they see. They model their behaviour on that of others. What we make possible for them and what we ourselves do are both influential here. We who are in roles that youngsters observe need to ensure that they recognise challenges as the massive opportunities they so often are. It is important to convey the language of motivation and excitement rather than discouragement and anxiety. This is what leads young people towards finding new ways and being creative. They get to exercise their problem-solving muscle and learn as they go.Resourcefulness is most definitely an inside job, so let’s not encourage our students to outsource it."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hse audit highlights major flaws in recruitment of junior doctors","story":"According to the auditors, University Hospital Limerick, the Mater hospital in Dublin and Cork University Hospital do not have in place Garda vetting for NCHDs. Photograph: iStockMajor flaws in the recruitment of junior doctors have been highlighted in a series of HSE internal audit reports.One-quarter of all NCHDs had not fully completed all their occupational health assessments, according to one report, and recruitment procedures are not fully up to date.A requirement for the hiring consultant to directly obtain a verbal reference for NCHDs recruited abroad was not being adhered to, auditors also found. And because employment record reports are not being reviewed, potential non-compliance issues are not being identified and addressed.Just one-fifth of applications sampled had the required two references on file, the auditors found.Other, systemic issues emerged from audit fieldwork in six hospitals – interview notes not being detailed, required references not being on file, candidates not being required to provide identification at interview stage and the holding of telephone rather than video interviews.The level of assurance in relation to the recruitment of NCHDs is unsatisfactory, the report concluded.The audit focused on non-formal training posts, often lasting six or 12 months, not recognised for training and filled by international medical graduates. Many of these have not worked in Ireland before.In 201819, there were 2,500 non-training NCHDs, compared with 4,000 in training to be consultants.According to the auditors, University Hospital Limerick, the Mater hospital in Dublin and Cork University Hospital do not have in place Garda vetting for NCHDs, or a structure interview process in line with guidelines. These hospitals, along with Cavan General Hospital and University Hospital Galway, fail to obtain oral references before employing candidates.The largest hospital in the country, St James’s in Dublin, does not carry out international police checks for an NCHD recruited outside the State, according to a report. Two references were not on file for 40 per cent of cases tested and the hospital does not require candidates to provide identification when they are being interviewed.In the RCSI hospital group, two of four staff employed were not put on the minimum point of the pay scale, in breach of Government policy. Interview panels were not chaired by a person independent of the hospital group, and interview notes were not available for two of the files reviewed. Probation periods were set at six months rather than the 12 months required nationally.In Cork University Hospital, Garda vetting was not on file for 40 per cent of the files reviewed and candidates were not required to provide identification at interview stage. For 20 per cent of NCHDs tested there was no record of completing the required English language tests.The Mater hospital did not have two references on file for almost 60 per cent of cases tested management said it had been requested on numerous occasions.Meanwhile, in University Hospital Limerick, 15 out of 20 NCHDs reported working more than 48 hours a week, despite the European Working Time Directive which limits the working week to that period.

It is understood Dr Tony Holohan told opposition health spokespersons that the National Public Health Emergency Team is unlikely to recommend further measures following its meeting this week. It comes as the Department of Health has reported 3,666 new Covid cases. There were 638 Covid patients in hospital down 46 from yesterday, of whom 130 are in ICU, an increase of four. Sources at the meeting said the CMO said he is not expecting to recommend additional restrictions following its meeting on Thursday. Instead the focus will be on evaluating the existing measures. Dr Holohan told the group while he is hopeful, there can be no guarantees given the current trajectory of the disease.It is understood he said it was very likely that a further extension of the booster jabs will be recommended. He also said antigen testing has a role to play. And expressed optimism about new anti-viral medications which are showing strong results with up to 50 per cent reduction in hospitalisations. However they’re unlikely to be available for use here until the end of January next year.In a statement on Tuesday evening, Dr Holohan said:“We know that the level of worry has increased to levels last seen in April this year. “We know what we are asking people to do to help supress the spread of disease in our communities is very difficult. If we all make a concerted effort it can make a difference.“Our research tells us that people are listening to the public health advice and are reducing the number of people they are planning to meet, and are cancelling social events, to reduce their contacts.”He urged those with cold or flu symptoms to isolate an get a PCR test, he asked people to prioritise who they met and to meet outdoors or with windows open indoors. He also urged people to wear a mask properly and to “use the right test and understand what the test results mean”. Separately the HSE confirmed that dozens of people had been mistakenly called for vaccine boosters at the Fairyhouse facility in Co Meath on Monday. A spokeswoman said 41 people aged under 60 were incorrectly scheduled. “The vaccination centre is currently reviewing their scheduling process to ensure this does not happen again. The HSE apologies for any inconvenience caused.”Mandatory vaccinesOn Tuesday night Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, warned that countries need to be careful around the concept of mandatory Covid vaccines. “You have to be in a position where you have tried everything else and you are not making progress where the potential public health and health impact in terms of deaths is so high that you have no other choice,” he said.“If that is introduced it should be for the shortest possible period of time and with due regard for human rights.” Speaking on RTE’s Prime Time on Tuesday, he said further lockdown measures should be a last resort but noted that in Ireland public interaction had reverted to old ways. “The reality is that mobility in Ireland and social mixing is at pre-pandemic levels. We are mixing together in a winter environment while the virus is still here. And the fact remains that this virus is not done with us even though we’d like to be done with it,” he said. Waiting listsMeanwhle the HSE’s chief operations officer has warned that cancelled procedures and a policy of not scheduling appointments because of Covid-19 will mean that waiting lists will get longer.Anne O’Connor said procedures were not being scheduled, but the situation had not yet reached the point where all non-Covid procedures were being cancelled, as has had happened during the worst phase of the pandemic.There are currently 638 people being treated in hospital with Covid-19, 130 in ICU, of whom 78 are invasively ventilated, said Ms O’Connor.Hospital directors would review their situations day by day, Ms O’Connor said. They would continue to do that and make decisions based on what their inidual hospital could manage and if necessary to moderate their activity.RestrictionsEarlier, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan played down the prospect of an early return to Covid-19 restrictions, saying he wants to see the impact of people restricting their socialising before further decisions are made. The Minister for the Environment referred to last week’s Government decision to bring in a midnight curfew for restaurants, pubs and nightclubs and said people were also taking their own initiative to rein in their socialising. His comments came as it emerged this morning that plans for a subsidised antigen test regime were not expected to be ready in time for today’s Cabinet meeting. Ministers are discussing the ongoing rise of Covid-19 cases at that meeting.Speaking to reporters on the way into Cabinet Mr Ryan said: “I think a lot of people have reacted to the decisions last week, a lot of people have cancelled events, have held back, and I think that was the signal to the country that a lot of people have taken up. We are reducing our socialisation, reducing our contacts.“I think we said at the time – and I think it’s good medical science – wait three weeks to see what exactly is the consequence of that.”In remarks reported by RTÉ, Mr Ryan said: “It is quite a significant change that occurred last week, around the country, everyone knows it. “Right across the board, people are rightly restricting their movements so I’d prefer to wait and see the consequences of that and then we’ll make further decisions.”Anitgen testsMr Ryan also referred to the delay in Cabinet considering a plan for subsidising antigen tests saying more time was needed “to get it right”. He said it appeared that people were not using them correctly, so it was important to get the correct information to people on how and when to use them. Despite expectations since last week that a plan for providing antigen tests to the public at subsidised cost of around €3, no proposal has yet been brought to the Cabinet by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. The initial proposal was to start with pharmacies, before other retailers, who would be able to give advice on when to use rapid tests.However, consideration is still being given to how other parts of the retail sector could participate in the scheme. A late offer from retailers on how they might come on board may be among the reasons for the delay.Opposition TDs have criticised the delay and called for antigen tests to be free.Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane said it’s “incredible” that a year after an expert panel was set up that there still is no “coherent plan” for the use of antigen tests.He claimed there was a “lack of urgency” from Government.

The comments of Louise Haigh not only contradict these but demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the principle of consent,” she said.Ms Haigh’s comments reflect Labour’s position since Tony Blair became leader and the party abandoned its policy of supporting Irish unity by consent.

Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinBuyin’ or sellin’?Anyone buyin’ or sellin’ a PCR test? It was easier on Tuesday to get your hands on tickets for Garth Brooks than it was to get your nostrils around a Covid cotton bud. (And tickets for the Croker cowboy don’t go on sale until Thursday.) Half the country seemed to be on the hunt for a prized Golden Swab but precious few were in circulation – unlike the virus. In the Dáil, TDs had stories of desperate people hitting up the HSE portal in the dead of night trying to score some nice young man or woman to lob the swab on them as soon as possible. “You can’t get a PCR test for love nor money in Dublin,” wailed Richard Boyd Barrett, appealing to the Taoiseach to set up walk-in testing facilities as a matter of urgency.As for Mary Lou McDonald, she’s had it up to here with the Government. But that’s nothing new for Leaders’ Questions.However, her concern about the worrying pressure on ICU capacity amid mounting Covid numbers and rising public worry about the imposition of further restrictions will have found a receptive audience beyond Leinster House. If that isn’t bad enough, “people’s inability to access testing is really, as they say, putting the tin hat on things,” she told the Taoiseach. And just in case Micheál Martin hadn’t realised: “We are only weeks away from Christmas.”As if the nation isn’t frightened enough. ‘Dithering’The Opposition’s Covid theme centred on what they insist is the Government’s lack of planning for the fourth wave. Or “dithering”, as Mary Lou prefers to call it. Labour’s Duncan Smith, standing in for party leader Alan Kelly (medical appointment), also brought up ICU capacity and the dearth of PCR tests. Along with other members of the Opposition, he said he called last year for PCR facilities to be beefed up. If the Government had listened to them at the time, “we wouldn’t be scrambling for private capacity to be used to try to meet the demand.”Despite the “unbelievable amount” of tests carried out by the HSE in the last week, supply is still not meeting demand, he told the Dáil. “If you logged on right now, lunchtime, in this country you would not be able to get a test or you’ll have to stay up late, ’til 12 o’clock at night refreshing screens to try and get a cancellation test. It’s just not good enough.”Although if Duncan looks on the bright side all this constant checking and disappointment should prove a great learning curve for the older ranks of the 10-gallon hat brigade when Garth’s tickets are released. He agreed with Mary Lou on the mood of the country right now. Judging from the feedback he’s been getting the populace is “really, really upset out there and they are expecting restrictions coming down the line. So your Government are going to have to get straight with people.”It’s all about planning, he told the Taoiseach, same as it was at the start of this pandemic two years ago and same as it is now.Long-term plans“You are going to have to make long-term plans and stop operating as if this wave is going to be our last,” said deputy Smith, advising the Government to operate as is if the virus is going to be around for the foreseeable future and to plan accordingly. “We have planned and we are planning accordingly,” the Taoiseach tersely told him, with more than a hint of “don’t teach your Cork granny how to suck eggs” in his tone. Marian Harkin of the Independent Group also joined the disapproving chorus with a fresh twist on how the Government should have seen things coming sooner and acted more quickly. It’s neither today nor yesterday when schools began having difficulty hiring substitute teachers, but the advent of Covid has made a bad situation far worse. Why weren’t measures put in place when the pandemic first began to bite? The TD for Sligo said so many primary school teachers are out sick or self-isolating that many schools are finding it impossible to find temporary replacements. “This is a crisis,” she told the Taoiseach. “It’s worse now than it was before.” Duncan Smith mentioned how the need for more PCR test facilities was raised last year. Marian Harkin said she alerted the Minister for Education last year about the substitute problem coming down the tracks. By coincidence, at the same time Marian was telling the Dáil how bad things have become, Norma Foley was about to meet representatives from the teacher training colleges to discuss how to address the problem. “But Taoiseach,” sighed deputy Harkin, “this should have happened this time last year. This is bad management and I hate to say that, but I think this needs to be called out for what it is.” Micheál conceded that something must be done now “given the once-in-a-century nature of a global pandemic”. Measures will have to be taken “which you would not take in ordinary peacetime, I put it that way to you”. ‘Flexible’All this will be examined, promised former múinteoir Micheál, but teachers will have to be “flexible” and adopt a less “rigid, bureaucratic” approach. Those words will have gone down a treat with the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO).“Yes, this is a once-in-a-century emergency situation and I believe that insufficient planning has gone into dealing with it,” concluded Marian.But Norma was on the ball, as turned out. On Tuesday night she announced a raft of emergency measures to boost substitute cover during the Covid staffing crisis. This move was welcomed by the INTO in a flexible, non-rigid manner. Meanwhile, the Taoiseach continued on his lonely quest for a little bit of appreciation from the Opposition for what his Government and the HSE has achieved along our two-year pandemic path.Ireland’s performance so far “on the key metric of mortality and in terms of protecting life and severe illness, stands up to most countries across Europe and the globe”, he declared. “That should be acknowledged.”But listening to the Opposition talk about PCR tests would give you the impression that “nobody is getting tested and no one can be tested”, even though 207,000 people were processed in the last seven days. He recalled Mary Lou saying last year that 100,000 tests a week would be “the holy grail”.“It’s all very well to talk about putting the tin hat on it and absolutely attempting to ridicule what’s going on but that’s not right either, deputy McDonald,” chided Micheál.“I just don’t think it’s right,” he murmured disconsolately. Maybe so, but unfortunately the Taoiseach has a better chance of catching Covid than he has of catching a break from that particular quarter."},{"url":null,"title":"return of major restrictions would trigger reopening of pup varadkar","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said there were idications the positivity rate of Covid-19 tests and the number of new infections was “starting to level off,” but it was too early to say for sure. Photograph: Cyril ByrneAny reintroduction of severe Covid-19 restrictions would “trigger” a review of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) scheme, which would likely have to be reopened for people laid off, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said. The Government would seek to “avoid imposing extreme restrictions if we can” over the coming weeks, the Fine Gael leader said. Mr Varadkar said a memo on plans to subsidise the price of antigen tests down to €2-€3 per test could be ready to go to Cabinet towards the end of this week.“We’re working with the pharmacies and also the supermarkets and retailers on that. We could have a memo by the end of the week, it could be next Tuesday, but I think it will be this week or next,” he said. Speaking on Tuesday evening, Mr Varadkar said there were some indications the positivity rate of Covid-19 tests and the number of new infections was “starting to level off,” but it was too early to say for sure. The increasing number of people in intensive care units remained the “real pinch point” at present, with politicians and health officials “very concerned” about the situation, he said. The Government would have to consider reopening the PUP scheme and review the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, in a situation where the country returned to strict restrictions, he said. “We don’t have any plans at the moment to make any changes to the Wage Subsidy Scheme or the Pandemic Unemployment Payment,” Mr Varadkar said. “Things would only change if we were in a position where we had to reimpose further restrictions. Say for example if we had to bring in capacity limits or say to certain industries that they had to close,” he said. “We couldn’t say to people, many of whom would be being laid off for the second or third time, that all of a sudden you don’t need income support, you’d have to respond to that and we will,” he said. Mr Varadkar said the country was “not at that point by any means at the moment,” but any move back to major restrictions would be “the trigger point” where Covid supports were reviewed. “I don’t want to create the impression we’re planning to reimpose severe restrictions over the next couple of weeks, because we’re not, but nor can we rule it out,” he said. Mr Varadkar also said the future definition of who was deemed fully vaccinated may change from those with two doses to three doses. “The evidence from Israel and America and other places is starting to indicate fully vaccinated is three doses rather than two,” he said. The Government would continue to “review” the emerging evidence, and any changes to Covid cert requirements would only follow everyone being offered booster shots, he said. “People don’t need to be worried that they’re going to wake up one morning and hear on the news that all of a sudden their Covid pass doesn’t work as they’ve only had two doses,” he said. It was likely to be “well into the New Year” before “we have everybody covered that we want covered” with booster vaccines, he said. Mr Varadkar was speaking to reporters at the opening of a new exhibition on the Anglo Irish Treaty in the National Museum of Ireland, in collaboration with the Hugh Lane Gallery.

move to the Middle East.The British Army Training Unit Suffield (Batus) in Alberta, western Canada, has been in operation since 1972, training thousands of British soldiers in live firing exercises. More than 1,000 vehicles, including tanks and helicopters, are regularly used by regiments for weeks at a time at the 2,700 kilometre-square base, seven times the size of Salisbury Plain.However, Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, is expected to announce later this week that plans to modernise the Army will include developing a training area in Oman.The move to use the Omani desert, near Duqm airbase and port, as the main training ground for tanks and other armoured vehicles will mean the Batus camp, home to more than 400 permanent British staff, and the smaller Wainwright training area nearby, will close.Defence sources said the shift to the Gulf would enable British forces to position hardware closer and more visibly to partner nations, such as Ukraine and Bahrain, and potential adversaries, such as Iran.This would reduce the time necessary to respond to any crisis in the region and allow the Government to showcase British military technology to boost potential arms sales.A defence source close to the plans told The : “If you only have 148 tanks and 22 of them are stuck in Canada, that’s 22 tanks that are not at readiness and not available to do anything operational.“If they are training in Poland or Duqm, the logic is that they are having a more operational and deterrent effect.”An MoD spokesman said Batus would not close before 2023, as big tank exercises were already planned over the next two years.Beyond that, small numbers of military personnel would still be located in Canada, as defence attaches, liaison officers and on exchange with Canadian units.  The announcement is set to form part of a broader plan outlining how the Army will adapt to take advantage of digital technology while still maintaining forces available to Nato for battlefield scenarios.Soldiers have been told to expect an announcement imminently about new structures and unit roles.The announcement will include an update on the Ranger Regiment, detailing which units will form the new force and the selection and training courses required to join.The Rangers were announced in March, and will be formed from four existing battalions before recruiting more widely from the Army. Ben Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the new Rangers would be described as a special operations brigade and modelled on the US Green Berets.As with their US counterparts, Mr Barry said the British troops could “work with resistance forces”, for example operating for months alongside Syrian or Afghan fighters against terrorist groups.They will be supported by a security force assistance brigade, another new formation to be made up of existing units and designed to train and advise partner forces, but not be as exposed to as much potential harm as the Special Operations brigade.However, Mr Barry said there was a risk in shrinking the Army and making it more specialised at the same time.“If this Special Operations brigade becomes another elite organisation requiring people to compete to be selected into it like Airborne Forces and the Army component of 3 Commando Brigade, this becomes yet another elite force which, by definition, will compete against the other elite forces for highly motivated, self-starting people in an Army that’s getting smaller. “There’s a danger it will be difficult to find the people it needs, and if it does find the people it needs it will suck out of the conventional units the self-motivated people that are so important to keeping the unit going.”The Army plans to reorganise to enable it to fight a major war, after decades in which it became specialised in fighting insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 forced defence chiefs to refocus on building a “heavy metal” warfighting ision of tanks and armoured vehicles.British forces are stationed in Poland as part of Nato’s mission to deter Russia, and training with tanks already takes place there.The announcement of the move of the training base to Oman comes amid increasing tensions with the Kremlin as a result of the migrant crisis on the Polish border with Belarus.   More from NewsTwo

better immune response current","story":"A new vaccine designed to specifically create T-cells against Covid produces a better immune response than the alternatives already in use, according to trial data.The CoVac-1 jab has been developed and made by academics at the University of Tubingen, in Germany.The cells form part of the immune response to protect people against infections and often work in tandem with antibodies. However, while antibody levels often decline over time and need boosting, T-cells have the ability to stay in the bloodstream for several years.Evidence is emerging that T-cell levels from vaccines may be key in conferring long-term protection against Covid, but studying the level of them in a person\u0027s system is difficult.The induction of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity is a central goal for vaccine development and of particular importance for patients with congenital or acquired B-cell deficiencies, the researchers wrote in a paper published in Nature. The latter comprise cancer patients with disease or treatment-related immunoglobulin deficiency.Phase one trial data from 36 people who received the experimental jab early this year showed the vaccine to be safe and capable of producing a robust immune response.The scientists said the vaccine\u0027s T-cell response surpassed those detected after SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as after vaccination with approved vaccines.Data suggest that the vaccine, a single shot in the stomach, produces 3.5 times as many T-cells as the PfizerBioNTech jab and 20 times as many as the AstraZeneca vaccine. Furthermore, vaccine-induced T-cell responses were unaffected by current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, the scientists said.Although the study is small, the results are promising because nobody in the trial tested positive for Covid in the three months following their T-cell jab. The team suggested the vaccine would make for an effective complementary vaccine, particularly for the elderly and immunocompromised, alongside the currently approved jabs.T-cells are becoming of increasing interest to vaccine makers and clinicians as a way to further protect people against disease.The antibody response is what drives the immediate reaction or defence of the body when you\u0027re attacked by the virus and the T-cell response takes a little longer to come in but it\u0027s actually more durable, it lasts longer and the body remembers that longer, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said on Tuesday.T-cells do matter, in particular as it relates to the durability of the response, especially in older people.More from NewsTwo men arrested after body found in hunt for missing teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeodAstraZeneca vaccine may give longer protection that is shielding UK from new Covid waveJeffrey Epstein told prison psychologist he had \u0026#39no interest\u0026#39 in taking his own lifeLetters of no confidence in Boris Johnson have been submitted, claim Tory MPsOnce a prime minister’s authority goes, the end can be swift and brutalAll bark and bite, Nadine Dorries gives the Left as good a verbal thrashing as she getsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"helena bonham carter star new drama exposing truth sacking crossroads","story":"When Noele Gordon was sacked from Crossroads, it was the end of the line for one of soapland’s biggest stars.Her departure in 1981 was such a shock to viewers that it made the major news bulletins, and Gordon never got over the feeling of betrayal. She did not act in another television show, and died four years later.Now her legacy is to be revived in an ITV drama. Helena Bonham Carter is to play Gordon in Nolly, a three-part series written by Russell T Davies and billed as a “heartbreaking portrait of a forgotten icon”.Bonham Carter said she wanted to restore Gordon to her rightful place in the pantheon of television greats.“Noele Gordon was a fascinating, complex, brilliant and gutsy woman - none of which I knew before I read Russell T Davies’s script.“I’m so thrilled to help tell Nolly’s long overdue and largely forgotten story. Russell’s screenplay is a work of brilliance and I hope I’ll do him and Nolly justice,” she said.Gordon played Crossroads Motel owner Meg Richardson, later Meg Mortimer, standing firm for 18 years amid the soap’s famously wobbly sets.Out of the blue, in 1981, she was informed by bosses at ATV that she was to be written out. Gordon went to the press, saying she wept all night after an executive disposed of her in tones so emotionless it was “as though he was reading a weather report”.She appealed directly to Lord Grade, head of ATV, but he refused to intervene. “It is not I who have left Crossroads. It is Crossroads which has left me,” she told a newspaper.The three-part drama promises to reveal “the truth, the consequences, and the legacy of that terrible day”.Her sacking made the News at Ten, and was memorably sent up by Julie Walters on the Victoria Wood show.ATV’s switchboard was swamped with complaints and crowds gathered outside the studio to protest. In the end, Gordon’s character was not killed off but sailed away on the QE2.Gordon went on to appear in the theatre, including a lead role in a West End production of Gypsy. She was persuaded to return to Crossroads in 1983 for two guest appearances. She died of stomach cancer in 1985, aged 65.Davies, whose credits include It’s A Sin and A Very English Scandal, said he had wanted to write about Gordon - “Nolly” to her friends - for decades.He explained: “One of my very first jobs in TV was a trial script for Crossroads, and I’ve wanted to write the story of behind the scenes on that show for 40 years. At last, the truth can be told.”At the time, there were rumours that Central Independent Television, which was taking over the franchise for the Midlands, wanted to kill off Crossroads in favour of more sophisticated programming. Sacking Gordon, it was said, would cause ratings to plummet and the show to be canned.But Nolly will also explore the idea that Gordon’s a ways - she would arrive at rehearsals in a Rolls-Royce - and strong personality set executives against her.ITV said: “Nolly is a bold exploration of how the establishment turns on women who refuse to play by the rules, the women it cannot understand and the women it fears. It is a love letter to a legend of television.”The drama will also reflect the comic aspects of Crossroads, a show renowned for its terrible production values.In her autobiography, Gordon recalled two occasions on which props caught fire but the cameras continued to roll. “We all swung into action, still acting the scene and saying the lines we were supposed to say as we coped with the flaming toaster,” she recalled.More from NewsTwo men arrested after body found in hunt for missing teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeodAstraZeneca vaccine may give longer protection that is shielding UK from new Covid waveJeffrey Epstein told prison psychologist he had \u0026#39no interest\u0026#39 in taking his own lifeLetters of no confidence in Boris Johnson have been submitted, claim Tory MPsOnce a prime minister’s authority goes, the end can be swift and brutalAll bark and bite, Nadine Dorries gives the Left as good a verbal thrashing as she getsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prime ministers authority goes end can swift brutal","story":"There is an old Whitehall story, probably apocryphal, concerning a minister not especially well liked by his officials delivering an important policy speech to some august body. Not long into his oration he turned over a sheet of paper on which was written: “You’re on your own now matey.” The remainder of what he imagined would be a 20-minute speech was blank.Watching Boris Johnson’s address to the CBI on Monday, I wondered if the same prank had been played on him as he rummaged through the pages looking for something, anything, to latch onto. Brilliantly he remembered he’d been to Peppa Pig World with his family at the weekend so he could talk about that. Not only was this an unlikely British success story arising from what seemed to be a fairly nondescript idea, but the peaceful, litter-free society dependent on mass transit was an appealing example for children to follow.It was vintage Boris, the juxtaposition of the colloquial alongside the consequential to make a serious point. It was a technique he had honed over many years as a newspaper columnist and after dinner speaker. Once upon a time, it would have had his audience in stitches.Yet it bombed, triggering another round of “what’s wrong with Boris?” head-shaking in the party and “we told you so” sniggering from his detractors. Not that it troubled the PM. That same evening he spoke at a dinner hosted by the Centre for Policy Studies, in partnership with the , and was off, unapologetically, on his Peppa Pig riff once more.His fascination with this anthropomorphic porker owes everything to the fact that he is the father of a young child, otherwise it would hardly feature in his life. But he would have used some other demotic allusion, maybe from his childhood, like Ivor the Engine to talk about HS2 or Captain Pugwash to extol the importance of Global Britain.This is what Boris is and how he speaks. It is one reason why he has attracted such a large following in the country because he uses the language most people understand, not the ponderous, formulaic cant we are usually fed. But there comes a point when the public perception switches. It can do so almost overnight and then, afterwards, what were perceived as strengths, or at least accepted as endearing eccentricities, become the stick with which you are beaten, mercilessly.So it was with Theresa May whose seriousness, stoicism, and stubbornness were considered just what was needed in the circumstances of the post-referendum crisis only to be seen later as fatal flaws that almost crashed the constitution. So it was with Gordon Brown, whose brooding solemnity was to begin with regarded as the antidote to Blairism before being recognised more widely as a character defect that those inside New Labour had identified years earlier.John Major was less a victim of his personality traits than of circumstances, harried relentlessly by Eurosceptics for refusing a referendum over the Maastricht Treaty until in the end he resigned the Tory leadership, throwing down a gauntlet that only John Redwood picked up. But Major was weaker than Johnson in parliamentary terms. His majority had gone by 1996 and Labour under Blair was sometimes 25 points ahead in the polls. Even if the PM’s personal ratings have subsided recently, Labour has yet to open a significant and consistent poll lead.Mr Johnson’s difficulty, of course, arises when that changes. His biggest political problem is not a predisposition to make references to a porcine cartoon or the shambolic goings-on inside No 10 but reneging on hitherto unambiguous pledges. Whether or not the U-turns on tax, HS2, social care, Owen Paterson, the Northern Ireland Protocol, freeports and the rest were the right things to do, they were not what he said he would do and voters (and MPs) dislike broken promises more than anything else.Mr Johnson has been sustained for two years by the fact that he delivered Brexit as promised and was seen, by and large, to have handled the pandemic as well as anyone could faced with the same circumstances. This afforded him the latitude to be himself. But there comes a point where his once full tank of goodwill is left to run on fumes alone and we may well have reached it.He is as aware of his political mortality as anyone. A few weeks ago while attending the G20 summit in Rome, he recounted to fellow heads of government his memories of another visit to the city 31 years earlier. On the exact same day, October 29, Margaret Thatcher was ambushed at a European Council in the Italian capital by her fellow Europeans determined to press ahead with monetary union. I was in Rome that weekend covering the meeting as this newspaper’s political correspondent in tandem with our Brussels-based reporter, one Boris Johnson.The outcome had a profound impact on his already jaundiced view of the European project, now irredeemably on course to introduce the euro and lay the foundations for the EU. It also set in train a series of tumultuous events that brought about Mrs T’s downfall. She returned to London to denounce the Rome decision and within a month she was gone, toppled by her own party – not because of her views on Europe, even if they triggered the leadership challenge, but because her MPs no longer saw her as a winner. They had just lost the Eastbourne by-election, watching in horror as a 16,000 majority was overturned.Once the ground begins to move beneath the leader’s feet it is hard to stop it becoming an earthquake. Someone in Downing Street has even taken to briefing the BBC that “it’s not working under Boris” while, on the backbenches, emboldened MPs walk through the ision lobbies in opposition to their own Government with almost daily regularity.When the writing is on the wall, the Conservative Party can be ruthless. It is an unsentimental vehicle for holding on to power. If its MPs can throw out their most successful post-war leader, who had a Commons majority of 102 and was regarded at the time as the world’s towering democratic figure, they can get rid of anyone. The end, when it comes, will be swift and brutal.More from NewsTwo men arrested after body found in hunt for missing teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeodAstraZeneca vaccine may give longer protection that is shielding UK from new Covid waveJeffrey Epstein told prison psychologist he had \u0026#39no interest\u0026#39 in taking his own lifeLetters of no confidence in Boris Johnson have been submitted, claim Tory MPsAll bark and bite, Nadine Dorries gives the Left as good a verbal thrashing as she getsBritish Army to leave Canada after 50 years for new base in Middle EastMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"senior politicians fresh faced mps music man project say farewell","story":"Sir David Amess often joked that he had two masters: the Tory party and the Catholic church.As a self-confessed “pro lifer” and unashamed Thatcherite, the Southend West MP’s memorial service at Westminster Cathedral was always going to be a small and big “c” conservative affair.The full requiem mass, complete with a message from the Pope, a reading by a Republican US senator and an eulogy by Ann Widdecombe, could not fail to strike a traditionalist note. Yet like Sir David himself - an anti-abortionist who campaigned for women suffering from endometriosis - Tuesday’s stirring, hour-long ceremony was as multi-layered as celebrant Cardinal Vincent Nichols’ colourful robes punctuating the sea of black-clad mourners. While the pews were largely filled with Sir David’s Conservative colleagues, led from the front by the Prime Minister and his predecessors Theresa May, Sir John Major and David Cameron, the congregation reflected the ersity of the late MP’s beloved Essex constituency.There were elderly statesmen and fresh-faced MPs from the 2019 intake Tory “blue rinsers” sitting alongside glamorous blondes in vertiginous high heels women in hijabs and men in turbans.Reflecting Sir David’s renowned courteousness to the opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, warmly greeted Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, as he made his way to his seat alongside the SNP’s Ian Blackford, who had earlier chatted animatedly with Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary. Mr Blackford got to his seat to find Jacob Rees-Mogg, the devout leader of the House of Commons, kneeling in silent prayer. Former Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both sent their apologies. Before he died in such tragic circumstances on October 15, Sir David had succeeded in getting 200 children and adults with special needs to perform at the Royal Albert Hall. How fitting, then, that his memorial service was opened - not by the imposing sounds of the cathedral organ - but the innocent voices of the Music Man Project. The group, of which Sir David was president, used to meet at the Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea, where he was stabbed to death as he held a constituency surgery.Yet somehow the touching simplicity of their song’s lyrics about “Peace and hopelife and love belief and trustfaith and peace” set the tone for a service that rightly reflected on the highlights of Sir David’s life rather than the horror of his death.The only mention of the parliamentarian’s “murder” came during a heartfelt homily by Canon Pat Browne, who married Sir David and his wife Julia in Westminster Cathedral 38 years ago, and went on to baptise their five children – David, Katherine, Sarah, Alexandra and Florence – as well as recently officiating at the funeral of Sir David’s mother Maud, who lived to 104. As the bright winter sunshine poured through the imposing sanctuary, the softly spoken Irishman described how he had rushed to Sir David’s parliamentary office on “that dreadful afternoon” to find his shocked staff in tears. “They weren’t just his staff, they were his friends,” he said. “Friendship was David’s gift.” He didn’t need to spell out the stark contrast between this committed “collaborator”, whose “first priority was his constituents” - and the isive extremist who took his life.One example of Sir David bridging the political ide was him setting up an All Party Parliamentary Group to foster friendly relations between the UK and the Holy See in 2006 - a move that was clearly appreciated by the Vatican.Archbishop Claudio Gugerotti, the Pope’s representative in the UK, delivered the “heartfelt condolences” of His Holiness, stating: “The Holy Father prays that all who honour his memory will be confirmed in the resolve to reject the ways of violence, to combat evil with good, and to help build a society of ever greater justice, fraternity and solidarity.”There was a lighter moment when it was later revealed that upon meeting Pope Francis’s predecessor, Pope Benedict, Sir David had fumbled in his pocket for his rosary beads only to produce a boiled sweet, “which the Pope graciously blessed instead”. Miss Widdecombe’s eulogy struck a similarly playful note when the former minister, who entered parliament four years after “indefatigable” Sir David in 1987, recalled his “undiminished enthusiasm” for his first seat Balisdon, and then later Southend, succeeding posthumously in winning it the city status he had long (and vocally) campaigned for. Joking about how the animal lover had circumvented the parliamentary authorities by secretly keeping a menagerie of birds and other creatures in his office, she said a testament to Sir David’s unfailing politeness towards - and interest in - others was the spontaneous decision by the doormen and women of the House of Commons to form a guard of honour as part of his funeral procession. “He was the man with the permanent grin,” she added.Yet it was Lady Julia’s words - conveyed by Canon Browne - that left barely a dry eye as he revealed how the Amess family’s faith had helped them through the past five weeks. Quoting Pope John XXIII’s 1999 autobiography, Journal of a Soul, the grieving widow told him: “Death, like birth, is only a transformation ... as natural and easy as going to sleep and waking up.”After members of the Cabinet and congregation took Holy Communion, including Boris Johnson, who was baptised a Catholic and married Carrie Symonds in Westminster Cathedral in May, it was time for the 1,000-strong flock to say their last goodbyes.As the cathedral choristers once again filled the mother church with their high-pitched notes, poignantly chanting the In Paradisum, six pallbearers lifted Sir David’s dark polished oak coffin for its final journey. On Monday, hundreds of people had lined the streets of his constituency to pay their respects following a private service at St Mary’s Church, Prittlewell.The elaborate casket, which had spent the night in the House of Commons crypt, was decorated with a relief depicting the Last Supper. The tragedy of its scriptural significance - a last meal among friends - combined with the hope of the resurrection appeared to sum up the commemoration of a career dedicated to serving others. As Jesus said to his disciples in the gospel according to St John, which was read by Rev Damien Wade, the head of Sir David’s Brentwood diocese: “A man can have no greater love than to lay down his life for his friends.”More from NewsTwo men arrested after body found in hunt for missing teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeodAstraZeneca vaccine may give longer protection that is shielding UK from new Covid waveJeffrey Epstein told prison psychologist he had \u0026#39no interest\u0026#39 in taking his own lifeLetters of no confidence in Boris Johnson have been submitted, claim Tory MPsOnce a prime minister’s authority goes, the end can be swift and brutalAll bark and bite, Nadine Dorries gives the Left as good a verbal thrashing as she getsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"double job tories set rake","story":"Exclusive: Double-job Tories set to rake in £k as Boris Johnson dithers on sleaze crackdownThe Prime Minister has vowed to enact a major crackdown on second jobs after MPs voted for new rules.

Image: REUTERSByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Nov | comments Double-jobbing Tory MPs are set to rake in more than £, while Boris Johnson dithers over a sleaze clampdown.An analysis of parliamentaposs register of interests has shown more than  Conservative MPs are keeping second jobs, while the government delays a clean-up of parliamentary standards. Between now and the end of January, Tory backbenchers are on course to trouser £, of outside cash, in addition to their £, MP salary, with a total of , hoursapos work. And the practice could continue beyond January  as the Prime Minister may yet kick promised reforms into the long grass. Mr Johnson pledged he would enact a major crackdown on second jobs after MPs voted for new rules last week. It will include an outright ban on political consultancy roles and that any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be within reasonable limits and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents.  But as it stands, the Standardsapos Committee is examining ideas and is not due to report to the Government until January. MPs due to take home cash include former minister Sir John Redwood. Between now and the standards committee report, he is poised to earn around £, for his role working  hoursapos a week as committee chair for the private investment firm, Charles Stanley. Another ex-frontbencher Mark Garnier is set to cream in more than £, for three second roles, one of which is listed as aposprinciple speakerapos for BRI Wealth Management. Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is due to earn around £, as aposstrategic adviserapos to Hutchison Ports Europe. And Andrew Mitchell, the former International Development Secretary, is on course to earn himself more than £, from a series of private companies, including Ernst and Young and Kingsley Capital Partners.  It comes after the Toriesapos attempt to rip up the rules and get lobbying MP Owen Paterson off the hook spectacularly backfired and left the PM open to claims of Tory sleaze. The North Shropshire MP, who has since resigned triggering a by-election, was earning more than £, from two private companies and the Standardsapos Commissioner Kathryn Stone had found he made repeated and egregious breaches of lobbying rules. The Conservatives claim that MPs should have a further right to appeal, despite a similar process being available to them via parliamentaposs standards committee. Labour chairwoman Anneliese Dodds told the Mirror: “Conservative MPs with dodgy second jobs face a race against time before Parliament comes forward with plans to end this racket.“Perhaps that explains why so many of them are still raking in the cash from these nice little earners as the deadline approaches. “Given how many hours these MPs are spending on their big money side hustles, constituents will wonderthey ever find any time to do the day job. “It’s time to clean up the cash for access culture Boris Johnson has created at the heart of the British government.

Currently there are no independent analysis as to how many medics are being trained in the pipeline to meet estimated future demand. Patricia Marquis, director of the Royal College of Nursing in England, said: “A broad coalition of professional, political and public support has been overlooked by a Government still unwilling to solve the staffing crisis in the NHS and care system. There is widespread disappointment and disbelief this evening. When vacancy levels are so high, the move is short-sighted at best and wilfully reckless at worst.The amendment had been proposed ex-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and was supported by nearly  of the UK’s most prominent health and care organisations. It would have required the Government to publish independent workforce projections twice a year to ensure the pipeline of clinical staff in training meets future demand. There are around , NHS staffing vacancies advertised in England. The Health Foundation projects an extra , doctors and , nurses will be required to clear the backlog. Nowhere near the amount deeded are thought to be in the training pipeline. Full time equivalent GP numbers are actually falling as more leave or cut their hours than join the workforce. Currently the NHS pays around £billion a year on locums to fill staffing gaps.  Jeremy Hunt, now chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, told MPs: Yes this will cost the NHS money, but it will save the NHS even more money, because every additional nurse or doctor is an additional locum we donapost need to employ. Because locums are more expensive and less good for patients, because t makes it harder for them to see the same doctor. Royal College of Physicians data published last week revealed there has been a % increase in unfilled consultant posts across the UK since . Richard Murray, Chief Executive of The King’s Fund, said: Years of poor planning and short-term thinking has left health and care services struggling to cope with chronic staff shortages. The amendment would have addressed this by encouraging a more strategic, long-term approach based on the regular publication of future workforce projections. Despite pledges, promises and manesto commitments there is still no plan to address workforce shortages, and there is no certainty about the budgets for staff education and training. The health and care workforce crisis continues to be a blind spot for the Government. Patricia Marquis added: “The amendments we backed were designed to ensure health and care services have the workforce they need to deliver safe high-quality services now and in the future. Thousands of nursing staff and supporters contacted their MPs this week, asking them to stand up for safe staffing and back changes to this bill. “The current approach to workforce planning is haphazard and leads to shortages - running counter to all ambitions to improve patient safety. “For the remainder of its time in Parliament, we and others will continue to push for amendments to the bill. The nursing profession will continue to speak out on the need for a sustainable and accountable workforce plan and highlight the impact of the current level of vacancies.” Comment MORE ON NHSHealth Trust Inc.Royal College of NursingJeremy HuntPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is also a very well paid job. MPs get paid £, a year – that’s more than  percent of people in our country. It should be a full-time job, too.But too many MPs just don’t treat it like that - instead they treat it as an opportunity to chase corporate cash through second jobs.When they do that, they are short-changing the public and disrespecting our democracy. We have heard all the fake Tory arguments about how these second jobs give MPs real-world experience.That’s rubbish. The Health Secretary, for example, was getting paid £, an hour earlier this year for a previous role advising a US investment bank. He was getting the same again for a third job too. That’s not the real world lived in by my constituents and tens of millions more. Isn’t it funny how Tory MPs who justy the racket of second jobs never choose to work for low wages in supermarkets, as bus drivers, or in care homes  The truth is that their big money extra jobs do not make Members of Parliament more in touch with the real world. They make them even more out of touch with the people they’re meant to represent. MPs aren’t being paid for what they know – but who they know. They wouldn’t get these vast sums from big corporationsthey weren’t MPs with political connections. Recent events show exactly why we need a ban on second jobs. That’s why I am bringing forward a new parliamentary Bill today. My Bill is clear and bold: no paid second jobs for MPs at all except in some very limited circumstances.  No-one can serve two masters - and for MPs their priority must be their constituents. Of course, second jobs will be allowed where it’s about maintaining their professional qualication like in nursing orthey are working on the frontline in our NHS as doctors or in another emergency service.Those roles are about genuine public service and have nothing to do with the scandal that has been shaking parliament.For my Bill to now be able to become law, the government needs to give it time on the parliamentary agenda. Boris Johnson should do thathe is actually serious about acting against the ever-closer relationship between big business and our politics. Parliament now must show that it understands that the rot in our political system is deep and needs cutting out. It is time to ban second jobs for MPs.

Labour called on the Government to make “better use” of community pharmacies and walk-in and pop-up clinics to make it easier for parents to get their children vaccinated. Kate Green, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said: “Children have been treated as an afterthought throughout this pandemic and continue to be let down by a Conservative Government which has shown no care for them and their futures. “Labour has been urging ministers to make every effort to get the vaccine out to children over , from pop-up and walk-in clinics to bringing back volunteers and retired clinicians.  “This must come alongside finally introducing the ventilation in schools that Sage recommended well over a year ago and giving schools the support they need on masks and other mitigations. “The Conservatives have been complacent, and children are paying the price.

We can reveal that ambulances have been called to the firm’s “ fulfilment centres ” almost , times since , including  callouts to its site in Tilbury, Essex, where a male employee died this month. A whistleblower at Tilbury told the Mirror: “Amazon don’t care about the health of their workers, they treat people like slaves. “For the first three sick days you don’t get paid – it doesn’t matteryou’re dying or you’ve lost a leg. “That policy encourages people to come to work when they are not well because they are scared of not being paid or being fired.  “Picking items is relentless, it’s physically so hard on your body and the productivity targets are stressful. It’s all about money.”Freedom of Information requests to nine NHS ambulance trusts show  callouts were made to  Amazon warehouses between January ,  to August , , which is equal to up to five a week.Paramedics treated people who had lost consciousness, or were suffering from traumatic injuries, breathing problems and chest or cardiac pain. The Tilbury whistleblower claimed that staff were expected to pick up to  items an hour during -hour night shts.  The man added: “You are bending down and reaching up – it sends you mad and kills your knees and back all night.” Another former Tilbury worker said years of manual work for Amazon caused his shoulder to dislocate in .

There were  callouts in the first eight months of this year alone, which represents a % increase on . One callout to Amazon’s centre in Rugby, Warks, was recorded as a suicide attempt, while a “suicidal thoughts” call was made at another depot in Rugeley, Staffs. Someone suffered a drug overdose at Rugeley this year.  After a worker was found dead in the toilets at Tilbury on November , a former employee wrote on the staff Face book: “It was mental when I worked there and literally this doesn’t surprise me at all.

Amazon boss Jeff Bezos makes £.million an hour.Comment, by Ros-Wynne Jones Amazon fulfilment warehouses are gearing up for this week’s Black Friday and a busy Christmas, with a massive ad campaign looking for staff. But once they get behind the high walls of Jeff Bezos’s slick empire, new arrivals may be surprised by working le there. For starters, the trillion-dollar company doesn’t even have a fair sick pay policy. There is no pay for the first three days off sick, unless you have Covid. There were  ambulance callouts to its Tilbury warehouse alone between January ,  and August , . One staff member said working for Amazon was like “slave labour”. A Mirror investigation with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and ITV News found the firm broke its own rules by using agency workers on zero-hour contracts. Some of those workers called it “slave labour” too. Oxford University research found Amazon Flex – the delivery arm of Amazon – offered the joint- worst working conditions for gig economy workers in the UK. Amazon Flex scored zero, meaning that it failed in all categories. Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB Union, which represents some Amazon staff, said: “In terms of pushing the workforce to breaking point and levels of exploitation, Amazon is one of the most concerning.” A spokesman for Amazon said: “Once again, our critics are using incomplete information that’s without context and designed to intentionally mislead. “The fact is that Amazon has % fewer injuries on average compared to other transportation and warehousing businesses in the UK. “The vast majority of ambulance callouts are related to pre-existing conditions, not work-related incidents.” Comment MORE ON Jeff BezosAmazonEmployment rights\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Doctors insist that you should always see your GPyou are worriedSelf-diagnosing online is not helpful, go to your doctor Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByNatasha HoltBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Nov | commentsPeople feeling anxious or nervous should not stop them from going to their GP, say doctors.Research can make us worry about our health as well, and there are often new scientic developments and discoveries that can question our own health despite us feeling completely normal. An uncomfortable twitching around the eyes can be a way to identy a vitamin B deficiency, while sleep patterns can indicate high cholesterol.Symptoms like these and many more can worry people, but people may still feel they do not want to go to the doctor. Going to the doctor can be daunting for some people. Some avoid it out of fear or embarrassment, while others may feel as though their particularly medical ailment may be a burden, some may just ignore the signs of a problem. However, a quick trip online can scare us all due to self-diagnosis, diagnosis that should be done by medically trained professionals So what are the right questions to ask about your health The top questions to ask your doctor ahead of visiting your GP surgeryDoctors are busier than ever and as a patient you can sometimes feel under pressure not to waste their time. That means we often leave the surgery or end an online consultation and only later realise we didn’t ask a crucial question. Additionally, we don’t always remember the things we are told. One research study shows that when patients were asked what they were told six days after their appointment, on average they could only manage to recall three facts. Excellent consultation skills are one of the most important tools of any doctor’s working le, said Dr Deborah Lee from the Dr Fox Online Pharmacy . To meet a patient’s needs involves understanding their ideas, concerns and expectations. That means giving them the time to ask questions, checking their understanding and ensuring they leave with key take-home messages. As doctors we’d always rather you asked anything you are worried about and as a patient it’s best to go into your consultation armed with the right questions to ask. So what are the right questions What can I do to help my condition  Research shows that when a patient is fully engaged with their own healthcare, the outcome is much better. You need to be empowered to make informed decisions to allow you to take appropriate action and make better lestyle choices, explained Dr Lee. It’s important you leave the consultation understanding what you can do to help yourself. Your doctor cannot manage your le for you. This is down to the decisions you make for yourself every day. So knowing the best way to manage a condition increases your chances of staying healthy. If you’re worried you’ll forget key information, take a friend or family member along. Never be embarrassed to write notes as you talk to your GP.What are these tests for As a patient, you must give your consent before any tests or procedures can be carried out for you. Giving consent means you understand what is being proposed, are able to ask any questions you have, and you have agreed to go ahead. You should understand exactly what you are being tested for, especiallythere would be a potentially severe outcomethe test was positive, says Dr Lee. Better communication is also much safer for you, as certain tests require you to do certain things beforehand. Your GP should also explain the instructions for tests, for example,you should fast beforehand oryou need to arrange transport and support at home after a procedure.Are there any alternatives to this treatment  Choice is important because all treatments have an outcome and we never know that outcome until after the event, explains Dr Lee. People dfer very markedly in their views about health and their wishes for treatment, and these must always be respected. A doctor can’t force a patient down a specic pathwaythey prefer an alternative. Remember, you’re also entitled to refuse treatment altogether. So make sure you understand what’s available to you.Should I get a second opinion Donapost be worried about getting a second opinion, it is important to make yourself feel at ease and trust the medical process. This is a perfectly reasonable request, especiallyyou have a serious diagnosis and are trying to decide on treatment, insists Dr Lee. However, sometimes wanting a second opinion may reflect a lack of understanding about your condition, confusion about the proposed treatment, or a lack of confidence in your doctor. If you’re having doubts you can ask your doctor to refer you for a second opinion or arrange to see another doctor at your practice.What should I doit starts to get worse  It is important to understand your condition and know when to call for help. Good examples are asthma or diabetes, says Dr Lee, These can quickly spiral out of control and even be fatal. By understanding how to monitor your disease, the trigger factors and warning signs and when to call for help, tragedies can be avoided. You can also correctly adapt the use of your medication.How do I get my results Patients experience extreme anxiety waiting for results, so you should be told exactly when to expect your test results and how they will be given, insists Dr Lee. Some patients assume ‘no news is good news’ but occasionally results go astray, soyou’re aware you haven’t received them as promised you’ll know when to chase them up.Are there any side effects to medication  Your doctor should tell you about the common side effects, but you should also read the information leaflet inside your medication. This is important because some side effects may be mild and get better quite quickly as your body adjusts to the drug, while some may not. You should know the symptoms and signs of an acute allergic reaction, for example, which is a medical emergency, says Dr Lee. Any unusual or severe side effects should be reported to your doctor immediately.Where can I find out more about my condition You can use the internet to try and give yourself answers, but it is still better to talk to your doctor. Your doctor may even recommend useful websites for you to look at.It’s a far better idea to ask your doctor to recommend good quality websites where you can trust what you read, advises Dr Lee.

Glenlola Collegiate School in Bangor, Northern Ireland, has been criticised for asking pupils to leave their mobile phone with their teacher, sign out, get a key at reception and be accompanied to the bathroom where they are waited on. The all-girls school in Co Down only has three single disabled toilets that are currently in use.It is understood that previously there was only one toilet in use for the schoolaposs population of roughly , from the second week of November, BelfastLive reports. Some parents have taken to social media to speculate that the number of toilets being in use is because of previous reports of anti-social behaviour or a part of Covid- restrictions.  The school has since said it will not be commenting. Parents have also claimed there is a lack of communication from the school. Itaposs understood at least one of the bathrooms has no ventilation. One parent said theyaposre concerned for the well-being and health of students due to this new rule. They said an admin on the North Down Mums group claimed a pupil wet herself because she couldnapost get to the toilet.  They said: My niece had to stand for over  minutes waiting on the toilet, then the teacher came out and told her she had to get back to class and she struggled for the rest of the afternoon. Itaposs dreadful. My daughter and a few of her friends are struggling quite a lot. Theyaposre in Year  and Year , and some of them have just started their periods. They donapost really know in their bodies whataposs going on, and they need to get out to the toilet to check theyaposre alright. Their daughter said pupils are allowed into the toilet at break time and lunch, but because of the queues, not everyone can go during that time. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.She explained: Youaposre allowed into the toilet at break and lunch, we have  minutes at break which is  minutes to socialise and eat and prepare for our next classes. Then we have an hour for lunch, but the queue for the canteen usually takes about a half-hour to actually get in, never mind eating, and you also have to get ready for your next lesson. We have to leave our phones at the teacheraposs desk, walk to reception, then theyaposll show us to the toilet. Everythingaposs recorded so parents can see when youaposve gone to the toilet. My friend went and there was a queue of about  people, and they were all told they had to get back to class, so  of them didnapost get to use the toilet. Parents are hoping the policy will be reversed citing health concerns. They added: Weaposre not very happy about it - weaposre concerned for the girlsapos well-being and health. Thereaposs the risk of toxic shock for girls who are using tamponstheyaposre having them in all day and canapost get to the toilet. None of the parents have been informed about it either which has made a lot of us quite angry about it. That theyaposve just made this rule without informing the parents.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex went on a royal tour of Australia and New Zealand in October . The Times’ royal correspondent Valentine Low noted: “Harry had been pretty grumpy on that tour. “There was a long, and incredibly boring welcome ceremony in Fiji. And it was very interesting watching them both, because Meghan was sitting just absolutely perfect on a little throne, Harry was just glowering. “He was cross with the media, and he spent the entire welcome ceremony just erting his gaze to one side just to stare daggers at the press pack.”  The BBCaposs Jonny Dymond pointed to the Dukeaposs historic disgust for the media. He suggested: He [Harry] can’t bear the media. He has a visceral reaction to cameras, to notebooks, to journalists.Valentine also gave an example of when Prince Harry allegedly confronted the media as they travelled on the plane back to Sydney from Tonga.They said Harry was persuaded by his team to speak to the members of the media on board.  He claimed: He came back, and said something to the effect of, ‘thanks very much for coming guys - not that you were invitedapos. Again, Jonny suggested that this was an almost innate reaction on the part of the prince, saying: “He did it not because he thought, ‘I’m going to go back and insult them, he did it because he went back, he saw us, and he just [gestures to vomit] like that because it is absolutely built into him.” It comes as royal aides were said to be keeping a close eye on BBC’s The Princes and the Press, which looks at how William and brother Harry have been covered over the years. The Royal Family was reported to be furious at not having been given an opportunity to properly respond to claims made in the programme. The first episode, which was broadcast on Monday night, charted the years from the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in  up to the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in . Episode , out next week, examines the period from  to , and the royal tours of the Sussexes and the Cambridges. In a statement seen at the end of episode one, the Palace said: A free, responsible and open press is vital to a healthy democracy. However, too often overblown and unfounded claims from unnamed sources are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.

Rhea Spence, , fiance Callum Armstrong, , and their three children, Skyla, six, Mila, five, and Monaia, two, were forced out of their Middleton home for four days after numerous problems arose with the electrics as a new kitchen was being done. Rhea, from Rochdale, claims they were originally booked at the Holiday Inn but were turned away at nearly pm at night after they say they were told they did not take council emergency cases.The mum says the stay was booked through housing association Riverside, the Manchester Evening News reports. Rheaaposs future father-in-law paid for the family to stay at the Village Hotel in Bury after they were turned away. Their house, which is owned by Riverside Housing, was deemed unsafe by their kitchen contractor. The family are now back at home after spending four nights away.  Rhea said: In the middle of September, we had a new kitchen fitter, who put all new electrics into the kitchen. Since having the new kitchen I have had numerous problems with the electrics in my property - numerous appliances that have now broken over the last two to two half weeks due to the problem with the electrics. She says the problems had caused two microwaves and a kettle to break. She added: My whole family were left to go into emergency accommodation as my property is deemed unsafe and at risk of fire and electrocution. We have no heating and I have small children. When we got there we were turned away by the hotel and told they do not take council emergency cases. This was at .pm when children should be warm and in bed - we now had nowhere to go with three children at nearly pm at night, because we had no home to go back to as it is deemed unsafe. We didnapost have any problems before the new kitchen was fitted and we have lived there for five years. I have anxiety and I have recently come off my medication because I had been working on it but itaposs made it go through the roof. I just want to be out of the property - I now feel that itaposs dangerous. Fixing the electrical problem required the front garden to be dug up and the family lost £ worth of shopping from the fridge and freezer because the electricity was cut off.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email. Joanne Scarlett, Riverside’s Head of Asset Strategy and Delivery for North of England, said: “I’m extremely sorry to hear about the problems that Rhea and her family have experienced with their kitchen replacement and the subsequent handling of their complaint. “The works were carried out by an experienced contractor on our behalf and we were assured they had been completed successfully. “However, it is clear there have been problems and, as a result, we have suspended all work by the contractor pending a quality assurance investigation. “This left Rhea and her family in need of temporary accommodation and, again, they experienced problems. We also responded ineffectively to her complaint about the issue.  “We will be contacting her directly to apologise because it is clear we caused further frustration in our handling of the issue. She is right to point out she should be reimbursed for any costs incurred as a result. We are in regular contact with her and are in the process of making arrangements for this. “There are many lessons to be learned from this case and I will be picking these up with my team and other teams around the business as a matter of urgency.” A spokesperson for Holiday Inn declined to comment on the incident, saying: We are unable to comment on inidual bookings due to guest confidentiality.

John Lewis said it will robustly defend itself against the claims, saying the concept for their advert was presented to them in early  - a year and seven months before Ms Evans published her book.Ms Evans told Lincolnshire Live : Since this advert came out two years ago it has just been a really surreal experience. When the advert was released I was getting lots of messages from people saying that the story reminded them of Fred and initially I just thought it was a coincidence, until I actually saw the advert myself. Fay is now taking legal action against John Lewis and the creative team behind the  advert through the High Courtaposs specialist Intellectual Property Enterprise Court. After serving legal papers on John Lewis, which has now acknowledged theinfringement claim being made against it, the department store chain now has until December  to file a defence. But a spokesperson for John Lewis said: Having provided Ms Evans with the time-stamped documents that show the concept for our Christmas campaign was first presented to us in early  - one year and seven months before her book was published - we are surprised to have received this claim.  But Fay says that these time-stamped documents are utterly irrelevant to her case, as she says that the issue is not when the idea first emerged but about the creative process of transforming the idea into the advert. Fay is currently working with The Lowry theatre in Salford to turn Fred the Fire-Sneezing Dragon into a stage musical, having published her second childrenaposs picture book in . She added: Itaposs kind of soul-destroying to think that someone has used your work because especially as a childrenaposs author, I really have to use my imagination to come up with my stories and so they are a part of me. This is about standing up for creatives everywhere because the experience I went through was heart-breaking and I donapost want anyone  to have to go through it.

As a result, people are being encouraged to send their gts earlier. This makes it easier for the Royal Mail to process the packages and make sure they arrive on time.Royal Mail says: Allow plenty of time for posting. Please post items and gts for Christmas early, particularly for International deliveries.Ongoing Covid restrictions, reduced air and freight capacity, high volumes and winter weather conditions are all impacting transportation and local delivery across the globe.There was a large increase in packages sent over the Christmas period in  due to lockdown, but the mailing company is expecting a similar demand despite there being no lockdown restrictions this year. So why is Covid- still having an effect on Christmas deliveries  Why is the coronavirus pandemic still affecting deliveries   Last year, people were shut indoors. It meant that wrapping gts and hand-delivering them to loved ones was much more dficult, and people were encouraged to avoid doing this due to lockdown. Instead, people turned more often than normal to using postal services to deliver their gts. We believe the Covid- pandemic resulted in a structural sht, with a permanent step up in the level of parcel volumes compared to pre-pandemic levels, driven by increased online e-commerce activity, the Royal Mail said. It is part of a range of factors that may affect deliveries this Christmas, such as the shortage of HGV drivers. However, Royal Mail CEO Simon Thompson recently said that the shortage of drivers will not affect deliveries this coming Christmas. Due to the increase in packages processed by the company over the festive period, people are being encouraged to send their gts as early as they can.

Now distressing audio recordings played to the jury have been released which shows little Arthur crying out that no-one loves me four times in a -seconds. In another audio clip, Arthur cries that no-one is going to feed me seven times over -seconds.  Voice notes of Arthur crying sent from Tustinaposs phone have been prominent over the course of the trial. The jury heard Tustin would often message Hughes within minutes of him leaving the home with an audio file of Arthur crying accompanied by a text saying words to the effect of started again or still going. The prosecution said Tustin recorded more  voice notes during the three-month period. Arthur has been heard calling for his uncle and grandmother in some of them.  He has also been recorded asking for a drink. While in other clips Tustinaposs voice could be heard saying stand still and issuing other similar instructions. The jury was also shown heartbreaking CCTV of Arthur struggling to put his duvet away after sleeping in a living room hours before his death. By June  last year the six-year-old was so frail he could barely pick his bedding up from the living room floor - where he had been sleeping - a jury has heard.  Hours later he would collapse of catastrophic and ultimately fatal head injuries. Tustin admitted one count of child cruelty, but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes denies child cruelty offences.

They looked at eight categories to measure their sentience, including Learning ability Ability to process pain How pain is registered in the brain Response to anaesthetics or analgesics Behaviours, including balancing threat against opportunity for reward and protection against injury or threat Experts have recommended that the animals should no longer be boiled alive without being stunned firsthand, and also said lobsters and crabs shouldnapost be sold alive to inexperienced handlers.In response to he groundbreaking study, the government is adding those animals to a bill which is currently being debated in Parliament. Under the Animal WelfareBill, lobsters, crabs, octopuses, crayfish, squid and cuttlefish will be recognised as sentient beings. The bill has been designed to ensure future laws have high animal welfare standards. and hopes yo bring about the creation of an Animal Sentience Committee, which will publish reports on how well government decisions have taken account of the welfare of sentient animals. Jonathan Birch, a professor at the London School of Economics and a principal investigator of the study, said pain and suffering - and an animalaposs ability to feel those - have a particular relevance in animal welfare laws.  “When you respect something as a sentient being, the sort of principles you accept for other sentient beings have to apply,” Birch said. “Humane slaughter requires training. These are principles people readily grant for any vertebrate.” However, the report could not find a humane way which would be commercially viable to kill octopus and other cephalopods for human consumption. Currently fishing boats in Europe slaughter them by clubbing them, slicing their brains or asphyxiating them in a suspended net bag - all ways which the report said is not acceptable. Animal Welfare Minister Lord Zac Goldsmith said in response to the LSE report: The science is now clear that decapods and cephalopods can feel pain and therefore it is only right they are covered by this vital piece of legislation.

The pharmaceutical giant will pioneer ways of growing working human organ tissues in labs there including hearts, kidneys and ing lung cells.Currently drugs are tested on hundreds of thousands of animals in Britain - mainly rodents - and usually require the animal to be killed.The firm mass produced the Oxford University vaccine that was the main driver behind Britain’s quick rollout of Covid- jabs without profit and has vaccinated more poorer countries than any other. The Prince of Wales, who went to university in Cambridge, said: “Throughout the pandemic I have greatly admired the dedicate commitment of Pascal [Soriot, chief executive] and the entire AstraZeneca team. “You have developed and delivered a vaccine for the world in a remarkably short timescale which will continue to have a positive impact on communities and society for years to come. “I must say it has been absolutely fascinating to see at least some of the work that takes place inside this centre and to think that, supported by interactions across the city and beyond, it will ultimately enhance and save the lives of untold millions of people around the world in the years and decades to come.”  AstraZeneca is expanding into research including growing tiny human organs in the lab so that drugs can be tested on them. Its new Discovery Centre in Cambridge will house , scientists and be one of the major research hubs in Europe. It will pioneer a new ‘heart in a jar’ technology which will see a beating organ grown in a lab and potential new drugs tested on it.  The mm human-engineered beating heart means drugs for a range of conditions, such as antidepressants, can be tested to seethey have side effects that impact on the way it s. Similar human ‘organoids’ will grow cells to mimic s of human lungs, kidneys and bone marrow. Its organ-on-a-chip technology will grow D structures of bone marrow cells to speed to the development of medicines for all cancers. Currently new experimental drugs are usually tested on animals at the early stages of trials to check they are safe before being tested on humans.  Stefan Platz, senior vice president for safety at AstraZeneca, told the Mirror: “Everyone would like to get to a position where at some stage we have enough confidence that no animal models will be needed. “This is a position that we should make some effort to get to for society. “In order to get there predictive in-vitro models will play a really fundamental role.” The Anglo-Swedish firm’s other research and development hubs are in Gothemburg and the US. Its Cambridge centre’s disc-like structure has  boreholes to provide natural geothermal energy, four cooling towers and a ground source heat pump that will save enough energy to power , homes. Prince Charles said: “If I may say so, I am also greatly heartened by the focus on sustainability which is clearly in this company’s DNA. “From the lab to the patient, you are embedding innovation in everything you do, in order to improve human, as well as planetary health. “Your mission to deliver net zero healthcare via the latest technologies, renewable alternatives and a circular approach, is one from which many within and outside of your sector can learn.” Comment MORE ON AstraZeneca plcPharmadermOxford UniversityPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace took the rare step of issuing a joint statement to the broadcaster.The first episode of The Princes And The Press, presented by Amol Rajan, included suggestions that negatives stories about the Duchess of Sussex were leaked by courtiers and there was a competitiveness between their respective households.The second episode, which will be aired next week, is expected to delve into William and Harryaposs rt. Royal aides are reported to be concerned it will include claims the brothers briefed against each other in the press through their advisers. The statement from the palaces said: A free, responsible and open press is of vital importance to a healthy democracy. However, too often it is overblown and unfounded claims from unnamed sources that are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.It was unclear as to which particular allegations the royal households, who were not given an advance copy of the documentary, were referring to specically.  Monday nightaposs programme also featured Meghanaposs lawyer Jenny Afia, from the law firm Schillings, who responded to reports about the duchessaposs alleged bullying of palace staff. In March, The Times newspaper said the duchess allegedly drove out two personal assistants and humiliated staff on several occasions, which she denies.  An investigation has since been launched by Buckingham Palace and the royal household has tasked an external legal team to assist its human resources team looking at allegations made against the former Suits star. Ms Afia said: Those stories were . This narrative that no one can work for the Duchess of Sussex, she was too dficult and demanding as a boss and everyone had to leave, itaposs just not true. Following the airing of the programme, The Sun reported that William has always banned aides from briefing against family members after seeing the fall-out of his parentsapos media attacks during their split, dubbed the War of the Waleses. The documentary also featured a private investigator who apologised for targeting the phone of Harryaposs former girlfriend Chelsy Davy and admitted he helped rob the prince of his teenage years.  Gavin Burrows, speaking publicly about the issue for the first time, said there had been a ruthless culture in parts of the media in the early s, when he said Miss Davyaposs phone had been under surveillance. Editors told him that putting Harry on the front page sold more copies of newspapers than William. As explained to me by a couple of editors, Harry had basically become the new Diana, he said. The BBC says Mr Burrows is a witness in legal cases against the News of the World and The Sun, but that his claims are yet to be tested in court and are strongly disputed. Mr Burrows said he was very sorry and added: I was basically part of a group of people who robbed himof his normal teenage years.Donapost miss the Mirroraposs regular royal podcast Pod Save The Queen, with royal correspondent Victoria Murphy and host Ann Gripper.Listen on iTunes, Audioboom and your favourite podcast apps.Catch up with Episode  - Royal Wedding Bells for Meghan and Harry.  The News of the World folded in  after details emerged of extensive phone hacking at the newspaper. The paperaposs publishers, News Group Newspapers, have settled several claims brought against it by a number of high-profile celebrities, including Hugh Grant and David Tennant, but has never made any admission of liability in relation to allegations involving The Sun. The High Court heard last year that a journalist at The Sun was sent Ms Davyaposs phone billing data, which had been illegally obtained, by another private investigator. Documents disclosed to the claimantsapos legal team were said to reveal a South Africa-based private investigator, Mike Behr, sent Ms Davyaposs phone records to The Sunaposs then-royal correspondent, Duncan Larcombe, in a May  email titled March records.

Texo Johnson was  when and his friends were ly accused of trying to mug Det Sgt Derek Ridgewell, later unmasked as one of the UK’s most corrupt officers. Mr Johnson was cleared by the Court of Appeal at a hearing in the Royal Courts of Justice in London. Sir Julian Flaux, sitting with Lord Justice Dingemans and Lady Justice Andrews, said it is “most unfortunate that it has taken nearly  years to recty the injustice”. Arrested at the south London tube station during a night out in February, , all six pleaded not guilty, but all except one were convicted, despite telling jurors that police officers had lied and subjected them to violence. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates miscarriages of justice, referred Mr Johnson’s conviction for assault with intent to rob to the Court of Appeal after judges cleared the names of three of his friends. Courtney Harriot, Paul Green and Cleveland Davidson, now in their late s, saw their convictions ruled unsafe by the court in July. Judy Khan QC, representing Mr Johnson, who now lives in the US and did not attend the hearing, said it was a “truly shocking” case. Ridgewell was investigating mailbag theft, when he joined two criminals in splitting the profits of stolen mailbags. He was jailed for seven years, and died of a heart attack in prison in  aged . His corruption has led to eight wrongful convictions being overturned by the Court of Appeal.

I ended up having four doses off a chemo drug that saved my le my heart started again.Amy is now feeling much better and hoping tohome to her daughter and fiance Charlie.  She needed a heart transplant due to suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle where it becomes stretched and thin. This means her heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively. Amy has been taking medication since she was diagnosed with the condition aged eight. Last December, Amy discovered she was pregnant and was informed by doctors that she could no longer take her heart tablets due to the risk to her unborn babyaposs health. When she was  weeks into her pregnancy, her health took a turn and she was required to stay in hospital and needed a pacemaker.Ivy Rae was born in June through a cesarean section due to Amyaposs declining health.Amy said: Doctors came to me on the th and saidthey didnapost bring Ivy Rae the next day I wouldnapost have made it, my body was too weak my heart was failing massively. Two days after giving birth, Amy was fitted with a pacemaker and was able to go home, but she was brought back to hospital six weeks later after falling ill from a blood clot. After being rushed into surgery for a le-saving biventricular assist device, fitted to help pump blood around her body as her heart was failing, Amy was put on the urgent transplant list in September. A donor match was found but after undergoing the transplant, Amyaposs antibodies began attacking her new heart and she was on le support for  days. It was unlikely at that time that she would survive, but she was able to somehow make a recovery.  She recalls waking up one day attached to wires and medical equipment and the medication she was on meant that she didnapost even recognise her fiance. Since her unexpected recovery, she is slowly working towards feeling herself again, and is currently in hospital learning to walk again for the third time. She feels hopeful that she will be able to get home to her family soon. Amy has emphasised the importance of having an organ donor register, which all people in the UK are now automatically enrolled onto unless they opt out. She added: I really think people should be on the organ donor list asit wasnapost for a kind soul being a donor I wouldnapost be here today and I wouldnapost have had the chance to watch my daughter grow.

As the potential increases for more wet weather and impacts from rainfall and wind, Brits are being encouraged to make themselves aware of their own flood risk.The Environment Agency is reminding people they can check the flood risk attached to their property online, sign up for warnings, andthey are at risk, know what to doflooding hits their home. The call comes at the start of Flood Action Week, as the agency disclosed findings from a survey which suggested three-fthsof households in flood-risk areas did not believe their property could be affected. While % of households in at-risk areas had taken some steps to prepare for their home flooding, % had done nothing.  If replicated across England, this could mean as many as . million homes at risk of flooding are unprepared. Will Lang, head of civil contingencies at the Met Office, said iability was the defining characteristic of UK winters, with a mix of all types of weather. Such changeability has already been seen since the end of summer, with some flooding this autumn and a cold snap hitting this week. But he said that looking at the big global drivers which impact weather in the UK, such as the La Nina climate pattern in the Pacic, showed indications that the winter could see more prevalence of systems coming in from the Atlantic with milder, wetter and sometimes windier conditions. The outlook also shows an above average chance of a milder than normal winter - which he said was in line with warmer winters driven by climate change.  Cold weather spells and impacts such as snow do remain possible, and these cold weather impacts are more likely during the first half of the period, up until Christmas, Mr Lang said. There is a higher chance overall than normal of wet conditions, and also that implies that there is a higher likelihood of impacts from rainfall and indeed from winds, especially later in the period, January and beyond that, he said. The EA estimates . million properties in England are at risk from floods. Those at risk are urged to follow advice to protect themselves by packing medicines, insurance and other documentsthere is a flood alert, and visit the flood warning information service. If there is a flood warning, those potentially affected should act by moving family, pets and belongings to safety, and turn off gas, water and electricity. If there is a severe flood warning, those affected are encouraged to survive immediate danger by following the advice of emergency services or calling needed.  The Environment Agencysaid it has  mobile pumps and , trained staff ready to take action to protect communities from flooding this winter, while construction and repair of flood defences has also continued throughout the year. In late October, when parts of the country saw a monthaposs worth of rain in  hours, some  households were flooded but more than , properties were protected by flood defences and action the EA took, it said. But Caroline Douglass, executive director of flooding at the Environment Agency, warned it was now the time to be “vigilant”, rather than complacent, about flooding. She said the EAaposs previous investment programme protected , properties from flooding, defences helped protect nearly , properties during floods since  and the organisation was investing millions in building new schemes and making repairs to keep communities safe. But she warned that climate change was happening, increasing the frequency and intensity of storms, pointing to Storm Christoph and other recent storms in the past few years which broke records for rainfall or river levels, as well as the deadly flooding in parts of Europe this year. We canapost prevent all flooding - climate change is only increasing that risk - and todayaposs figures show that while some people are prepared, many are not. Itaposs vitally important for the public to go online and checkthey are at risk, sign up for Environment Agency warnings, and know what to doflooding hits, she said. There was also a warning for drivers - as just cmof flowing water is enough to float a car. Tony Rich, from the AA, urged drivers to allow plenty of time for journeys during heavy rainfall as roads could quickly become impassable, and to leave twice as much space from the car in front to allow for greater stopping distances. He said: Drivers should take extra care where roads dip, for example under bridges, as these areas are more likely to flood. Floodwater can be deceptively deep, and it doesnapost take much for water to get sucked into your engine. It can also mask other hazards in the road, such as displaced manhole covers, soin doubt turn around and find another route.

Beth Clyde,  was diagnosed with Hogkin’s Lymphoma just days before the first lockdown in March , Glasgow Live reports.Leading up to her le-changing diagnosis, Beth had a bad cough, sore throat and was struggling with extreme fatigue. Following a trip to the doctors for an X-ray on her lung and a biopsy, it was discovered she had tumours. Beth said: “I remember being confused, and initially I was overwhelmed and upset, but then after I had time to digest it I was relieved to have an answer. I’d felt so bad for so long and I was worried I was going crazy.  “My friends and family were devastated, but were trying to be a strong support network for me. I told my mum to tell meshe was upset or worried and she said no, but I think she was hiding how she felt because she wanted to protect me.”Beth from Glasgow was required to undergo  rounds of gruelling chemotherapy beginning in April last year, but due to the coronavirus restrictions at that time, she could not have any family or friends visiting her. However, her friends came to see her at her window and dropped off small gts at her door to lt her spirits. The chemotherapy also had a number of side-effects that were dficult to endure, such as severe fatigue, hair loss and neuropathy.She also suffered with a horrying ten-day battle with le-threatening sepsis after a bacterial infection seven months in, which saw her body temperature rise to a concerning C.It was the worst experience Iaposve ever had, she said. I was so sick because my immune system was so low. I was hallucinating due to my brain heating up. I even saw Death in the corner of the room. It was was brutal. I had to wait to get better before I started chemo again.  Beth said that the moments she remembered the most however was the kindness and chit chat she received from staff and volunteers. She fondly recalls how members of hospital staff, from medics to the porters, would visit her bedside and talk to her. “Someone always sat and made sure I was okay. Not having my friends and family around shone a light on how amazing the NHS are, she said. Everyone just chats away to you and keeps you occupied. That got me through when I was feeling lonely.When she wasnapost in hospital, Beth spent lockdown at home shielding with her mum, who had taken time off from her job as a social worker. Beth added: “I spent a lot of time during lockdown cleaning my room and drawers! But there were days I was too tired and I’d stay in bed or lie on the couch. We sat in the garden a lot during the summer. I’m so glad I had somewhere to go other than the house. It helped it go much quicker. My mental health was okay – I knew I had a goal to get to with my health. so I was concentrating on that.”  On October , , Beth and her mum were brought in and told by the doctor that she was in full remission. “It’s wild the relief I felt – I was so happy and couldn’t stop smiling. My mum was so emotional too. It was the best day ever. It made me realise how much I have overcome. “We couldn’t do much to celebrate due to lockdown, so we got a Chinese takeaway afterwards.” In the year since, Beth has been living her le to the full. She donned her graduation robes for photos at her university after the ceremony last year was cancelled due to covid. She has ed to her part-time job, is back training in the gym and heads up town for nights out with her pals at the weekend. She even threw a party with  friends and family at pub The Locale at Charing Cross to mark a year in remission last month. “It has been so emotional being back with everyone again. It’s so nice to have a bit of normality – it’s crazy how much you want it when you don’t have it for a year. I’m really lucky. “Ive got four years to go before I’m officially cancer-free, but I’m doing well and not on any medication.” The -year-old has urged Glaswegians to back the Beatson Cancer Charity this Christmas – as you’ll never know when you or a loved one will need it. “It’s the best wee centre in the world and it was my second home in  – for people from all over Scotland.

The moment saw the mischievous pup, called Sally, unrecognisable and more like a muddy monster spaniel – but luckily her owner saw the funny side. Nicola Phillips, from Redditch, Worcestershire, says she decided to take Sally and her border collie, Maggie, on a longer walk after having the day off work. The family clambered into the car, but the last thing Nicola expected was for Sally to bask in a mud bath in the way she did. While on a walk at Ipsley Meadows, the curious pup decided it was best to e head first into a muddy puddle that she found and roll around until not an ounce of fur was peeking through.  Nicola, , said: “I had to burst out laughing and let her carry on, she was enjoying herself, but unfortunately no-one  was around to see it – such a shame. “I knew I had to take some pictures of this because she has never done it this bad before. Once she had finished we just carried on walking, but I was thinking there is no way she is going in the car like that.”  Luckily, there was a stream for Sally to soak in. Nicola managed to throw the ball into the deep end which encouraged Sally to wash off most of the mud. After a lot of playing ball and shaking, they were just about ready to face the car journey home. Nicola said: “I wanted to wear her out so we had a bit of peace at home. If you have a spaniel, you know what I mean. “But to be honest I really don’t mind her doing this in puddles, I find it funny and I could not stop laughing.

In a video titled “My husband said he would clean the house while I take the kids out”, Chrissy could be seen going around her house and picking out spots that she could check for signs of cleaning later – by leaving piles of glitter. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Chrissy left three piles of glitter around her house which she then cleverly covered with items such as candles and jars so that she could lt the items when she got home to checkthe glitter had been wiped away. The following day, Chrissy posted another video where she showed the results of her test – and the experiment had mixed findings. The first pile of glitter, which was covered by a candle placed on a windowsill, had been smudged but was not completely clean. The second pile – located on a shelving unit and hidden under an air freshener – was left untouched.  But her husband redeemed himself in the end, as the third pile in the kitchen was absolutely spotless. And people in the comments of the videos – which have a combined  million views – are torn, as many of them have admitted they also don’t move items when dusting down surfaces. One person said: “Iaposm going to be honest,something is in its designated spot, I donapost move it to clean. But Iaposll admit Iaposm lazy.” While another wrote: “I rarely move things when cleaning unless it needs it. None of those looked like it needed to be moved.” But others on TikTok hit back insisting those who don’t move items need to learn how to clean all over again as they’re not “cleaning properly”. Someone posted: “Let’s just put this straight - you’re not cleaning properlyyou’re not moving things to clean the surfaces!” As another said: “You’re all acting like it’s so much effort to lt a candle and wipe under it. That’s not a deep clean.” And a third added: “First wrong move - they don’t move things when they clean! At least they clean though.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Maltese Charly has regular playdates with her neighbour, a pug called Peggy, after the pair became “instant best friends” the very first time they met, according to Charly’s owner Kaylee. Now Charly eagerly awaits the arrival of her new friend each day, as the cute clips show. Charly is always on the lookout for Peggy, and is ecstatic when the pug comes around to visit. “Charly is always waiting and watching Peggyaposs house to see when she comes out,” Kaylee, from Midwestern US, says. “If we even mention Peggy’s name, Charly gets so excited and runs over to the back fence to seePeggy is there.”  The pair’s owners try to arrange playdates for the pups as often as possible - and when they get together, Charly and Peggy spend all day playing games. “They love to chase each other and take turns being the chaser and runner,” Kaylee says. One clip also shows Charly adorably sharing her favourite toys for Peggy to play with.The videos were posted on TikTok by@charlythemaltese , where thousands of followers await each instalment of the pair’s adventures.“What a beautul friendship, it melts my heart,” one person commented on a clip of the pups playing together. “They always make me smile,” another said.Charly and Peggy aren’t the only pair that have been melting hearts with their friendship lately, but some dogs have a more unusual choice of best friend - likespringer spaniel Marley .Six-month-old Marley became firm friends with his owner’s cat Horner, and the pair love to sneak off for a cuddle and snooze together in the afternoon. The bond between the two surprised even their owner, and the unlikely duo even love playing together and sharing food when they’re not snuggled up for a nap.

Eduardo Melendez, from Honduras, shared a spine-tingling clip which sees him walking towards the disabled cubicle at the end of the bathroom.According to the Daily Star, the TikTok user then looks right next to the toilet bowl and discovers a wall with exposed concrete on the left, with a paper sign inside the wall which reads: Enter. That is seriously spooky. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the clip, which has since been viewed more than  million times, sparked huge conversation in the comments, with many comparing it to a prison break, like something out of a Netflix series.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Someone pulled an El Chapo at the school, one follower commented, while another added: The school is the jail and itaposs going to be easy to skip now. In a follow up clip, Eduardo revealed what was inside the opening and what the sign was directing him to, as the camera revealed a secret room, which appeared to be hidden in complete darkness. There is nothing, he said, but not everyone agreed, with some followers swearing they noticed someone  there. No one saw a hand and sleeve where the enter sign is  one asked while another added: There is a hand under the paper that says aposenterapos you can see the fingers! And others were freaked out when they spotted what they claimed to be a face in the dark. You can’t tell me you don’t see the face,one viewer wrote, while another commented: Right at the end, looks like eyes peaking around the corner.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

What do you think about the cleaning hack  Let us know in the comments...Jade Kirk said: I used raw bleach on mine a few months ago and it hasn’t come back. Kirsty Lafay wrote: Clean with pure bleach, wait until it’s dry and maybe use a damp seal paint, that’s what I’ve had to do to ours. Paula Lawson commented: When I had loads of mould I was told to use bleach to wipe it off, then put gloss over it. It was a while before it came back to be honest. Hope you sort it out soon.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Pat OaposToole said: I moved into a house covered in mould like this. We threw on some protective gear and went to work with a bleach water mix, then painted with Kilz just like your recommendation. Havenapost had an issue in years. Andrea Gay replied: When my son was a student he often had trouble with mould in his digs. Once a month, they would wash mould away with warm water and bleach added. Other suggestions from Mrs Hinch fans included using white vinegar, getting a cactus and using hairspray. Lisa Burns said: Spray it with some white vinegar, once clean make sure it dries out completely then paint it with anti mould paint. Also you can buy disposable dehumidiers fairly cheap. I would put one on the windowsill. Donna Campbell said: I had that and put a cactus in the window. It has absorbed the moisture and no more damp.Carla Frankish replied: Scrub it then coat with hairspray.The NHS states that mould can be dangerous to your health, for more information please click here.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

changes in behaviour are offset by a build-up of population immunity.\"Projections are however based on the same family of models used in spring, which did not perform well - predicting a substantial summer surge that didnrsquot really arise.\": Vaccine passports in Europe brought people back to hospitalityThe expert group voiced concern that while the highly-transmissible Delta iant is currently outcompeting other iants - even those with \"immune escape\"mutations - there is still the possibility that it could be overtaken by another strain.The minutes state: \"While there was some reason to be optimistic, it was noted that there is room for evolution of the virus and we must not be complacent.\"Delta is currently outcompeting other iants with immune escape, but the virus had demonstrated signicant evolutionary tendencies and new iants could change that.\"There is genuine scientic credibility about the possibilities for greater transmission ndash some existing iants are more transmissible than Delta.\"There was an acknowledgement that the UK was at a high equilibrium compared to the EU and there is the possibility of a lsquodelta plusrsquo iant arising from high case rates, with the potential for vaccine escape.\"The Delta plus iant - also known as Delta AY.. - is a sub-iant of Delta which made up % of UK positive samples in the week ending November .The most recent evidence, published last Thursday by researchers at Imperial College London, indicates that it is more likely to cause asymptomatic infections and is around  per cent more infectious.However, they said it \"does not appear to dfer\" from the original Delta in any serious way - such as causing more severe illness or being more resistant to vaccines, though its increased transmissibility could lead it to overtake its predecessor.The Scottish Governments Covid- advisors stressed that vaccinations remain the \"main tool\" for battling the pandemic, and that this must include a focus on \"catch-up\" vaccinations to immunise iniduals who have never come forward for the jag at all as well as boosters to counteract fading immunity.Scotland experienced a surge after schools ed in August but, in England, cases have been high but comparatively even since the end of JulyThey also note the puzzle of why England has not experienced a signicant surge in cases since the summer, in contrast to Scotland, despite the Scottish Government retaining restrictions such as facemasks and home-working where possible.: Vaccines were supposed to get le back to normal - so why are scientists talking of lockdowns until  They state: \"Scotland and England have been in tandem for most of the pandemic but not since around the time of the Euros. Infections in Scotland peaked, then declined without intervention and are now plateauing.\"There is an unresolved question as to why England did not peak to the same extent. It may be because things are so delicate that small movements have produced big changes.\"High levels of infectiousness and high levels of vaccination is new territory but the infectiousness of Delta means that we cannot attain population [herd] immunity.\"The spike in neonatal deaths in September is being investigatedThe paper also noted that  members ProfessorAziz Sheikh, of Edinburgh University, and Professor Chris Robertson, of Strathclyde University, areto engage with the UK SAGE expert group regarding data on pregnancy and COVID-.The minutes note that \"vaccination rates for pregnant women are low, with pregnant women sadly making up a signicant proportion of those admitted to hospital with COVID-\", but added thatthere is also \"little published evidence on vaccination during pregnancy\".It comes after an investigation was launched into an abnormal spike in neonatal deaths in Scotland during September, when  infants died within  days of birth."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-people-resent-scotland-parliament","story":"I think it is clear from her previous contributions that Ms Stephenson is not a fan of the SNP.

Game over.John Dunlop, Ayr.FALSE POSITIVES IN PCR TESTSI AGREE with all of Joanna Blythmanrsquos points when she criticises Nicola Sturgeonrsquos recent moves on Covidbut I would like to emphasize a more signicant issue, that of PCR tests.PCR tests are the linchpin justication for government action on covid. A critical part of PCR is the Ct , and this is the number of amplications required to create enough DNA for analysis from a sample from a patient.Information on what Ct values are being used by testing labs has been sparse or non-existent, but a  study lead-authored by I Engelmann reports that labs often use Ct values provided by PCR kit manufacturers which are between  and  cycles.A more accurate method of diagnosis for Covid would be to take a sample from a suspected Covid patient and attempt to culture it inside cells, but this would be too time-consuming for mass screening of millions of people.Engelmann cites a  study lead-authored by J Bullard, where diagnostics were carried out on samples from PCR-Covid-positive patients by way of culturing. Bullard concludes: ldquoOur study showed no positive viral cultures with a Ct greater than .If, as this suggests, most positive test results are  positives then the government needs to radically rethink its covid response.Geoff Moore, Alness.SCOTS TORIES AND THE DEMOCRATIC WILLTHE distressing pictures from the Netherlands and Austria must surely act as a salutary lesson for Douglas Ross and the Scottish Tories.Of course, restrictions on our liberty are unwelcome, but measures taken by the Scottish Government are for our protection.

McDonald, Glasgow.RETURN OF HERD IMMUNITYI WAS astonished to hear the UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid claim at the weekend that ldquoEngland has the lsquoright measuresrsquo in place to curb infections.Askedthe government should be dusting off its Plan B and bringing in vaccine passports and mandatory requirements to wear face coverings, Mr Javid stated that he agreed with the Prime Minister that there was ldquonothing in the data that suggested the government should move forwards with Plan B.He went on to criticise other countries in Europefor not following the UK lead and ending Covid restrictions sooner.With UK infections now running at some , in each of the last few weeks, I find Mr Javidrsquos assertion that the UK is doing well quite extraordinary.It is as though the UK government is now deliberately pursuing a policy of lsquoherd immunityrsquo and thus wilfully exposing thousands of our fellow citizens to infection and adding yet more pressure on our over-stretched NHS.I find this truly shocking.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.NO CALL FOR FURTHER COVID PASSPORTSIMPLEMENTATION of the Scottish Covid passport system has had very little effect on younger Scots getting the jab, which serves to undermine Nicola Sturgeonrsquos plan to extend the passport system this week.There is now absolutely no justication in extending the passport system further and putting the hospitality industry in Scotland under threat of financial collapse.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Aberdeen.INTEGRATING HEALTH AND CARE SERVICESHENRY McLeish states that ldquoyou have to separate the hotel aspect of [residential care] from the care side when arguing about the need for free nursing and care world first, insists ex-FM, November .That comment could equally apply to the situation in hospital care where aspects of the service provided could be classed as hotel aspects.In integrating services, does this then give the government the opportunity to introduce hotel charges for hospital services And would this be seen as a more affordable than the alternative of providing free residential care in either residential care homes or nursing homes Interesting times and challenges ahead for the integration of health and care services, where a level playing field across both will be required ndash or, no doubt, legal challenges will follow.Bill Eadie, Gfnock."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13230977.jpg?type=article-full","title":"best-online-casinos-australia-real-money-pokies-table-games","story":"Wersquoll be walking you through each site and explaining what works and what doesnrsquot work about it, and wersquoll also be answering your most popular questions related to online gambling in Australia at the end of the article.Letrsquos start.

The change to non-fossil fuel energy will take place over a number of years, and during that period we will still need oil and gas, albeit in decreasing amounts.Oil companies and their contractors suppliers are already using ious means to reduce their own carbon footprint: power from shore, generated from wind farms or, hopefully, nuclear.In Norway, an increasing number of installations are operated from onshore, meaning fewer people offshore, so fewer helicopter flights.There are over , people employed in the UK oil and gas industry, two-thirds of that in Scotland. If you take a fth or sixth-generation drilling unit, with a core crew of  or , for continuous   operation, I doubtany amount of transition training would make % of them eminently transferable to the renewables industry.I worked in the oil industry, shipping and offshore, exploration and production for over  years, worldwide, as well as on the UK Continental Shelf . The move towards greater sustainability and reduction in emissions in the last  years far surpasses that of the previous .Finally, given the state of world politics and the potential weaponising of energy supplies , I would suggest that maintaining a high level of energy self -sufficiency is probably a good idea.Steven Matthews, Kilsyth.The First Minister has made many misjudgments but she has surpassed herself in coming out against the Cambo oil field development.It is, after all, just seven years since the independence referendum, when the SNPrsquos infamous paper on the benefits of independence was predicated on ldquoScotlandrsquos oil and a price per barrel in excess of . The future was financially rosy in an ldquoindependent Scotland.Her volte-face on this issue is entirely political and frankly has nothing to do with green jobs or the environment. She fails to mention the huge job losses coming down the road in the north-east, or her and her Governmentrsquos complete failure to create some of the highly-skilled green jobs that were promised.There is no answer to the questions about increasing our reliance on imported oil from regimes with appalling human rights records and where we have absolutely zero influence into working practices, never mind the environmental practices in extracting the oil.All areas where we have exactly those influences in extracting oil from the Cambo field. Her decision is a sop to the green lobby and in an instant will cast thousands of jobs onto the scrap heap.Finally, it rather looks like she has also misjudged her support in the north-east and not just the electorate but also fellow SNP MSPs. The case for independence is economically dead and the First Ministerrsquos ill-thought-out political decision will come back to haunt her.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.THE RETURN OF PROJECT FEARI READ all the letters from The Heraldrsquos Unionist correspondents and while I disagree with them, I have seldom felt so angry as I did on reading Jill Stephensonrsquos latest contribution .It seems incredible to me that Ms Stephenson apparently believes that Westminster governments in general, and this one in particular, have been such a rip-roaring success that Scotland should stay within a failing Union.In election after election we have to accept governments and their poisonous policies we never voted for, which have seen us ripped out of Europe after voting to stay, and where we have no right of veto, and no voice at the UN.However, it is one thing to disagree with and criticise political partiesbut in writing that ldquoa separate Scotland would be an unmitigated disaster Ms Stephenson goes beyond insulting a political party, in fact, she has gone beyond the pale she has insulted our nation.Her declaration implying that Scotland would be unable to become a successful self-governing country has all the hallmarks of Project Fear and the whine of the lsquotoo-small, too-poor, too-stupidrsquo chant which aims to erode Scotlandrsquos self-belief and self-confidence.Except that it isnrsquot working, Ms Stephenson, as opinion polls show that increasing numbers of voters are growing in confidence that Scotland can take its own future into its own hands, and be a world-class self-governing country because wersquore big enough, rich enough and smart enough.Ruth Marr, Stirling."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13232096.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kelvingrove-ice-rink-schedule-opening-next-week","story":"Images taken yesterday and shared by events firm Itison show the foundations and part of the roofof the festive attraction are now place.The outdoor rink is due to open to the public on December  and will be the UKs secondlargest.Almost , tickets were sold in advance of construction work getting underway last week.Itison founder Oli Norman said his vision for the winter attraction which will cost ldquosignicantly more than pound million was inspired by rinks in major cities including New York and Vienna.The rink wasdesigned by the company behind ITVrsquos Dancing on Ice andwill be covered by a clear marquee roof, he said, toensure skaters can ldquomarvel at our most loved building."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13232318.jpg?type=article-full","title":"book-deer-go-display-aberdeen-art-gallery-2022","story":"The Book of Deer will go on display inAberdeen Art Gallerynextyear, during theYear of Scotlands Stories.The tome, which dates to the thCentury,isarare example ofa pocketgospelbook,andwasproduced for private use rather than for church services.It is linked to the Monastery of Deer inAberdeenshire, which is knownby historians but whose location remains a mystery.The Book of Deer was likely written by an Irish scribe and is mostly inLatin, butcontains ScotsGaelic in its margins.It was probably looted during the wars of Independence in the thand thcenturies, and has been in the collection of Cambridge University since .The community heritagegroupThe Book of Deer Project, based inAden CountryParkinAberdeenshire,has securedpound,from the National Lottery HeritageFundto bring thethcentury text back to the areawhere itis believed to haveoriginated and to celebrate its .An illumination from the Book of DeerTheprogrammewillinclude afurtherarchaeological dig at the Abbey of Deer inAberdeenshire, thought to be the site of the early mediaeval monastery where the Book of Deer was annotated with the earliest written Gaelic.This community excavation will take place over ten weeksin summer ,the longest excavation yet,hoping to find theMonasteryof Deerfollowingyears of searching.Anne Simpson, chair of the Book of Deer Project,said: ldquoWe act as the catalyst for renewed interest, research and community engagement surrounding thebook in thenorth-eastof Scotland and beyond.

She explained that a formal decision on this would be announced next Tuesday, and that consultation with businesses would take place later this week.The First Minister said that extension of the scheme is likely to include a broader scope of businesses, such as indoor cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.

She said that the scheme may also begin to accept proof of a recent negative COVID- test as an alternative to the vaccine passport.Ms Sturgeon, who said that while she hoped to keep businesses across Scotland open throughout the winter, the Government has not completely ruled introducing harsher restrictions should the COVID- situation worsen. She has urged all business owners and employers to think carefully and #look again# at whether their employees can be supported to work from home, this winter.#While we hope we will get through winter without introducing further restrictions, we do have a duty to keep proportionate options under review,# she said.#We are publishing an updated strategic framework today, covering some of the issues have already summarised.#Finally, the First Minister urged the nation to stick as closely to the current guidance as possible in order to prevent the spread of COVID-.

Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The  year old lorry driver, from Aghay, Crosskeys, raised pound, for Marie Curie this year, bringing his overall fundraising total to pound,. James has participated in the Annual Belfast Marathon Walk for the last  years.He initially set out to raise money and awareness for the NHS after finding himself admitted to hospital following a serious health condition. When released, he decided to put his best foot forward at the Marathon as a way to say thank you to the NHS staff who cared for him during his hospital stay.James told the : “I’ve completed the Belfast Marathon Walk for the past  years.“It’s around eight or nine miles and any money raised goes straight to local causes and charities.“I’ve raised money for around  charities, including Turning Point in Ballymena, the Macmillan Cancer Unit, Mencap, the Kidney Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as well as Causeway and City Hospital.“This is my second time donating funds to Marie Curie and I usually try to pick a dferent charity each year.“I found myself in hospital a decade ago and I needed to have an operation. “The care I received from the staff was fantastic and I decided to complete the first Marathon Walk simply as a way of thanking them for helping me get back on my feet again.“As each year went by, I kept going and tried to help a dferent charity along the way. For example, a neighbour inspired me to donate to Macmillan Cancer Care.“I then chose a number of local charities so that all money raised goes to local causes to help local people.“I have now acquired  medals for each completed Walk and raised thousands which will hopefully be of some help to these deserving charities. “The Walks take me around two hours, five minutes - and what’s two hours, five minutes when you can use it to do some good.”TRUCK SHOWAs a trucker, James’ driving career has helped him get involved with a number of other fundraising activities.He explained: “Around  years ago, I was in Irvinestown, Fermanagh, where I heard about an upcoming Truck Show.“It didn’t go ahead but a group of about  drivers all met in a bar and raised around pound for Marie Curie.“A gentleman there said I should attend the Lady of the Lakes Festival, also in County Fermanagh.“I drove down to the Festival and met up with Joe Mahon and George Gordon and the NI Truck Show grew from there. “Joe owns Mahon’s Hotel in Irvinestown and George runs a haulage company in Lisburn.“A group of ordinary lorry drivers came together for the Truck Show which has now become an annual event.“Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus pandemic the Truck Show hasn’t been allowed to operate the past couple of years. “We were on course to top the poundmillion mark for monies raised for charities.“We are hopeful that the Show will be up and running next year and we will reach this milestone.”When asked how James felt about raising so much money for charity, he modestly responded: “I never really thought about it, to be honest!“When I first set out  years ago, I never thought that years later, I would still be doing it, but I’m still going and I hope to take part in the next one.“I do feel that I’ve achieved something, both for myself and the charities who hopefully will benefit from the funds.“It’s a great feeling crossing that finishing line and a great accomplishment to have raised some money along the way.“Sometimes people can view truck drivers in a bad light, but hopefully this will let people see a side to us that they don’t normally see.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637677532788.jpg--covid_19___tue_23rd_november_figures.jpg?1637677532000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211123newscovid 19 tue 23rd november figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

I want our hospitality to be open right through the Christmas period.His comments come after Robin Swann said on Monday that hospitality venues may have to close over the Christmas period in order to stem a rise in cases – although he stressed this was not “inevitable”.The First Minister, however, said the Executive is acutely aware of the economic impact restrictions has had on businesses, in particular the hospitality industry, pointing out financial safeguards are no longer available.There isn#t the furlough scheme or the hundreds of millions coming from London,” explained Mr Givan.I don#t think we#re in a space where we can be looking at closures.Ms O#Neill also said that rollout of the vaccination means we are in a very dferent place to where we were this time last year.“The predictions and the modelling tells us we could be in a very dficult position by mid Decemberwe don’t reinforce the messages,” she said.“We set out our winter plan that we had toolswe needed them and whenever health advice came forwards and said ‘now’s the time we need them’ we responded.”Mr Swann said the agreed plan would help keep society open and safe, adding: We know what we need to do, we know what has worked in the past.But we also know in comparison to this time last year we also have the benefit of the vaccination and booster programme, he added.Meanwhile, Mr Givan said his party, the DUP had not changed its stance on the contentious issue of Covid passports being introduced here.There are plans for the requirement to come into force across Northern Ireland on December . Before then, however, it will be put to the Assembly for a vote.This means there will be a vote before they come into effect.My position on that and that of my party has not changed, he explained.There are dferences at times in what the best approach is, both in the political institutions and right across the societies.What I#m appealing for is inidually we can all make decisions that will make a cumulative effort. You may not support a mandatory passport, but you can support being vaccinated and getting your booster jab. You can practise good hand hygiene, you can try to limit those contacts in indoor settings.All of us can take inidual actions.Related topicsRobin SwannMichelle O#NeillPaul GivanNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Robin SwannCoronavirus NI: What the Executive announced and what might change in the coming weeks PremiumConcern as ICU nurses quit jobs amid mounting crisis at the Belfast Health TrustExecutive slammed over decisions as it discusses new Covid curbs PremiumNI Covid restrictions: Apathy and mixed messages to blame for drop off in wearing of masks, says professorCoronavirus NI: Health Minister warns hospitality venues may have to close over ChristmasMost ReadIntervention required, says NI Executive on new Covid measures to ‘step up effort’ on halting virus spreadSilence from Orange Order after members attend Tweed’s funeralRevealed: Northern Ireland#s Top  Companies  – Full list‘Strictly confidential’ Belfast Trust files found in desk bought at charity shop – including report on protecting dataNewry couple Patsy and Peter McAteer who died within hours of each other laid to rest on same dayTop VideosPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayNorthern Ireland Executive reinforces work-from-home guidancePlayLook at NI#s first mobile seaside SaunaLatest CoronavirusGail WalkerOpinionWhen will someone take responsibility for the virus here  This is about action now, not messagingThreat of closing hospitality sector ‘bonkers’, say Derry business ownersCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageUK Government refuses to put timetable on Article  use after minister#s Christmas claimLatestGovernment ‘disappointed’ by French fishermen’s threats to block exports to UKThomas Tuchel ‘worried’ by Ben Chilwell injury after Juventus routCampmates have made me comfortable to share ‘more personal stuff’ – Kadeena CoxCrusaders quick to narrow gap on their title rivals with victory over DungannonCha run riot against Juventus to take control of Champions League group,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Moneyneena woman, along with her husband Chris and young son Oisin, had just moved into their new home in Portstewart weeks before lockdown hit in March . The  year-old was on maternity leave at the time and toyed with the idea of releasing her own music. After uploading one of her songs onto her social media account, Kate was spurred on to keep writing following a positive reaction to her music. “I have been writing songs since I was  but I just never really got the chance to go down this road properly,” explained Kate, who is better known in Ballinascreen as Catherine Kennedy. “It really all happened during lockdown and maternity leave. The whole world shut down so I kind of found myself needing a creative outlet so I went down this path and started off with one single and it turned into the whole album.” Growing up in rural County Derry, Kate was inspired by the musical talent all around her. “Ive loved music as long as I remember. Draperstown is a great hub for music,” the former St Eoghans Moneyneena and St Patricks Maghera student said. “The likes of Maurice Regan and Glasgowbury brought music into the town. I actually live a mile from Glasgowbury so Ive always looked up to the scene. “Ive worked in Danny Ottersons music shop in Maghera and I worked in the Empire Music Hall as well when I was younger so I always had lots of music around me.” Even though she has been singing at wedding ceremonies and other events in local churches since the age of , with some encouragement from her older brother, Kate decided to explore songwriting. “My brother bought me a guitar for my seventeenth birthday and suggested I maybe try and write some of my own songs, so thats when it all started and it was always a nice distraction from doing A-levels,” she said. Fast forward  years and Kate has just released her second single Wrong Side of the Town from her upcoming debut album Fallen from Grace, due for release in the New Year. The new single, which features the unmistakable vocals of Cormac Neeson, lead singer of The Answer and successful solo artist. Despite the new song only being released five days earlier, Hotpress announced it as its track of the day on Wednesday. On Friday night past, Kate and Cormac performed the song live for the first time at an In the Round night of music with Sound of Belfast in the Empire Music Hall. The gig was one which Kate had been dreaming about for some time. “I used to glass collect thereand I used to look up at that stage and listen to all the amazing music so its a bit of a dream that this is happening,” said Kate. “Im a really big fan of Cormacs. He was one of the acts that stood out to me when I worked in the Empire. He was playing in his band The Answer and I had to rub my eyes to check it wasnt Robert Plant. He has just one of the best voices in the industry, I think. “I worked with Mojo Furys frontman, Michael Mormecha for the album and I told him that I would love Cormac to sing on this song and he just asked him and sent him the song and he said he was up for it. “Its really funny, a year before this all came about, I was at a gig and Cormac was playing at it. I said to my husband Chris how cool would he be on Wrong Side of the Town  I had the song written and had this all in my head and its happened. Its pretty cool how it worked out. “This is one of my favourite songs to date. I love the blues rock sound we have achieved using inspirations from some Deep South Americana  Blues music and some soundtracks I love, such as True Detective and Sons of Anarchy. “Wrong Side of the Town explores the often fine and blurry line that can exist between having a really great time, and that of self destruction. The song aims to look at this from ious angles.” Kate, who recently became a mum for the second time to baby Tomas, now three months-old, admits that her music doesnt fit neatly into any category and she is heavily influenced by a iety of artists. “I love a big range of music but Dolores ORiordan of The Cranberries is one of my icons. I also like Amy Winehouse. Theres also a big American theme running through my music,” she continued. “I call it alternative country rock – the closest thing to it would be Sheryl Crowe - it doesnt fit neatly into any category.” So, with her newest single receiving rave reviews and an album launch just around the corner, Kate says she is looking forward to more live performances and is even thinking about her next project. “Ive been delighted with the reaction to the singles – Wrong Side of the Town and Street Lamps - I got really great support for it and Im just looking forward to getting the whole album out and hopefully there will be a nice celebration for it. “Im also looking forward to being able to perform to a live audience. Ive played live over Zoom through a group called Mothers in Music with the Oh Yeah Music Centre who have been really supportive. “Charlene Hegarty from Maghera is the talent development officer with the Oh Yeah Music Centre and she has been helping us Mothers in Music as a group. Its been lovely to have her support. “Theres just something very special about playing live in front of real people. Its so dferent compared to performing over Zoom – its like night and day. Zoom was brilliant for the times that were in it but live music is where its at. Theres just something about the atmosphere and having people in the room at the same time. “Thinking about the future, I love Irish traditional music as well so Im kind of thinking along those lines for the next project maybe. Its something a bit dferent.” Kate says she enjoys making the trip home to Moneyneena once or twice a month and says she is delighted with the support she has received from locals. “I love Moneyneena. Its a gorgeous part of the world. I am delighted to still be living in County Derry, so Im not too far away. “Ive been really taken aback by how supportive people have been. Ive had really nice support and I couldnt be more grateful for their support and encouragement but I dont take anything for granted. Im just going to enjoy it,” she added.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

Derry is such a great crowd to perform in front of because everyones so supportive and everyone cheers and getsinvolvedand theyre just so lovely. I do always get nervous, especially on the opening night, just because its your first time doing it in front of a real audience, but at the minute Im more excited than nervous.” The pantomime is set to run  shows throughout the winter season beginning November  and wrapping up on January .

Everyone cannot wait to get back to those local audiences for the first Christmas panto in two years.” Conor is   of The Four Harps and is a co-founder ofGOLEM!a company specialising in repurposing and reimagining original texts.

Our first time working together professionally as adults was when we did Snow White in . “Its nice just to sort of circle back and come back to where we both started because we both did the Youth Theatre at the Millennium forum as well. “There is such a buzz around the building and in rehearsals, it’s like getting back to the family, this isn’t the first time for a lot of us. “I think that its the same in the city. People are definitely really looking forward to doing something that feels traditionally part of Christmas, because they didnt get to do that last year. “It’s a whirlwind but we wouldn’t have it any other way.” Tickets for this year’s pantomime are available at the box office or atmillenniumforumADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

People are definitely really looking forward to doing something that feels traditionally part of Christmas, because they didnt get to do that last year. “It’s a whirlwind but we wouldn’t have it any other way.” Tickets for this year’s pantomime are available at the box office or atmillenniumforumADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Creator and writer of Derry Girls, Lisa McGee, saw the social media campaign and said yes to his request. Eamonn was born with cerebral palsy which affects his movement and speech. The -year-oldgraduated from his drama course in summer this year and wants to follow his dreams to be a writer and actor. Speaking to the BBC, Eamonn said: I want to inspire people to chase their dreams to write and act. I think its great to show that some things are possible evenyou have a disability. I had a massive smile on my face. His friend Sean added: For Eamonn to have a degree and have cerebral palsy is a massive deal for him and his family. Hes a massive Derry Girls fan so we decided to push hard to get on it. Eamonn messaged the cast directly and I tried whatever influence I have on Twitter to contact Lisa McGee too. It might be a small thing to be an extra in the cast but this was a massive opportunity for Eamonn. We cant say anything about the scene really, but Eamonn was in a pretty prominent position so hopefully he will be seen. Filming of season three of Derry Girls is underway in the city after it was postponed due to the COVID- pandemic.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Creator and writer of Derry Girls, Lisa McGee, saw the social media campaign and said yes to his request. Eamonn was born with cerebral palsy which affects his movement and speech. The -year-oldgraduated from his drama course in summer this year and wants to follow his dreams to be a writer and actor. Speaking to the BBC, Eamonn said: I want to inspire people to chase their dreams to write and act. I think its great to show that some things are possible evenyou have a disability. I had a massive smile on my face. His friend Sean added: For Eamonn to have a degree and have cerebral palsy is a massive deal for him and his family. Hes a massive Derry Girls fan so we decided to push hard to get on it. Eamonn messaged the cast directly and I tried whatever influence I have on Twitter to contact Lisa McGee too. It might be a small thing to be an extra in the cast but this was a massive opportunity for Eamonn. We cant say anything about the scene really, but Eamonn was in a pretty prominent position so hopefully he will be seen.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reporter: Jenner Grfiths Nov   addthis, I thought no it’s too early, nope Jen don’t write about Christmas yet, it is ONLY November! googletag.cmd.push BUT,I know some of you parents will soon be sayingI’ve done all my Christmas shopping, the adverts are on the TV, the songs are starting to be hummed, the children are starting to practice their Christmas songs and plays and the decorations are in the shops . So, I thought, Jen, sometimes you’ve just go to go with the flow… I had an article all ready for you about ideas for presents and then I thought STOP…what about those who dread Christmas, the cost of it, the feeling of how will I cope with the financial part, the wondering who WILL I borrow the money from to pay for everything  For some Christmas really is like this, me and you, can sit in our warm homes, circling the catalogues, putting things in our internet basket, searching and driving for miles for that present that cost hundreds of pounds whose novelty will have worn off by the new year. But for some families it’s dferent, wondering how do I pay for the oil, the bills, the school pants he needs as he’s grown so much and buy that second hand bike he’s got his heart set on. Me or you might say, just budget, save all year, a little every week and it’ll soon add up but for some it just isn’t that easy. I often think, and maybe we all should, ‘there for the grace of God go I’. So, sorry guys, my first Christmas article is about those less fortunate than us. Rather than circling those presents tonight, rather trying to decide between Marks  Spencers luxury goose or Sainsbury’s Finest three bird roast, think what can you do, actually do, to make a dference, to make Christmas special for others. Charity begins at home As a mum who has been skint, yep that was me, I tried to get things from the charity shop, so could you have a clear out, donate your old toys, or maybe even clothes, give them a wash and hand them in. Oh, but do make sure al the pieces are there, no boy wants a train track that doesn’t join together! Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, will take part in the parade which will light up the city centre as it passes through. He will be joined by a number of festive characters and Christmas themed mobile installations. “I am really excited to take part in the parade and see our beautul city lit up for the first time,” he said. “The route is extended around the city centre so that everyone will have their opportunity to see Santa and the characters and you can pick your viewing spot along the route rather than gathering in one place.  Santa Claus, along with an unusually long-eared Mayor Graham Warke, promote Derrys Christmas programme “After last year’s virtual programme, it is particularly pleasing to allow people to attend the switch-on in person again and Council’s maintenance and electrical teams have been working hard this week to ensure the city is looking resplendent on Sunday evening.” The full parade route for Sunday is Bishop Street, The Diamond, Ferryquay Street, Newmarket Street, Orchard Street, Foyle Street, Foyle Embankment, City Hotel Roundabout , Strand Road, Waterloo Place and Custom House Street. The switch on events in Derry this weekend mark the start of Council’s Christmas campaign and programme for .

Currently, the minimum wage rates are staggered with ious age groups earning separate levels of pay. Those aged  to  are entitled to pound. an hour,  to -year-olds get pound., those aged  and  receive pound. while workers of the age of  and upwards get paid an hourly rate of pound.. Cllr Harkin insists that minimum wage parity for all ages must be imposed and will call upon the Council to send a message to Derrys young people that they have their backs in their right for equal pay. He said: “If we want young people to have hope, to stay here and to thrive here, we need to shake-up the status quo propped up by corporations and the Stormont Executive. “The political establishment has been quick to ly demonise young people for spreading the covid virus – and some have tried to use young people as fodder for sectarian violence – but not a finger has been lted by Executive parties to challenge rip-off wages paid to young people. “Its unacceptable for - yr-olds to be paid only pound. an hour. Under-s are paid less pound an hour. What kind of message does it send to young people that they dont deserve even the basic minimum wage of pound.  “The cynical politics of ision constantly pursued by both sides of the unionist and nationalist establishment does nothing to help young people. “When it comes to standing up for young people its been blah blah blah from the Executive. “Theres been no anti-poverty strategy. Continued failure to properly expand Magee and create the type of infrastructure Derry and the North West needs. “Theyve done zero to promote voting rights for  and -year-olds. Student demands have been ignored. And, egregiously, the Executive has done nothing to challenge rip-off wages paid to young people working in key sectors. “We believe our Council should promote equal pay for equal work and be advocates for our young people, including education about trade union rights. Young workers should receive equal pay for equal work and their contribution throughout the pandemic should be properly acknowledged.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Many people, regardless of age, are taking on more caring responsibilities for their relatives and friends who may be disabled, ill or older and need support, and the project launches on Thursday, November , to mark International Carers Rights Day. Mayor Warke said he hoped to see lots of local schools bridging the generation gap and engaging with the scheme. He said: “By keeping people at the heart of what we do, we hope to encourage as many schools and pupils to reach out and engage with their family, friends and neighbours aged  plus years in a way suited to them, whilst linking the activities to the National Curriculum. “Intergenerational practice helps bring people together in a purposeful way, which promotes greater understanding and respect between generations, and contributes to creating more cohesive communities through mutually beneficial activities. “This can help build confidence, challenge assumptions and prejudice, and help tackle social isolation and loneliness in both groups. “Using this approach, the Council hopes to build upon the ongoing engagement being rolled out across the District to gauge the views of people aged  plus years.” The initiative is geared towards pupils in Key Stage Two of Primary School and also Key Stage Three of Post Primary schools, and participating pupils are encouraged to complete the activities either face to face, by telephone or digitally, to ensure the safest and most appropriate approach is used. Schools who get involved and participate in the initiative will be entered into a competition which offers a number of prizes include pound, a five-week onsite multi-sport coaching programme as well as a number of family swim passes. Schools will be receiving information on this initiative electronically and for further information please contact the Age Friendly Co-ordinator on    or by email: agefriendly@derrystrabane ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa, Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

A long-standing campaigner for greater road safety in Derry, Cllr Duffy has in the past helped bring about a pedestrian crossing on the Skeoge Road and also repairs to the safety railings there as well. She has also been vocal on the demand to upgrade the Buncrana Road to help ease congestion for vehicles heading to and from Co. Donegal. Cllr Duffy hopes her motion ahead of Thursdays main council meeting will help put pressure on the Executive to get Derrys roads sorted out. She said: “Despite a record allocation from Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy to the Department of Infrastructure which allowed for a structural maintenance budget of pound million, we are clearly not seeing the benefit of that investment here in Derry. “The historic lack of investment has now been exacerbated by the fact that resurfacing contracts in this council area have been delayed due to a legal challenge. “The result of all that is more misery for motorists dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment. “My motion calls on the minister to deliver that investment as a matter of urgency and I hope all parties can support it.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.    Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.    The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.    Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

James McClures th minute goal saw the Loup take a healthy six-point lead into the half time break, after the hosts had cut loose during the second quarter. However, St Patricks would not score for another  minutes, and their opponents used the time wisely, chipping away at the lead, with just the goal separating the sides at the second half water break. The Magherafelt side defeated in tonights Jack Cassidy Cup semi final. Loups composure had deserted them and by the time an Eoghan Hawe free reduced the gap to one on  minutes, the side in red looked the more likely winners. Time was on Rossas side, but just as the tide appeared to be turning, Loup rode the wave and hit back, John McClure tapping over a free with five minutes to go to settle the nerves. Aidan McAlynn then slotted another free, and despite a late Magherafelt onslaught that yielded a Dan Higgins point, the hosts held firm to reach a decider against Dungiven. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

If the proposed Mid Down College gets the green light, then it will close and become part of the new school.Cllr Walker said he understood the constraints Blackwater was operating under and that there was no room to expand at its Old Belfast Road site, suggesting that it should also relocate to Down Highrsquos current site when it becomes available.The Rowallane politician has again insisted that he supports integrated education and was behind the proposal to create Drumlins Integrated Primary School in Ballynahinch and Killyleagh Primary Schoolrsquos decision several years ago to embrace integrated status.He said he was ldquoin no way attempting to turn the proposed Mid Down College proposal into a political football, branding such a suggestion as ldquoludicrous.Cllr Walker also rejected claims from Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown that the DUP narrative in the post-primary school proposal was ldquoshort-sighted and  in parts and that the steering group behind the new Mid Down College had no intention of taking students away from other schools.Accusing the Alliance man of being ldquodisingenuous, Cllr Walker said his party is not anti-integrated education.In addition, he rejected Cllr Brownrsquos assertion that Newry, Mourne and Down Council did not want to meet with the Mid Down steering group to discuss its proposal.ldquoIt was agreed that steering group members, along with representatives from the other post-primary schools in the area who have concern about the new college proposal, would be asked to meet with a working group comprising elected representatives to outline their respective views, he said.Cllr Walker said that whatever happened moving forward, childrenrsquos education must always come first as they are the future of the district.He continued: ldquoThe bottom line for me is thatthe proposed Mid Down College impacts on existing schools, I will continue to point that out. We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do. The question I have for Cllr Brown is, has he done likewise .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_TUV.jpg","title":"‘Traditional Unionist’  McKee joins TUV weeks after his UUP departure  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has its first TUV councillor.Harold McKee mdash who recently quit the UUP over concerns about the leadership of the party under Doug Beattie mdash had intended to become an Independent member of the local authority, but has instead joined the TUV.The veteran Mournes councillor and former South Down MLA, says joining Jim Allisterrsquos party presents him with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people across his electoral area.This week, Cllr McKee has thanked the many people who have wished him well on his departure from the UUP and his political direction into the future.He explained that since announcing his resignation, he received an overwhelming number of positive messages of support on social media and via phone calls.ldquoI would take this opportunity to thank all those who took the time to message and telephone me, not only local people in Newry Mourne and Down, but also across the whole of Northern Ireland, said Cllr McKee.ldquoIt is often the case when a member leaves a political party that they receive offers from other parties to have a chat with members or indeed the leader to discuss potential future membership. Once again, I would thank those from other unionist parties for their words of encouragement in upholding my Christian faith in the political arena and their offers to have a conversation on my political direction.Cllr McKee confirmed that when he left the UUP, he notied the local councilrsquos chief executiveof his intention to become an Independent councillor for the immediate period to allow some time before deciding where his political future lay.He continued: ldquoWhile I had no intention of making a move to any party anytime soon, I was drawn on the basis of many of my messages and phone calls towards Traditional Unionist Voice.ldquoThis led me to read the TUV policies and manestos which, having read, I believe I am very much in agreement. One of the newspaper articles referred to me as a traditional Unionist and to be honest thatrsquos who I am.Cllr McKee said that following discussions with the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during which he set out the importance of his Christian values as a politician, he has taken up the offer of another party much earlier than he had intended.ldquoLike many people across Northern Ireland, I appreciate the strong and principled leadership Jim has offered, particularly in recent days when it has come to the Northern Ireland Protocol which is undermining our position in the UK, he continued.ldquoI feel that the ethos of TUV and the ever-growing number of members joining the party, particularly in the South Down constituency, provides me with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people of the Mournes.Welcoming Cllr McKee to the party, Mr Allister said he was delighted that he had decided to join the TUV.ldquoHarold is a conviction politician and as such is a good fit with TUV following his principled resignation from the UUP.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge. Based on the results that day, the Masters Association drew up teams of six plus one reserve for each age group -, -, - and so on.Jonny was duly notied that he was picked to run as reserve in the - category and so he turned up at Queens Playing Fields last Saturday, slightly concerned as to how he would cope given the standard of the runners.He had no need to worry as he paced it well and did himself and the club proud.He was rd in the end and completed the five lap muddy circuit in  odd minutes. He expressed his awe of the standard at the front of the race and felt that it was great to have the experience of being part of such a competitive event.This weekend sees the cross country season continue with a large EDAC squad heading to Comber for the Comber Cup and some juniors travelling to Santry in Dublin for the All-Ireland Even Age Group Championships as part of the Co Down team.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede. Our defence has been immense all year. You can talk all you want about Niamhand the forwards, but the defence was absolutely brilliant.ldquoWe are young and we are hungry and we are going to improve more on the back of what we achieved today.Portaferry: F McGarry, C Coleman, A Mallon, MJ Mageean, C Finnegan, D Coleman, C McKenna, S Sands, N Savage, M Fitzsimons, F Toner, C Coleman, C McConnell, E McGrattan, N Mallon .Subs: G McGrattan for C McConnell , E Gallagher for N Savage , M McNally for M Fitzsimons .Liatroim: N OrsquoToole, Aacute OrsquoToole, K McAleenan, D McCabe, O Brown, K McMullan, A Brown, SL Clarke, D Magee , A McCrickard , A McAleenan , E McAleenan, C Davidson, D Brown, N McKibben.Sub: O Blaney for C Davidson .Referee: Paddy Brannigan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_poppy.jpg","title":"Remembrance Sunday in Downpatrick  ","story":"THE future of the Remembrance Sunday commemoration in Downpatrick looks to be secure.Thatrsquos the message from the organisers after an encouraging attendance at Sundayrsquos parade and wreath laying ceremony.The future of the commemoration was in doubt owing to a decline in attendances in recent years.A few weeks ago, Mr Andy Campbell, chairman of the townrsquos Royal British Legion branch, issued an appeal for support and warned that this year parade might be the last in the county town.However, Mr Campbell said he was delighted at the level of support on Sunday, both in the number of people who took part in the parade and also by the attendance at the wreath laying ceremony at the cenotaph.Addressing the gathering from the steps of the cenotaph, he said: ldquoI would like to thank everyone who has come here today to remember those who gave their lives to safeguard our freedom.Afterwards he said: ldquoWe had approximately  people taking part in the parade and another  or so at the cenotaph.

He has been a very valuable asset to our union and will be sadly missed.Mr Pricersquos contribution will be acknowledged at the Annual Glamorgan County Dinner that is being held at Cardfrsquos Angel Hotel on Friday November .More than  guests and dignitaries will attend the black-tie dinner, with glasses raised to the Glamorgan first team who beat Devon last month at Long Sutton Golf Club in the final of inter-county league.It had been a long wait since , but the convincing - victory in Somerset - which came after Glamorgan topped their group with just one defeat in the entire season - was the perfect way for Mr Price to bow out of the role.As well as the first team, Price has assisted in running the junior teams and the seniors team. In his time working across these generations, he has steered the union on to a more secure financial footing, attracting new sponsorship and promoting all aspects of the game in the county.OTHER NEWS:Backed by a streamlined executive committee, Mr Pricersquos influence has seen coaching notably improved at all age groups. He has unashamedly been keen to increase the focus on junior golf, introducing handicap events for a section that now starts from under-s..removeIn this unpaid role, Mr Price attended most matches at all levels, spending hours supporting the teams on the course and in committee meetings to ensure they received the necessary backing.ldquoIt has been an honour and a privilege to be involved with the Glamorgan County Golf Union and I will look back with great fondness on the many happy hours with friends and colleagues over the last nine years, Mr Price, a four-handicapper said.ldquoIt is time to concentrate on my own golf game for a while, but I wish the county continued success and hope I will be able to renew my association in some way in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere we break down how Cardf and Vale University Health Board has performed in October .Ambulance response timesCardf and Vale had the highest emergency response rates in October according to the latest Welsh Government NHS Wales Performance data.For the health board,  lsquoredrsquo calls ndash calls which are for immediately le-threatening incidents ndash were received in October, with an emergency response sent out in  of these cases.Of these,  were at the scene to treat the patient within the Welsh Governmentrsquos eight-minute target. This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A new low for ABC Council. People rightly expect and deserve better.”He also said he would not be naming the person who allegedly made the comment “until we’re confident we can distinguish the inidual from the recording”.Councillor Peter Lavery said he will always stand shoulder to shoulder with anyone who has been bullied.“It was sad to hear Eoin,” said Cllr Lavery. “I will always stand shoulder to shoulder with anyone who gets abused no matter their background. They can always count on me to back them to take on the bullies.”Read this:- Late train service welcomedEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
