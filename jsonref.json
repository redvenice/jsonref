I know he\u0027s never going to start school and for them to send letters like this is just not acceptable.\u0027There\u0027s obviously nobody working in that department who has lost a child, or they\u0027d have realised what it does to you when every day is already a struggle. It\u0027s enough to tip you over the edge.\u0027It was initially thought that the letters had gone to around five families who had lost children, most of them premature babies.         Hollie Nightingale of Stalham, Norfolk, whose daughter Alissia lived just 20 minutes after being born 19 weeks premature, said she was shocked to receive the letter addressed to \u0027the parent or guardian of Alissia Chaplin\u0027But the council has now admitted that 42 letters were sent out to 41 bereaved families, including one who had lost two children.The council\u0027s leader Andrew Proctor and Sara Tough, director of children\u0027s services, are now writing to the 41 families to apologise for the blunder.Mr Proctor said: \u0027We are truly sorry for the pain and distress caused to the families who were mistakenly sent a schools admissions letter about their child who had sadly passed away.\u0027At the moment, our priority is contacting the families concerned so we can apologise to them directly.\u0027In terms of what happened, as soon as we found out the letters had been sent we launched an investigation through our internal audit department to ensure that such a mistake does not happen again.\u0027This should never have happened in the first place and we offer our most sincere apologies to all the families involved.\u0027Ms Tough added: \u0027I sincerely apologise to anyone who has received this letter in error. I understand how distressing this must be for families who have lost a loved one.Norman Lamb, North Norfolk Liberal Democrat MP, said it was crucial that the council found out what had gone wrong with its systems.He said: \u0027Obviously, my heart goes out to these families. It\u0027s unimaginable how traumatic it must be to be confronted by such a letter amidst their own personal tragedy.\u0027Hollie Nightingale of Stalham, Norfolk, whose daughter Alissia lived just 20 minutes after being born 19 weeks premature, said she was shocked to receive the letter addressed to \u0027the parent or guardian of Alissia Chaplin\u0027.         The letters were erroneously sent (Ms Nightingale who has battled Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since her daughter\u0027s death initially assumed it was a typing error and was about her oldest daughter, Anastasia before she realised it was about her dead baby.She said: \u0027Seeing the letter made me remember I\u0027m not with my child. I\u0027ll never have those birthdays, Christmases, or get that first day at school like I did with my other kids. All I could think was why would they want to remind me of all that?\u0027She reported the incident to the council, speaking to a switchboard operator who apologised, but was unable to help further.Lizzy Jones claims she collapsed on her kitchen floor after receiving the letter about her son Kai Jno Baptiste who was born premature and died six months later of chronic lung disease in April 2016.Miss Jones, 28, of Rockland St Mary, Norfolk, said: \u0027It was awful. I just fell down and couldn\u0027t stop crying. I felt like I hadn\u0027t felt like this since the day that Kai died.\u0027Kai starting school is one of those milestones that I\u0027m never going to have with him.\u0027Miss Jones called to complain and was told that data about children came from NHS records, which were sometimes up to a year out of date.But she said: \u0027Kai has been gone for three-and-a-half years, not a year. The NHS did everything for Kai in his six months.\u0027It was the council I had to go to and register Kai\u0027s death, so how can they not have that information?\u0027Gina Prentice said she and her partner Shaun Horth felt \u0027tormented\u0027 when they received the letter asking them to register their son Kian for a school place.Kian died in their arms when he was just six-days-old after being born prematurely in February 2016 weighing just 888gA problem with his oesophagus meant he was unable to swallow, and he had a heart attack after major surgery to widen his airway.Ms Prentice said: \u0027I am hurt and angry. It reminded me of the milestones we won\u0027t reach.\u0027There was no need for that letter to be sent and achieved nothing but making us who have lost children go through the pain again and again.\u0027How does this happen in 2019, when the people sending the letter are the people who registered his death? They need to sort this system out so nobody else has to go through this heartbreak?\u0027Lisa Weller of Diss, Norfolk, whose daughter Francesca Rose who died of an infection just four hours after being born in September 2015, said: \u0027It\u0027s a painful letter to receive as bereaved parents are already quite aware of all the milestones they miss.Ms Weller said she had also been wrongly sent a letter in 2015 reminding her to register her daughter\u0027s birth.The blunder in Norfolk is similar to one in Manchester last year when nearly 100 letters were sent to bereaved parents. "},{"url":null,"title":"PIERS MORGAN Harry Meghan brought negative press yourselves","story":"Share this article I suspect this staggeringly privileged multi-millionaire prince\u0027s main worry each morning is instructing his servants in his palatial home as to how he wants his breakfast eggs cooked.But when you marry a Hollywood actress, then unfortunately, this kind of pathetic woe-is-me-me-me attitude often comes with the territory.In the next part of his statement, Harry really upped the pity ante, invoking the memory of his late mother Princess Diana.\u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027Wow.I understand why Harry dislikes the press after what happened to his mother, truly I do.Her death must have been incredibly hard for him to take as a 12-year-old boy.But let\u0027s be very clear - the press didn\u0027t kill Diana, a speeding drunk-driver killed Diana.And if she hadn\u0027t recklessly abandoned her usual royal protection officers and drivers, she\u0027d probably still be alive today.         Prince Harry, and Meghan pose with their newborn son Archie on May 8 this year. The Duke of Sussex accused the press of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027relentless propaganda\u0027Yes, she was the subject of huge press attention, but speaking from personal experience as a newspaper editor at the time, I can assure you she played the media game just as ruthlessly as we played it with her.She was the biggest star in the world, and would happily and regularly collude with the papers when it suited her – just as Meghan happily and regularly colludes with magazines like People and Vogue when it suits her.But with all due respect to Ms Markle, she\u0027s not in the same league as Diana in terms of fame.So for Harry to compare them in this way is both wrong and slightly distasteful. (And before the inevitable howls of \u0027you\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s like to lose a parent young\u0027 pour in, let me just point out that my father died when I was very young.)         Meghan was guest editor of September\u0027s Vogue, dedicating it to 15 \u0027fearless women,\u0027 including Jane Fonda, Jacinda Ardern and Greta ThunbergHe added that he has been \u0027witness to her private suffering for too long\u0027 and \u0027to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u0027Hmmm.It was only a few weeks ago that Meghan was telling people at a function that she never reads any press about herself. So how would she know what the press is saying, let alone suffer from it?As I\u0027ve often said, I have little time for Meghan after she ghosted me as a friend the moment she first met Harry. It signified a worrying social-climbing character trait that has seen her ditch many friends and almost all her family if she feels they may threaten her ferociously ambitious rise up the celebrity ladder.But what I think of her personally is irrelevant to the situation that actually sparked this battle with the media, and that is the breakdown of her relationship with her father.There\u0027s no doubt that Thomas Markle made a big mistake in stunting photos with the paparazzi before his daughter\u0027s wedding, as he has admitted himself.But did that really warrant him being banished forever in such a heartless manner?It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that Harry has never met his father-in-law, and that Meghan has now cut him out of her life.         Harry referenced his mother Princess Diana in his statement: \u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027 He is seen above with her and Prince William I\u0027ve interviewed Thomas several times and found him to be a very normal and nice, if naïve, guy who just had no idea how to handle the massive vicarious fame that instantly came his way after Meghan announced she was engaged to a British Prince.Rather then help him, they savagely punished him for a silly mistake, and his erratic behaviour ever since suggests a father deeply hurt and bemused by losing any contact with the daughter he brought up with such love and care.Thomas Markle gave Meghan\u0027s letter to the Mail on Sunday because he wanted to correct what he believed was misleading criticism of him in People magazine from Meghan\u0027s friends.Judge him all you like for it, but imagine how tough the past few years have been for him too? He has never even met his own grandchild.Thomas has been no angel in this family wrangle, but nor is he the devil.And he should be allowed the freedom of speech to defend himself.Rather than going to war with the press in this absurd manner, Harry should clamber down off his hysterical hothead high horse and repair the real running sore causing Meghan\u0027s distress – by making peace with her father. "},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye West drives away NYC churchgoers hijacks Sunday service","story":"Share this article \u0027Instead, West’s Sunday Service had the feel of slaves worshiping on a Southern plantation, praising select scripture that’s been provided in order to keep them in line,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027Greater Allen A.M.E.

Beamline scientist Robert Atwood (left) and particle physicist Jens Dopke examine images of a fragment of Herculaneum scroll, from the beamline end station experimental hutch control room at Diamond Light Source       One of four fragments from the Herculaneum Scrolls which will be key to deciphering the furled scrollsThe four fragments contain many layers and feature visible, exposed writing on the top, which will provide key data needed to develop the next iteration of the team\u0027s \u0027virtual unwrapping\u0027 software pipeline.This is an algorithm that will enable the visualisation of carbon ink.Prof Seales says the use of carbon ink is one of the main reasons these scrolls have evaded deciphering.Unlike metal-based inks, its density is similar to that of the carbonised papyrus on which it sits, and therefore appears invisible in x-rays.Prof Seales said: \u0027We do not expect to immediately see the text from the upcoming scans, but they will provide the crucial building blocks for enabling that visualisation.         A worker at Diamond pours dry ice from a receptacle as he works at Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire\u0027First, we will immediately see the internal structure of the scrolls in more definition than has ever been possible, and we need that level of detail to ferret out the highly compressed layers on which the text sits.\u0027The technology amplifies the ink signal recognising exactly where the ink is using photographs of opened fragments.It can then be used on data from the still-rolled scrolls, identify the hidden ink, and make it more prominently visible to any reader, Prof Seales explained.The I12 beamline or JEEP (Joint Engineering, Environmental, and Processing) beamline, at Diamond is a high energy X-ray beamline for imaging, diffraction and scattering.Dr Thomas Connolley, the principle Beamline scientist, added: \u0027We are very excited to work with the research team, playing our part in what we hope will be a major step forward in unlocking the secrets that the scrolls contain.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"The Making David Hockney","story":"Share this article ‘To celebrate my 85th birthday, next morning I was measured for a suit at Coco Chanel. It is a beautiful fit and of the finest of wool.’Mum wore the suit when she accompanied David to Buckingham Palace to receive his Companion of Honour from the Queen. She could have had champagne but chose tea instead.On another occasion she was given pearls from the Emperor of Japan but they were too heavy to wear on her ageing, thin frame.         Kenneth Hockney, David and John\u0027s father wa a telegraph boy, pictured Visits to meet the famous kept her alive, with something to look forward to. The actor Vincent Price, an avid art collector, was among those who came to Bradford and had tea with her at what she called her ‘humble house’.And in Los Angeles, where David has long had a home, she met stars including Michael Caine, who asked her how she liked Hollywood. Her answer was: ‘Nobody seems to hang their washing out, Michael.’My parents would once only have dreamed of meeting such people and visiting such places, and it seems a pity that Dad, who died in 1977, wasn’t there to share it all too, especially as his philosophy of life did so much to inspire David.Born in Bradford in 1904, Dad grew up in a family open to life as it came. Grandpa Hockney was a former farm labourer who ran a tripe shop and later became a pharmacist’s assistant.For him and my grandmother there was no religion, no regular attendance at church and, unlike my mother’s teetotal parents, both members of the Salvation Army, they partook of alcohol regularly.By the time they finally married in 1903 they already had three children and Dad, who arrived the following year, was the first to be born in wedlock.From his mother, he acquired both the genetic deafness which he has passed on to all of us, and a lovable eccentricity.When unannounced visitors called, Grandma Hockney excused herself, saying ‘I’ll just change my dress’, returning in a new dress pulled over the one she already had on.Dad, who loved Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin, liked wearing a clip-on bow tie to which he affixed brightly coloured stationery dots to add colour to his world.‘Never worry what the neighbours think,’ was his favourite advice and David took it to heart.As an art student in the 1950s he was oblivious to the comments made when, wearing a bowler hat, long red scarf and duffle coat, and spats over his shoes, he transported his canvases and easels around our neighbourhood in an old pram. My brother Paul refused to walk with him, but I loved how he dressed.Proclaiming his homosexuality in 1962, long before the word ‘gay’ was used in that context, David isn’t afraid to stand up for what he thinks is right, as our father did before him.         David Hockney, pictured with his mother Laura, often used his parents as inspiration for his workAs a young man, Dad was persuaded by a friend to attend a talk given by an evangelist preacher. His words moved Dad to accept Jesus that day, and he met my mother when he began helping out with her Sunday School classes at Eastbrook Methodist Mission.After marrying in 1929, they set up home at 61 Steadman Terracea two-bedroom terrace house with an outside lavatory. It stood at the top of a steep hill that was murder to climb while pushing a pram, as my mother soon was, with five children arriving at two-yearly intervals: Paul in 1931, Philip in 1933, Margaret in 1935 and David and I in 1937 and 1939.Dad had been bright enough to go on to further education but, with his older brother Willie away fighting in World War I, creating a void in the family budget, Grandma Hockney had insisted he leave school.His quick mind for figures and handwriting skills soon won him a job as accounts clerk at a large grocery store, sitting on a high stool in a Dickensian one-man office, huddled over a sloping desk and scribing daily figures.We always thought him so important having an office to himself, but his talents were best put to use outside work.Long before high-viz jackets were commonly worn, he made armbands out of orange fluorescent material so he could be seen at night when crossing the road. He was often laughed at but never worried what people thought.Always late for everything, he resorted to wearing two watches, one set fast, but still he was never on time because he forgot which watch was correct.Eventually he decided to wear only one watch and wrote to Fattorini’s, the Bradford jewellers, asking them to set it ‘to gain rather than be accurate’. They refused.This was one of myriad letters he penned. Another was to the local Morrison’s supermarket manager, praising the perforation marks of Izal toilet rolls.‘They always tear to perfection,’ he enthused.         Hockney\u0027s 1957 study of Tunwell Lane, in Eccleshill, pictured, where the family moved in 1943He also corresponded with world leaders on humanitarian matters. In a letter to the Pope, Dad asked him to sell the solid-gold telephone on his bedside table and give the money to the poor of Mexico. And he fought so long and hard against capital punishment that in 1965 he was invited to Parliament to see the act to abolish hanging go through in person.According to David’s fellow students at art college, he talked proudly about that honour and the replies and Christmas cards Dad received from statesmen such as Gandhi, Khrushchev, Nixon and the Archbishop of Canterbury.Dad’s letters often expressed his pacifist views, formed after seeing his brother return from World War I retching and coughing continually from the effects of gas poisoning.After seeing combat in the trenches and mates dying in front of him, Willie was a shell of his old jovial self and from then on my father was an avowed peace campaigner.When World War II broke out, he registered as a conscientious objector. In years to come, David would do the same, completing his National Service by working in hospitals instead of in the Forces.For Dad, the result was that he was tormented verbally and physically by work colleagues and also faced bitterness at home, a neighbour painting the word ‘Coward’ on our wall every night. Every morning, Dad rose early to wash it off before going to work.         In 1977 Hockney completed this work, My Parents, featuring Laura and Kenneth HockneyIn 1943, to avoid further confrontations, we moved to a three- storey house with a cellar at 18 Hutton Terrace, Eccleshill, a village on the outskirts of Bradford. It is now 77 years since David and I began sharing our attic bedroom there, sleeping in two hospital-type beds placed one against each wall. The floral lino was cold on our feet in winter but a couple of grey army blankets kept us warm.Dad’s loving goodnight was complemented with ‘chin pie’, a rub of his stubbly chin on our soft cheeks, and he painted sunrises on the doors to brighten our lives during the long summer evenings when a blackout curtain blocked the light from outside.OF course, back then, I had no perception that David was to become one of the greatest artists of the 21st century. To satisfy his need to draw during wartime, when paper was unaffordable at least for our family, he woke first, quietly creeping downstairs and drawing on the white edge of Dad’s newspaper, Mum’s magazine or whatever else arrived that day.For family members, there was gentle irritation that their newspaper or comic had been interfered with, and once read it was thrown away or used to light the fire — complete with David’s sketches.Eager to draw at any time, he carried a pencil in his pocket when we went to chapel and used the blank pages at the back and front of hymn books to draw on.When he won a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School in 1948, he had to wear a second-hand blazer, the Hockneys’ financial situation having become disastrous when, soon after VE Day, Dad was fired for his pacifist beliefs. These had been tolerated only while he was needed and he no longer was, made surplus to requirements by returning soldiers needing jobs, and the invention of the mechanical calculator.To make ends meet, Dad had begun refurbishing babies’ prams and making new dolls’ prams, and as we had no home telephone, the advertisements he placed in the local newspaper required interested clients to ring a local phone box between 9am and 11am on Saturdays.Each week, Dad heaved an armchair onto his back, carried it up to the phone box and sat outside waiting for calls, nonchalantly reading the newspaper and directing any approaching member of the public to the next box a short way away.Each of the prams featured decorative lines painted by Dad with a long sable brush, and David was mesmerised by how straight they were and how, with a twist of his hand, Dad created a perfect serif.At the grammar school, art, being regarded as purely recreational, was restricted to one-and-a-half hours a week.Promising students were forced to drop it altogether, so David deliberately failed academic subjects, once refusing to hand in an essay as his English homework and vowing not to waste time on sports.He allegedly won a cross-country race, to general surprise, but was disqualified when a master travelling on a bus spotted him riding a bicycle part of the way. He wasn’t ashamed, his opposition to sport giving him more time to draw.Only in his final year at school did David begin intense study of English, History and other subjects. This stood him in good stead for his transfer to Bradford College of Art — and while there he found an early critic in my father, whose portrait he wanted to submit to an exhibition in Leeds.During the sitting, Dad had positioned a mirror so he could see what David was painting and he commented on his choice of colours as he went along. ‘I don’t think that’s right, not for the cheeks,’ he would say, but David assured him it was how they were taught at art school and he was vindicated when, on the first day of the exhibition, My Father sold for £10 — a fortnight’s wages for its subject.Later awarded the rare distinction of a gold medal at the Royal College of Art, he was soon regarded as someone to watch, getting his first one-man show in 1963. That was at a gallery in London which promised him sales of £600 a year, twice what our father earned, but David has never pursued wealth for wealth’s sake. He pursues art and only a selfish person can be so devoted to it.By ‘selfish’ I mean that for David to achieve what he needs to explore at any given time, he must nurture every minute in that pursuit. Nothing else matters.On a visit to America in 1964 he bought a second-hand Ford Falcon convertible in New York, filled it with petrol and drove to California.He loved the sunshine, swimming pools, minimal clothing and warm, balmy days. With light and a brightness that made colours vibrate, California was the exact opposite of Bradford’s overcast gloom and an ecstatic David had soon bought a house in the Hollywood Hills.The first time I visited him there, he took our mother and me to Christmas lunch at the home of director John Schlesinger, and we shared New Year with actordirector Tony Richardson and his daughter Natasha.On subsequent visits, singer Tony Bennett and his daughter Antonia joined us for Christmas Day at David’s beach house in Malibu. But although he knew exciting people, I sensed a sadness in his invitations to join him for Christmas in LA in the late Seventies and early Eighties.‘I wish my arms stretched to Los Angeles, you need a hug,’ I would say, knowing he was sometimes lonely.Although he still had homes in both LA and London, the 1990s found him spending increasing amounts of time in the seaside town of Bridlington, Yorkshire, where our mother had moved to live with our sister Margaret.Margaret had a large house across from the promenade and David would drive from London to visit them.Each visit he would stay a bit longer, and after Mum’s death in 1999 he moved into Margaret’s house and she moved to a small bungalow near by.In December 2012 I rang from my home in Australia to wish him Happy Christmas and realised I couldn’t make out what he was saying. As he had been teetotal since having a heart attack in 1990, I knew he wasn’t drunk so I emailed Margaret to ask if he was well. She told me he’d had a stroke in November and she wasn’t to tell anyone.I flew back to see for myself. By the time I arrived, David had begun drawing again.It was a blessing. He has always said that life will be finished for him if he cannot use his hands, and he’ll no doubt be drawing and painting until his final day.

Her love of cartoon fantasy figures led her to Barbarella, as portrayed by Jane Fonda in the Roger Vadim film, though her biggest influence was Marilyn Monroe, who she recognised “was playing a character, the proverbial dumb blonde with the little-girl voice and the big-girl body … a woman playing a man’s idea of a woman”. As the only woman in an all-male band, Harry knew she had to make her mark. With her peroxide hair, thrift-store clothes and expression that sat somewhere between a pout and a sneer, she was a pin-up with a subversive streak: “My Blondie character was an inflatable doll but with a dark, provocative, aggressive side. I was playing it up yet I was very serious.”In Face It, Harry, who is now 74, outlines the influences and events that led to her rise to fame. Written with the music writer Sylvie Simmons, the memoir is based on a series of lengthy interviews, which makes for a conversational style, though anyone looking for an excavation of the soul might be disappointed. Harry has rock ’n’ roll stories to burn but the memoir as a confessional isn’t her style. For the most part, the Blondie character remains.The music, which merged punk rock with pop sensibilities, is only part of the picture having been awarded the title “best-looking girl” in her school yearbook, Harry knew the value of her attractiveness early on, and later created an industry around her image. It was she, for instance, who saw an upturned car on a New York street and, rather than moving on, declared it ideal for a photoshoot. Before designers were lining up to work with her, she would find a pillowcase and turn it into a stage outfit later, years before Lady Gaga’s meat dress, she would step out in a gown made of razorblades. Harry was driven not by a quest for fame but for creativity. “Ultimately for me,” she notes, “it’s the overwhelming need to have my entire life be an imaginative out-of-body experience.”We learn how, having been given up for adoption at three months old, Harry was raised by her adoptive parents in New Jersey. Before Blondie took off, she worked variously as a model, a secretary at the BBC’s New York office, a waitress and a Playboy bunny, all the while trying to figure out her next move. When she first moved to New York, she wanted to be a painter but, after seeing the likes of Janis Joplin, the Velvet Underground and, later, the New York Dolls, she decided music was her calling. Harry joined and left various bands including the Stilettos, through which she met Chris Stein, who would become her principal collaborator as the guitarist in Blondie, her partner for the next 13 years and, after their split, one of her dearest friends.Early on, Harry offers a vivid portrait of a seedy, bohemian scene in late-60s New York in which drugs were “part of your social life, part of the creative process, chic and fun and really just there. No one thought about the consequences.” Describing her first encounter with heroin with her then-boyfriend, she recalls: “It was so delicious and delightful … For those times when I wanted to blank out parts of my life or when I was dealing with some depression, there was nothing better than heroin. Nothing.”A similar matter-of-factness runs through her recollections of the man who approached her and Stein one night outside their front door and threatened them with a knife. When they said they didn’t have any money, he insisted on accompanying them into their apartment. There he tied up Stein and Harry while he piled up their guitars and amps by the front door. He then untied Harry and raped her. “I can’t say that I felt a lot of fear,” she recalls. “I’m very glad this happened pre-Aids or I might have freaked. In the end, the stolen guitars hurt me more than the rape.”Her account of the incident indicates the somewhat detached tone of this memoir. Whether reflecting on her fruitless search for her birth parents, or the New Jersey ex-boyfriend who stalked her and threatened her with a gun, or the close shave with a man who offered her a lift, and whom she believes to have been the serial killer Ted Bundy, Harry allows no room for shock, sadness or vulnerability. This is, of course, the author’s prerogative and doesn’t mean that the book is without depth or charm. She can be caustic and funny, and is drily unfazed by the antics of her mostly male peers. While on tour with Iggy Pop and David Bowie, the latter flashes his penis at Harry in the dressing room “as if I were the official cock checker or something”. Noting Bowie’s generously proportioned appendage, she is moved to wonder “why Iggy didn’t let me have a closer look at his dick”.By the early 1980s, band relations were fraught. A last-minute tour cancellation because of Stein’s ill health (he was later diagnosed with a rare auto-immune disease) was the final straw and Blondie fell apart. Shortly afterwards, they discovered they had accrued two years’ worth of unpaid taxes, prompting Harry to lose her house, her car and even some of her clothes. Swallowing her fury, and having nursed Stein back to health, she got back to work.Inevitably, Harry’s tales of her solo ventures and Blondie’s eventual reunion lack the atmosphere and excitement of the early years, and it’s with more than a little awkwardness that she shoehorns in details of her current day-to-day life to spice things up. “Could my routines reveal further insight into what makes me tick?” she asks, treating us to her morning schedule of letting the dogs out and making coffee, to which the answer is: no.But when not resorting to padding, Face It makes for an engaging and occasionally surprising read. It’s a shame that Harry passes up the chance to dig deeper into her experiences of objectification and the nature of fame, but more disappointing is that we learn so little about her interior life, and how she really thinks and feels. Perhaps that’s to be expected from a notoriously private star with such an acute understanding of image. Rather than expose her inner workings to the world, Harry has determined to stay mysterious to the last.• Face It by Debbie Harry is published by HarperCollins (RRP £20) To order a copy go to bookshop or call 020-3176 3837.

Summers, who is not known for cultural or political nuance, reported that he had been on holiday across the US. Not only that, but he’d gone by car. This pioneering spirit yielded such insights as that the centre of the country is sparsely populated and surprisingly oblivious to events on the east and west coasts. Summers was a changed man.Why had this latter-day Jack Kerouac not understood his own country before? Summers explained that “economists like me see the world through the prism of models”. And yet the literature seeking to uncover the hidden middle America has been growing for some years now, even before Donald Trump’s election provoked panic on the part of elites. From Thomas Frank’s prescient What’s the Matter With Kansas? (2004) through George Packer’s The Unwinding (2013), to Arlie Russell Hochschild’s Strangers in Their Own Land and the meritocratic sneer of JD Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy (both 2016), plus the heartbreaking photo journalism of Chris Arnade, the fragmentation and private tragedies of middle America have received plenty of reportage and reflection. The question is whether figures such as Summers have been paying any attention.This genre is not so developed in the UK, perhaps because a nation smaller than California doesn’t require it as urgently. Nevertheless, the shocks of the past three years have provoked overdue curiosity about precarious employment, the housing crisis and the cultural margins, which are rarely dramatic enough to attract media or political attention. It’s not just Brexit: between spring 2017 and spring 2018, Britain also witnessed Theresa May being confronted by the hard truth of austerity, Corbyn’s electoral surge, the horror of the Grenfell tragedy, and the appalling details of the Windrush scandal. If complacency with the fairness and contentment of the country was still possible in May 2016, within two years it surely was not.Jack Shenker’s Now We Have Your Attention is an exploration of a nation in distress, touching on many of the key fractures that have opened in British society since the financial crisis of 2008. Each of the book’s seven chapters considers a particular theme, via a particular place: the devastation wrought by austerity on vulnerable young people in Manchester, the disruption to traditional communities in Tilbury, the spectre of automation in Newcastle, and so on.Grenfell, Yarl’s Wood detention centre and other grimly familiar names are encountered along the way. But so are the energy and vision of activists seeking to build something different. Shenker introduces us to the Unity Centre in Glasgow, which offers support to those targeted by Home Office border enforcement, and the London Renters Union, which campaigns against the dominance of landlords. The one constant theme through the book is conflict. “The defining feature of our age is that politics is being reanimated, drawing an era of mass, passive spectatorship to a close.” People are suffering, but they’re also struggling, and therein lies hope.Shenker is a journalist, and each of these portraits is skilfully compiled through the first-hand stories of the protagonists. These are told with great sensitivity and empathy, resulting in tales of injustice and loss that can be deeply moving. We meet Theo, a victim of the “hostile environment” policy that was responsible for the Windrush nightmare, and Kyle, a young man from Oldham who ended up on the streets via a series of family tragedies. Shenker is eager to avoid justifying any drift towards nationalism, but is nevertheless attentive to the conditions that might prompt it. “Without thinking about who has more reason to be nostalgic,” he argues “and what it is those people are nostalgic for, accusations of nostalgia risk becoming little more than a ‘mute’ button on those who have lost the most.”Capitalism, neoliberalism and discredited ideology haunt this portrait of Britain, and Shenker is quick to draw on sociological and statistical analysis, to provide context for the personal stories he recounts. The American sociologist C Wright Mills famously defined the “sociological imagination” as that which helps to connect “personal troubles” to “public issues”. Now We Have Your Attention has such imagination in abundance.A difficulty I had with the book derived from its curiously brief prologue it never entirely left me as I was reading. Shenker is reticent about the premise of his study, noting that our “weird, disorientating age” is “marked by political earthquakes and volcanoes – shock election results, constitutional chaos, new parties, new leaders, new governments” but this handwaving fails to explain what really concerns him. In any case, the book is not about Brexit (no bad thing right now), and nor does it cast much light on the isions behind that crisis.He then contrasts his book with the “sped-up”, “free-floating” and “ahistorical” takes of “most news coverage”. No doubt he is right that there’s too much sensationalist and drive-by reportage in the British media, from which he correctly and deservedly distinguishes himself. But not being part of the “mainstream media” is something that virtually anyone can aspire to, and on social media they frequently do. It doesn’t indicate what we should be talking about instead, or why. The number of stories not reported by the mainstream media is effectively infinite.Without a sense of what’s driving him, the writing sometimes takes on the feel of psychogeography, moving through time and space, identifying connections and giving voice to the marginalised and forgotten. Of the American titles listed, The Unwinding is the closest comparison. Shenker is an excellent guide and an elegant writer. But I wanted to ask: why did you go there? How did you select that?Over the course of Now We Have Your Attention, one detects answers. While Shenker never says as much, the book is plainly written from the left, which isn’t to say that it is aimed at the left. A chapter on Corbynism, Momentum and The World Transformed conference – taking us from a three-day hackathon in Brighton to Jeremy Corbyn’s Westminster office – is palpably excited by these movements. In his choice of informants, we get a sense of what drives him. All are victims of or campaigning against social and economic injustice. Most could be described as on the left, in some sense or other.Gathering these voices together is an entirely valid project, indeed an urgent one now that the 2017-18 window (when Britain’s gravest injustices seemed to dominate the news cycle) seems to be closing, to be replaced by culture war and constitutional crisis. The problem for many of the activists and movements presented by Shenker is that they did to some degree have the nation’s attention, but are losing it all over again, as Brexit devours everything. The worry in 2019 is that bogus conflicts, rooted in lies and scapegoats, are stealing our attention from the real ones that Shenker traces. If our political elites had shown some of his curiosity towards everyday struggles across Britain, and some of his compassion towards the strugglers, we wouldn’t have reached this pass in the first place.• Now We Have Your Attention by Jack Shenker is published by Bodley Head (£16.99).

It had been, he wrote, “a year of publick wonder and mischief to this nation, and, therefore, generally wished by all people to have an end”.Not everything was gloomy, however – he had, he noted, “come to abounde in good plate”, meaning that instead of using more humble pewter, “all entertainments” in the Pepys household could now be served entirely on silver plates.More than 350 years later, a rare example of one of Pepys’ silver plates has been discovered, one of just three plates known to survive from his own collection and the only one on display in the UK.Despite being marked with his own coat of arms, the trencher plate has only been recently been identified as belonging to Pepys, according to the Museum of London, where it is now on display in its War, Plague and Fire gallery.It was made in the workshop of Mary King in Foster Lane in 1681, and displays visible knife and fork scratch marks, suggesting it was well used by the diarist and naval administrator.Pepys began his diary in 1660, at the age of 26, and wrote in it for almost a decade, during which he described some of the most momentous events in London’s history, including the coronation of King Charles II, the great plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London the following year. He went on to become an MP in Norfolk in 1673 and for Harwich in 1679, and died in 1703, at the age of 70.Hazel Forsyth, senior curator of medieval and post-medieval at the Museum of London, said: “This is a very important object as it is exceptionally rare to be able to identify the maker and the owner of a plate from this period.“The fact that it belonged to Samuel Pepys, one of the most celebrated figures in literary and English history, makes it even more special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5b02b1b8a5fe0995793e901d9f35dc8d581b8d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b85a16742e9fa470d6ca40610596d8ac","title":"energy network firms allowed to make bigger than expected profits ofgem admits","story":"Companies that run UK’s energy pipes and wires earning double-digit returns, says OfgemThe regulator has allowed energy network companies to make bigger than expected profits at the expense of household bills, according to its own state of the market report.Ofgem admitted the companies that run Britain’s energy pipes and wires had earned double-digit returns in the last year despite its efforts to keep a lid on energy bills.The regulator oversees the business plans of regional gas and electricity networks to keep a rein on how much each firms can spend on their infrastructure, and how much they can claim back through energy bills.It said that with hindsight it had set the rate of return too high, and that some companies had managed to spend less than planned, to rake in higher profits.The uncomfortable evaluation has emerged following Ofgem’s decision to appoint its head of networks as its new chief executive. Jonathan Brearley will replace Dermot Nolan when he steps down in February next year.It said: “The overall costs to consumers of the transmission and distribution networks have turned out to be higher than they needed to be.”The admission is likely to anger critics, including UK Power Networks and National Grid, who have warned that networks are hiking up household energy bills while paying bumper shareholder payouts to foreign investors.It could also embolden the Labour party’s nationalisation agenda which includes a pledge to bring the networks back under public control to end “rip-off” energy bills.Dr Alan Whitehead, the shadow minister for energy and climate change, said: “When it comes to the excess profits of network companies, Ofgem were asleep at the wheel. Their payment framework forces them to try and predict the future, years in advance, which was easily gamed and exploited by some network companies. Labour would scrap this senseless system by bringing energy networks back into public ownership to be run democratically, for the public good, and without ripping off bill payers.”David Smith, the chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, said the cost of Britain’s energy pipes and wires “are almost a fifth lower than they were at the time of privatisation in 1990” – and would fall further.He said: “The energy networks have delivered for the bill payer while playing an integral role in the move to a low-carbon economy. The way we deliver energy has never been more reliable, backed by record levels of investment.”However, the regulator’s renewed concern over network company profits has emerged as the companies face scrutiny over their role in the August blackouts which left 1m homes without electricity, including a hospital and Newcastle airport.Ofgem said its decision to encourage more players into the market had helped to increase competition and switching rates. But it admitted this strategy had led to a five-fold increase in the number of customer complaints to the energy ombudsman because many small suppliers are not financially stable enough to provide adequate service.The ombudsman accepted more than 100 complaints for every 100,000 customers of small suppliers in the first quarter of this year, compared with about 20 cases in the first quarter of 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season.

Temperatures are rising. The consequences for oceans, forests, weather patterns, bioersity, food production, water, jobs and, ultimately, lives, are already dire – and set to get much worse.The science is undeniable. But in many places, people don’t need a chart or graph to understand the climate crisis. They can simply look out the window.Climate chaos is playing out in real time from California to the Caribbean, and from Africa to the Arctic and beyond. Those who contributed least to the problem are suffering the most.I have seen it with my own eyes from cyclone-battered Mozambique to the hurricane-devastated Bahamas to the rising seas of the South Pacific.I called on the climate action summit to serve as a springboard to set us on the right path ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines established by the Paris agreement on climate change. And many leaders – from many countries and sectors – stepped up.A broad coalition – not just governments and youth, but businesses, cities, investors and civil society – came together to move in the direction our world so desperately needs to avert climate catastrophe.More than 70 countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, even if major emitters have not yet done so. More than 100 cities did the same, including several of the world’s largest.At least 70 countries announced their intention to boost their national plans under the Paris agreement by 2020.Countries from Pakistan to Guatemala, Colombia to Nigeria, New Zealand to Barbados vowed to plant more than 11bn trees.More than 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating their move into the green economy.A group of the world’s largest asset-owners – responsible for directing more than $2tn – pledged to move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050.This is in addition to a recent call by asset managers representing nearly half the world’s invested capital – some $34tn – for global leaders to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide.The International Development Finance Club pledged to mobilize $1tn in clean energy funding by 2025 in 20 least developed countries.One-third of the global banking sector signed up to align their businesses with the Paris agreement objectives and sustainable development goals.The summit also showcased ways in which cities and global industries like shipping can achieve major reductions in emissions. Initiatives to protect forests and safeguard water supplies were also highlighted.These steps are all important – but they are not sufficient.From the beginning, the summit was designed to jolt the world and accelerate action on a wider scale. It also served as a global stage for hard truths and to shine a light on those who are leading and those who are not. Deniers or major emitters have nowhere to hide.I will continue to encourage them to do much more at home and drive green economic solutions around the world.Our planet needs action on a truly planetary scale. That cannot be achieved overnight, and it cannot happen without the full engagement of those contributing most to the crisis.Too many countries still seem to be addicted to coal – even though cheaper, greener options are available already. We need much more progress on carbon pricing, ensuring no new coal plants by 2020, and ending trillions of dollars in giveaways of hard-earned taxpayers’ money to a dying fossil fuel industry to boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases and heighten conflict.At the same time, developed countries must fulfill their commitment to provide $100bn a year from public and private sources by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.And I will make sure that the commitments that countries, the private sector and local authorities have made are accounted for – starting in December at the UN climate conference in Santiago, Chile. The UN is united in support of realizing these initiatives.Climate change is the defining issue of our time.Science tells us that on our current path, we face at least 3C of global heating by the end of the century.

It’s a dilemma we face more often, as universities and public institutions critically examine their histories, reassessing the past with 21st-century eyes. And over the last year, University College London has been in the midst of a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics – the debunked “science” that claimed that by selectively breeding humans we could improve racial quality.We tend to associate eugenics with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, but it was in fact developed in London. Its founder was Francis Galton, who established a laboratory at UCL in 1904. Already, some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre.Galton’s seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent, productive people. The scientists in its thrall claimed this could be achieved by controlling reproduction, policing borders to prevent certain types of immigrants, and locking away “undesirables”, including disabled people.In hindsight, it’s easy to say that only a moral abyss could have given rise to such a pseudo-scientific plan, not least because we have borne witness to its horrifying consequences through the 20th century, when it was used to justify genocide and mass sterilisations. And by the standards of today, Galton does resemble a monster. He was a brilliant statistician but also a racist (not just my assessment, but that of Veronica van Heyningen, the current president of the Galton Institute). He was obsessed with human difference, and determined to remove from British society those he considered inferior.Yet as our critical gaze falls on Galton, are we losing sight of just how popular his idea was among so many Britons? In the early 20th century, a surprisingly broad roster of public figures aligned themselves with Galton’s vision. It attracted people on the left and right, prominent writers and intellectuals, leading scientists and politicians. Virginia Woolf, TS Eliot, DH Lawrence, Julian Huxley, Winston Churchill, Marie Stopes – all held eugenic views. Churchill was vice-president of the first International Eugenics Conference, held in London in 1912. Although there were notable critics, to be a eugenicist was to be firmly in the mainstream.This was an age in which it was not unusual for scientists to believe that humans were ided into different species, some more advanced than others. Biologists proclaimed that it would be better for society if disabled and “mentally feeble” people hadn’t been born. Eugenics made it into government policy: the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913 institutionally separated those whom the state considered “mentally feeble” or “morally defective” from the rest of society, effectively preventing them from having children.From our 21st-century vantage point, what do we do with this knowledge? Whom do we keep and whom do we condemn? The moral boundaries may feel clear. A eugenicist is a eugenicist. A racist is a racist. But if Galton is out, where does that leave everyone else? The guilty party isn’t merely Galton, or even eugenic ideology – it’s also the age in which he lived. The sad saga of eugenics teaches us not only that scientists can be wrong, but that the promise of a better, brighter future at the cost of innocent inidual lives can be all too tempting to many. Teamed with the prejudices of the time, it can be devastating.Primo Levi, corresponding with a German scientist he had worked under while imprisoned in Auschwitz decades earlier, wrote that he couldn’t accept the man’s plea that he hadn’t known what was happening around him. To cast Galton as the evil figure pushing eugenics may be to overlook the bigger truth that thousands were freely buying into his flawed theories, and that Britain was remarkably receptive to them. Too many happily ignored, and some even enthusiastically embraced, the implications of his plans – namely, that they might require innocent people to make sacrifices against their wishes.Tempting as it is to single out Galton for condemnation, that instinct should be tempered by the sober understanding that the slope that sends society towards moral shame is built by many. We must remember Galton as who he really was, and see him in full glare with nothing erased. But iding the world into good guys and bad guys allows us to wash our hands of moral complexity. The danger lies not just with the bad guys but with every one of us, and it is always there.•Angela Saini is a science journalist and author.

A new website aims to teach them about coercive controlDomestic abuse is normally associated with women cowering on the floor, as a violent husband waits to strike, or mothers covering up their black eyes with concealer before the school run. On the same day that the domestic abuse bill received its second reading in parliament, Age UK called for action to tackle domestic abuse of over-60s, whose needs it says are often overlooked by the law, policy and practice. The needs of teenagers in the heady throes of first love who are in emotionally abusive relationships also need to be recognised.Common themes of such relationships include (though are not limited to) excessive jealousy, repeated criticism and sexual coercion. If your boyfriend or girlfriend is checking your phone, constantly asking to know your whereabouts, getting upset when you spend time away, turning up unannounced to surprise you, these are all examples of coercive control. If they never apologise in an argument and make everything your fault, tell you what you can and can’t wear, undermine you andor publicly humiliate you under the guise of a “joke”, these again are common instances of controlling behaviour. Ditto, if they have a JekyllHyde personality, make you feel like you are walking on eggshells even when things are seemingly going well, and threaten to hurt themselves if you leave. When it comes to sexual coercion and rape, examples include making you feel pressured to perform sexual acts you’re uncomfortable with, such as sending nude photos, having sex before you’re ready, being pressured to re-enact extreme sex from porn films or being told you don’t love them if you say no.Often the victim in an abusive relationship can never quite put their finger on one thing, but the overwhelming feeling is of a general unease, feeling unsafe, defective, wrong, scared and as if you are going crazy. It’s your “yourselfness” that’s being consistently undermined, controlled and attacked by the person who claims to love you.“But he never hit me,” is the phrase that comes up repeatedly when talking to teenage victims of emotionally abusive relationships. Another is: “It’s my fault. I’m so crazy. I’m the one who’s impossible, not him.” Or: “Isn’t that just what relationships are like?” Yet emotional abuse and coercive control are abuse, even if the perpetrator never physically hurts their victim.Unfortunately, discussions around abuse are almost as toxic as abuse itself, with society offering very mixed messages about what is and isn’t acceptable. Victories in the campaign to seriously tackle psychological violence against women often feel like one step forward and two back. Coercive control became illegal in 2015, but the majority of cases are dropped without charge. The MeToo movement may have empowered many victims to share their stories of sexual violence, but rape conviction rates have plummeted to such lows that it feels as if it has been practically decriminalised. Popular culture does little to help combat poisonous and confusing messages. In fact, it consistently perpetuates male-on-female abuse as aspirational love stories. Romances currently on Netflix include Noah threatening to kill himself to get a date in The Notebook, Edward repeatedly stalking Bella in Twilight, and even in Friends, “lovable” Ross repeatedly showing excessive jealousy and ownership of Rachel. All of these abusive behaviours are seen as gestures of love, and rewarded with the couple reaching “happily ever after” – rather than the more likely option of the woman suffering long-term psychological trauma. And psychological abuse can be extremely hard to recover from.All this may make it seem as if tackling relationship abuse is insurmountable, but education is key. That is why Women’s Aid has launched the website Love Respect as a vital resource for young people. We are rarely more vulnerable than when we are in love – particularly when we are in love for the first time. Educating young people on abusive behaviours in a relationship isn’t “the death of romance” – it’s about making everyone realise that abuse was never romantic to begin with.•Holly Bourne is an author of young adult fiction and ambassador for Love Respect.

Rivalling New York City and LA, Toronto’s become a new premier destination for millennials curious to discover its thriving arts, culture, fashion and dining scenes.After taking in some of the top-tier downtown attractions, such as the CN Tower, head over to nearby Kensington Market. Spanning only a few blocks, the streets lined with outdoor fruit markets, musicians and local craft boutiques are emblematic of Toronto’s erse spirit.From Mexican to Japanese food, the market is a culinary beast. It’s home to Toronto’s best-rated taco shop, Seven Lives, where you can snatch a spot in line and grab a combo of three fish, octopus or shrimp tacos for less than £10. Wash it down at El Rey, a mezcal bar with an Americana western vibe, where a shot and brew go for less than £8. Finally, for a spot of fine dining, look no further than acclaimed chef Jen Agg’s Grey Gardens, where you can enjoy wine and oysters in an exquisite French-bistro setting.Kensington Market is also a treasure trove of vintage finds. So whether you’re looking for a bossy fur coat or a 90s Nike tracksuit, get thrifting! Mixed into the vintage crawl are local designer clothing and jewellery stores that offer a personalised touch at a reasonable price. One of these most notable mainstays is Sole Survivor – an all-female shoe and leather repairs shop, owned by Lorena Agolli. The caring neighbourhood spirit of the city comes alive in the shop, with the craft perfected in patience and care.‘I would say to come and visit with an open mind and to avoid just visiting the standard tourist attractions. Instead, try and get lost in the more erse and culturally immersive areas in the city, like Kensington Market.’ Lorena Agolli, Sole Survivor ownerMore or less everyone in Toronto can agree that Riverdale and the adjacent neighbourhood of Leslieville are having a moment. While most of this guide features hotspots in the west end, the sweeping views of the skyline and flourishing culinary scene puts this east end spot on the map.Toronto’s appetite for brunch is huge – and its menus reflect the city’s status as one of the most erse in the world, fusing cultures, ingredients and techniques from across the globe. Leslieville knows its way around a brunch better than pretty much anywhere else in Toronto. Lady Marmalade, a long-time local gem for all-day breakfast, has featured in the top 10 eggs benedict in the city since it opened in 2005. Mixing traditional and Mexican-inspired dishes, the bright, airy space combines local hospitality with a touch of elegance.For lunch, the Real Jerk, which was the filming location for Drake and Rihanna’s music video for Work, is a family-run, unassuming spot for some of the city’s best West Indian cuisine. Finally, Ascari Enoteca, named after 1950s Italian racing legend Alberto Ascari, is a Leslieville favourite. Serving up plates of handmade pasta paired with perfect wine matches, it’s known as the date-night spot by neighbourhood denizens.If you’re heading back to the area for some fun after dark, the hottest spot at the moment is the Rooftop Bar at the Broadview Hotel. Housed in a historic building dating back to 1891, this newly renovated space, featuring industrial chic decorative touches, offers unmatched views of the city skyline. Another hotspot is the Vatican Gift Shop, where patrons step through a secret door, in what from the outside appears to be an unassuming storefront, into a neon-lit basement speakeasy to enjoy live music and a cocktail (or two).Get artsy on Queen Street West. From its independent galleries and hip bars to high-end boutiques, this street, which stretches from Roncesvalles to central Toronto, is an urban trekker’s dream. Get those cameras out – you won’t want to miss a photo-op next to the many murals that  Queen Street West. Don’t be surprised if you wander into one of the many galleries and get handed a complementary glass of wine at an exhibition opening if you’re around in the early evening.Local creatives flock to Queen Street West to share their crafts – so store-hopping is a must. Find your new favourite vintage rock T-shirt from F as in Frank. Or what about bespoke lipstick, fused together right before your eyes at Bite Beauty Lab? If simplicity with a conscience is your thing, check out KOTN, a homegrown clothing label committed to quality essentials, ethically made, and honestly priced. Owner Ben Sehl’s store, bordering popular Trinity Bellwoods Park, is a reflection of the city’s bubbling creativity.‘The balance makes Toronto such a great city, and the ersity keeps it interesting – there’s always something new to discover.’ Ben Sehl, owner of KOTNNeed to fuel up from all that wandering? A quick grab-and-go prosciutto sandwich from Forno Cultura is a great option for those on the run. Or take a break at Terroni, a hometown casual eatery with simple and delicious Italian fare, paired with an exclusive list of wines from Italy. For a snack, feed your pastry and caffeine cravings at award-winning Sam James Coffee Bar across from Trinity Bellwoods Park. For an exquisite, once-in-a-lifetime experience, Alo, which has topped Canada’s 100 best restaurants list three years in a row, combines French cuisine with local seasonal ingredients for an eye-opening culinary experience.Finally, when dusk falls, romantic cocktail bars and hideaways come to life on Queen West. For the crowd, head to the Drake Hotel, where parties are held across three levels (basement to rooftop bar) each weekend. For something less flashy, a 10-minute walk north to Dundas Street West brings you to Cocktail Bar, where delicious cocktails meet refined snacks. Finally, bring your A-game to Apartment 200 — perhaps the city’s trendiest bar, where Toronto’s top DJs go for a spin.Toronto has one of the world’s biggest Chinatowns, so it’s no surprise that it’s a fixture of the city. Chinatown is a fine option for planning a day excursion filled with activities. Start off with selfies at the Art Gallery of Ontario, especially with the world-acclaimed Yayoi Kusama Infinity Mirrors installation. Then, prepare yourself for a food adventure.For an authentic dim sum experience, order your har gow and siu mai off the menu at Rol San Restaurant. Need a quick fix? Swatow offers cheap and plentiful food – order the signature wonton noodle soup or Yeung Chow fried rice (note: These portions are huge.) For a snack, Juicy Dumpling is the easy option – where six soup dumplings start at less than £1.In recent times, the area has also become a hub for street style with world-class stores sprawled along Spadina Avenue. Check out Nomad Toronto, carrying everything from Issey Miyake and Comme des Garcons to the self-styled “internet street apparel” available at local hang Creeps, which is run by an all-female cast. Around the corner is Better Gift Shop. Owned by Avi Gold, who has collaborated with big-time retailers such as Dover Street Market, it offers a collection of unique international brands and local wears, catering for all your unique souvenir needs.‘An impressively wide range of ersity in cuisine and quality at a fair price defines Toronto’s food scene. There are many high-end, world-class establishments, as well as accessible spots that a visitor could enjoy and find affordable.’ Sam James, owner of Sam James Coffee BarDespite being known as a foodie’s paradise, Chinatown is the ultimate spontaneous night out. Enjoy a lychee cocktail underneath the glowing lanterns at Big Trouble in Little China, named after the 1986 fantasy martial arts film. Then, if you’re gutsy enough, head to B Boss KTV to belt it all out. Whether it’s Ed Sheeran, Spice Girls, or Mariah Carey, the private karaoke has a great collection of songs and fun disco lighting.Ready to explore Toronto?

Meanwhile, climate chaos and the scourge of plastic are only adding to the oceans’ problems.Four out of five people agree we should only eat fish that has come from sustainable sources. There is no reliable estimate for how much of the fish sold in the UK is from sustainable sources, but evidence suggests it may be a minority of the seafood we eat.For shoppers looking to eat ethically, judging what fish meets that bill can be tricky, with a plethora of guidelines, coalitions and voluntary codes of practice, and labels that refer to sustainable farming or line-caught methods in place of standard nets.“Don’t be taken in by generic claims about fish being ‘responsible’ or ‘sustainable’,” advises Ruth Westcott, the campaign co-ordinator at the NGO Sustainable Fish Cities. “Look for those on the Marine Conservation Society fish to eat list, or that carry a Marine Stewardship Council, or Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), or the organic symbol.”The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) publishes a regularly updated Good Fish Guide that lists edible fish species using a traffic light and 1 to 5 five numbering system, where a red (5) means avoid altogether and green (1 to 2) means stocks are sustainable, while amber (3 and 4) indicates potential problems: 3 for stocks that are passable but require improvement, and 4 meaning seek alternatives.The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) awards fisheries sustainable status, represented by a blue tick logo on the label, based on an examination of their stocks, the fishing practices employed and the traceability of the wild fish. To gain certification, fisheries must submit to (and pay for) an independent audit. About a third of all UK sales of seafood through retailers bear the MSC blue tick, representing about £1bn a year in the shops.Some experts say that rating species and fisheries as the MCS does can be too generic, as the rating covers a whole area but within that region some vessels may be operating in a much more sustainable manner than others, for instance by avoiding damaging methods such as trawling. For the UK, there is also often a lack of key data, giving some species an automatic low score.The MSC rating system has its problems too – for instance, consumers were told in 2017 that cod from the North Sea (which accounts for only a small amount of the cod sold in the UK but has a high status with consumers) was once again sustainable. Hopes for cod recovery were then quickly dashed when stocks were found this summer to have plummeted, taking the fish firmly off the sustainable menu.There have also been complaints about certified fisheries subsequently breaching the rules, so they need to be continuously monitored.Many offer wild fish with the blue tick or responsibly farmed fish with the ASC or organic symbol (and the  aims to only publish recipes for fish rated 1-2 by the MCS). Most of the UK’s big retailers are signed up to the Sustainable Seafood Coalition (SSC) which issues voluntary codes of conduct, championed by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and overseen by the NGO Client Earth.However, take care: the SSC codes allow some latitude. The BRC says: “There is a difference in requirements for what ‘responsibly’ and ‘sustainably’ caught and sourced means in practice and this is detailed in the SSC labelling code. Most BRC members make claims that all their seafood is ‘responsibly sourced’, not ‘responsibly caught’. This is because some of the source fisheries are not yet responsibly managed (so the ‘catching’ is not itself responsible), but the ‘sourcing’ described in the claim relates to the behaviour of the retailer itself.”Shoppers and diners need to read the small print, and not be afraid to question staff on fish counters and in restaurants. Dedicated fishmongers and stalls should be able to tell you where and when their fish was landed, and new services are springing up to cater for the ethical fish buyer: for example, SoleShare, in London, offers the fish equivalent of a vegetable box, delivered each week, offering whatever has come from its network of small boats which use sustainable fishing practices.Fishing in European waters is regulated under the EU’s common fisheries policy, by which quotas are in theory allocated within the limits of what each population of any species can bear. Ethical consumers cannot rely on that, however, as scientific advice on yields is routinely flouted in EU quota allocation. Ministers have pledged that the UK will follow sustainable guidelines for fish catches after Brexit, but the current quota system is likely to stay in place in the short term.Even when fish are caught in areas where stocks are sustainable, damaging practices are still legal. Clarus Chu, the seafood policy manager at WWF, which publishes its own guide for consumers, says: “If not properly managed, some commercial fishing methods, such as gillnets and trawling, can have devastating effects on marine life. They often catch more than just fish, and may trap dolphins, sharks, turtles and whales as bycatch.”Experts agree that by sticking to the big five most popular fish in the UK: cod, haddock, salmon, tuna and prawns, we are putting unbearable and unnecessary pressure on those key species. Trying different types of fish and shellfish is easier than many people think – pollock, hake or coley make good white fish substitutes for cod and haddock, while oily fish such as sardines, mackerel and herring deliver greater health benefits in the form of vital omega-3 oils and are easy to cook. But even while seeking out lesser-seen fish, remember that advice can vary – mackerel from the north-east Atlantic, for instance, had its blue tick withdrawn earlier this year.Sue Davies, the strategic policy adviser at Which?, says shoppers deserve simplified rules, and the government should step in. “It’s still much harder than it should be for people to check whether the fish they are buying in supermarkets or when eating out has been sourced sustainably,” she says. “Our investigations have found that labels can be confusing and food company policies can vary. The government is working on a national food strategy and an important part of that should be driving more sustainable practices and ensuring there is clearer advice about how to make healthy and sustainable choices.”With a large proportion of the fish sold in the UK lacking sustainable certification, the problem for consumers may only be solved if fish from unsustainable sources are removed from the shelves altogether.Westcott adds that ministers could take action now if they wanted: “The government needs to help UK fish stocks and fisheries by introducing a legally binding requirement to fish sustainably, providing full fish stock assessments and reallocating quota to reward sustainable fishing. None of these actions are contingent on Brexit or our relationship with the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ceed54171c54746e47b7a0b1c8f0ed8851614c/0_0_4896_3217/master/4896.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7da24cb33dc70707fb88a74270476e 700w","title":"every angelina jolie film performance ranked","story":"Witness Jolie’s trajectory from 90s jobbing actor to fully fledged Hollywood star – with a few bumps along the way …Semi-coherent thriller about a real-life murder from Jolie’s scrapping-for-any-bit-of-work period. She is hardly in it, but the post-fame DVD sleeve makes her look like the lead character.Jolie’s celebrated first screen appearance, alongside her dad, Jon Voight, in the Hal Ashby directed Vegas comedy. Jolie is a very sweet seven-year-old, but this is mainly of historical interest.Klutzy comedy about rival Italian-American catering dynasties, whose two kids fall in love, Romeo-and-Juliet style. Jolie’s charisma is evident, but the casts’ accents would get them arrested today.Jolie’s first big role, as a cyborg who falls in love with her trainer (“the perfect killing machine … peak condition, top of the line”), in a sequel to the cruddy Jean-Claude Van Damme straight-to-tape. Jolie shows action chops, but line readings are not yet her forte. She reportedly hated it, anyway.Jolie’s first go at the kind of nutso-sexy role that would become a staple for the first part of her career. Danny Aiello plays the sap who gets into trouble after giving her a ride back to her mother’s place.Jolie plays the mystery woman again in this indie thriller about an ex-doctor (David Duchovny) forced to work for gangsters. More hanging out of speeding cars, already by then a Jolie trope.Jolie still marking time and learning her trade in another indie thriller – she plays a woman out to kill an ex-con (Mekhi Phifer) whom she holds responsible for the death of her brother. Not great, but not awful.Jolie tried her hand at a standard-issue romcom – she plays a TV reporter with a week to live, who gets feelings for Ed Burns. Safe to say, sparks did not fly.One of those films you just have to put down to the old learning curve. Jolie plays a mysterious postal bride in 19th-century Cuba who turns Antonio Banderas inside out.Jolie dipped her toe in the big league with this Miramax-distributed multi-stranded ensemble romcom, with names including Gillian Anderson, Sean Connery and Jon Stewart dotting the cast list. Jolie cuts quite a dash in cropped hair and gold lamé trousers.As night follows day, Tomb Raider’s $270m box office brought forth this sequel, in which Lara is after an orb that can open Pandora’s box. Interesting fact: the BBC had a piece of both Tomb Raider films, which is why they are virtual fixtures on iPlayer.Jolie’s activist impulses were engaged after an eye-opening location shoot in Cambodia for Tomb Raider, and in 2001 she was appointed a UNHCR goodwill ambassador. This self-righteous thriller, in which she plays a clueless art-world type entranced by the hunky aid worker Clive Owen, was no doubt an attempt to channel her own conversion. But, presumably, Jolie was rattled by the flak it got, after it was accused of endangering real-world aid workers with a gun-smuggling plotline.Jolie plays the world’s most impeccably styled criminal profiler in a convoluted, but underwhelming, serial-killer movie: Ethan Hawke is the nasty, whose victims provide a new identity for him after every kill.One of Jolie’s more interesting early films, an adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates girl-gang novel. In boots and pixie cut, Jolie really looks the part: she plays another nutso-sexy character – Legs, a drifter who encourages a group of put-upon schoolkids to rebel. Rawer, perhaps, than the recent remake by Laurent Cantet, but an early signpost of Jolie’s potential, and a virtual rehearsal for Girl, Interrupted.Jolie didn’t have a huge amount to do in this amazing-looking steampunk sci-fi thriller, apart from looking purposeful in a military cap and eye patch. She is the commander of an aircraft carrier, helping fighter pilot Jude Law foil evil scientist Dr Totenkopf.DreamWorks’ attempt at a fishy animation was somewhat eclipsed by Pixar’s Finding Nemo, but had a spectacular cast: Will Smith, Robert De Niro and (of all people) Martin Scorsese as a mafioso shark. Jolie had the usual slinkysexy role as an impressively maned fish called Lola, who drapes herself around our hero before being dumped for Renée Zellweger.Never one to neglect the action fanbase, Jolie kept her hand in with the mentor role in this bonkers Matrix-meets-Kingsman thriller starring James McAvoy. Codenamed Fox (duh), she teaches McAvoy how to shoot round corners and become a fully paid-up assassin for a weird cult.Jolie really marked her card with this time-capsule (but inevitably dated-looking) cyber-thriller, starring a panoply of best-forgotten mid-90s haircuts and primitive computer graphics. Alongside her future first husband Jonny Lee Miller, Jolie made what was the first of a series of attention-grabbing, film-stealing performances.A lengthy, solemn film about the early days of the CIA in the 1960s, directed by Robert De Niro and featuring lots of men in hats and raincoats. Jolie glows in characteristic style as the unhappy wife of dour agent Matt Damon her opportunities for spying are strictly limited, and her role is there to show the domestic price men such as Damon’s character pay.Another mentor role for Jolie as one of the “furious five” ninja-warrior animals who train up Jack Black’s useless giant panda. The film is a lot of fun, but despite getting third billing – behind Black and Dustin Hoffman – Jolie’s tiger role is a bit on the thin side. Two sequels continued the pattern, although her roles are so small, they don’t really warrant separate entries here.In 2001 what the world wanted to see was Jolie racing around in her skimpies while handling enormous weapons – and they paid to see it, big time. As unwatchable as every video game movie yet produced, Tomb Raider at least had the novelty of Jolie trying out a ludicrous posh-English accent and – all joking aside – showed that Jolie could carry a movie single-handedly, however idiotic it was. It was the one that put her over the top.Presumably hoping for a bit of the old Brad Pitt-style on-screen chemistry, Jolie paired up with Johnny Depp for another go at the smouldering mismatch action-comedy thriller. Depp, not especially funny, is the hapless tourist scooped up by Jolie’s femme fatale as cover Jolie, styled to the max, seems to mostly coast through things. Nobody’s finest moment.On the brink of stardom, Jolie appeared in this adaptation of Jeffery Deaver’s doorstop serial-killer thriller featuring a quadriplegic forensic analyst, Lincoln Rhyme, played by Denzel Washington. She is the fresh-faced rookie cop who follows Rhyme’s orders as they track down a vicious taxi-driving murderer, and pretty much nails it. This was a crucial step in proving she could handle a solid Hollywood moneymaker.Jolie’s second sexy-mythological mum role, in Robert Zemeckis’s adaptation of the epic poem. Zemeckis’s decision to go with motion-capture and CGI means this lives very much in the uncanny valley, but it allows him to get away with what the male teen fanbase was slavering for: a full-body nude shot of Jolie as she emerges from a lake of fire, albeit refracted through a glassy, liquid-metal texture.Jolie couldn’t have found a better role than that of Gia Carangi, the meteorically successful, but self-destructive, model who died in 1986. Jolie fitted the wild-child persona perfectly: this HBO film got her a Golden Globe and a ticket to the Hollywood elite.Jolie was, notoriously, only a year older than Colin Farrell when she was cast as his mother in the Oliver Stone classical-era epic, which turned out to be a riotous fusion of semi-history and sword-and-sandal fantasy. Encumbered with yet another odd accent, Jolie nevertheless turned up the dial to 11 with a tigerish performance of roaring, vengeful fury, mashed together with gruesome mother-son lasciviousness.This was Jolie’s first big action hit, in what in retrospect was a frighteningly influential blockbuster (where would the Fast and the Furious films be without it?) As the dreadlocked Sway, Jolie proved proficient as the supercool badass and the hot-to-trot arm candy. Hollywood was not quite ready to trust her with a film of her own, but it was only a matter of time.Jolie’s move into directing was designed to complement her activist work, with films about the Bosnian war, a second world war PoW and the Khmer Rouge. By the Sea, however, was very different: a highly personal relationship drama, consciously modelled on European new-wave cinema of Deray or Antonioni. Very much a vanity project, it was widely derided as a second Swept Away, but that is not really fair: it was never going to get the big bucks. Jolie said it was inspired by her mother, but Pitt’s presence as the other half of a troubled marriage gave this a through-the-keyhole air. Their own relationship disintegrated a year after its release.Jolie distilled all her self-destructivemanipulativesexy roles into this career gamechanger: she blew away the film’s ostensible lead, Winona Ryder, and bagged an Oscar into the bargain. In retrospect, with the ostentatious tonal palette of khaki and beige, this does look like a pretty odd depiction of a psychiatric hospital, even though it is based on a memoir: it resembles a Gap ad shot at the Institute for Extreme Hotness. The supporting cast were all major figures in waiting, too: Elisabeth Moss, Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall.One of those amazing films that even if you have no idea what is actually happening – it’s a thriller about air-traffic control – still manage to be incredibly exciting. By this time, Jolie’s extracurricular activities had become stories in themselves, and her relationship with co-star Billy Bob Thornton (soon to become husband No 2) was a subject of tabloid notoriety, not the least those vials of blood they were rumoured to have exchanged. Jolie’s role is another of her manipulative, free-spirit numbers, but taken somewhat to extremes: weepyneedy one minute, overpoweringly seductive the next. But the film itself is so great, it just seems to work.Even though she was given the nod by the film’s real-life subject, Mariane Pearl, Jolie took quite a bit of flak for playing the role of the Cuban-Dutch journalist whose husband, Daniel, was murdered in 2002 by a terror group in Pakistan. Darkening her skin tone was controversial enough in 2007 these days it would be considered close to blackface. However, in conjunction with the British docudrama specialist Michael Winterbottom, Jolie spearheaded a powerful, politically inflected drama, a more convincing use of her activist inclinations than the likes of Beyond Borders. Jolie also exercised acting muscles that she had rarely employed in the previous decade.Perhaps given a shot in the arm by A Mighty Heart, Jolie went full throttle for an Oscar in Clint Eastwood’s classy, grandiose true crime drama, based on the infamous Wineville chicken coop murders in the 1920s. Jolie plays Christine Collins, a woman whose son, Walter, was among the victims, but who was pressured into identifying another boy as her missing son. Jolie goes through the whole gamut of actorly emotions, from bafflement to rage to breakdown she gives it her considerable all, but it didn’t quite get her over the line, beaten to the statuette by Kate Winslet for The Reader.This was an early example of muscle-flexing Hollywood gender-swap: originally a Tom Cruise vehicle, this was reworked after Jolie got involved, switching the sex of the lead character, but leaving in all the head-cracking derring-do that goes with the Mission-Impossible-y turf. Jolie pulls it off spectacularly: her proficiency in the action movie verities beyond reproach, while injecting enough emotion into the moodier passages to give the character some bite. Not sure why this hasn’t become a franchise the boring title probably didn’t help.Disney cleverly exploited Jolie’s otherworldly qualities – ethereally satanic probably best describes them – in this revisionist fairytale, in which Jolie plays the wicked witch from Sleeping Beauty with a considerably more sympathetic backstory. The image of her with curling black horns and digitally enhanced cheekbones is one that will go with her for ever – the word “iconic” is overused, but this one merits it. The film itself isn’t quite kidult – more kiddy than adulty – but it’s still a feast for the eyes, and Jolie evinces real pain as the fairy who loses her wings.I prefer Jolie in her hard-as-nails incarnation rather than, say, her dewy-eyed do-gooder or manipulative bad-girl modes and spy films tend to bring out her sense of humour as well as reining in her frequent habit of going over the top. Here she gets to do a bit of everything that makes her a great performer: terrific action scenes, screwball-level marital comedy, some really rather impressive emoting. It also helped, of course, that there was a real-life backstory to the relationship between her and her co-star, Brad Pitt: this, of course, was the film set where “Brangelina” was born. Oddly enough, this film stands as a comic companion piece to By the Sea: it’s also about a jaded marriage flailing around for reinvigoration. It says something, though, that while Mr \u0026amp Mrs Smith is a lot of fun, no one could mistake it for a masterpiece: Jolie, without doubt a stone-cold superstar, tends to be better andor bigger than the films she has been in. But she has plenty of time to put that right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4596e2e74b5f9d4e98c3aba47b0d842442423e05/568_461_1807_1084/master/1807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a5668cc0217ccf356cf104e3625df90","title":"always cooking the same thing try a weekly food box","story":"In the days when Abel \u0026amp Cole was the only game in town, I blew very hot and cold on vegetable boxes.

Your heart turns against them. Is it in any way reasonable to send you a carrot in May, when you have been eating them all winter? (The Fitbit equivalent, by the way, is when it runs out of battery and you remember how livable life still is even when you have no idea how many steps you’ve done and may not have done any.)I went through this love-hate cycle a few times in the 00s, and in the meantime the world moved on.

You end up eating lentils for breakfast, but that’s so unholy that you have another breakfast on top of that. I tried the Balance Box for a month, once, for an article, and I think I ate it all as well as my regular food.The services have moved on again to include full-meal solutions for the time-poor, and fruit-and-vegetable solutions for those who hate the idea of food waste. I have just tried Hello Fresh for the first and Oddbox for the second and, broadly, everything that was wrong with either was really something wrong with me.Hello Fresh always seems to have an offer running, which brought the cost down by half to £2.50 per person per meal. A three-meal-a-week box for £15, for a couple, is completely reasonable. Yet the thrifty wartime homemaker in me was constantly complaining – maybe if I’d got the chicken from a market, at five in the morning, off the floor, it would have been cheaper. If anything, not having anything to complain about made it worse.But I just don’t think other people’s portions are big enough. There was plenty of nutrition in them more than plenty – over 1,400 calories a person in the cumin roast-pork recipe. But if I’d been making it myself, there would have been more on the plate. This put me in a scarcity mindset, which is a disaster for family harmony. I was being ridiculous.The recipes are simple but quite bold in flavour, the ingredients are good, the instructions are very clear, especially if you don’t mind being addressed like someone who has never handled meat before (I am way too old to be told to wash my hands), and the repertoire is good. There’s always a cute touch, an aubergine you weren’t expecting, some blue cheese sauce. Unless you specify “quick”, they don’t try to keep everything down to half an hour. I really admire this service, in almost every particular I just don’t like being told what to do, and always like to have too much on the table.With Oddbox, I could overcater like wild. It was £13.50 for a vegetable-only box for a large family, which isn’t us, because the children eat only peas. With a tiny adjustment to regular life – eating kale by choice – this makes it cheaper than buying veg in a shop. It’s explicitly thrifty in a broader, social sense, on food miles and – sorry, the main point – it’s food that would otherwise have been thrown away because the producers couldn’t sell it. There was either too much of it for the supermarkets or it supposedly looked funny, though, in fact, none of it did.This is a radical leap forward from the old days. I have never had baby courgettes by subscription before, and only very rarely seen chicory. Sure, there were onions, potatoes and carrots, lettuce, broccoli, fennel, spinach – these are not endangered species – but I have nothing against staples as long as there is fancy stuff. I made algarve carrots, the ones they give you in bars to make you drink more, and creamed spinach, like ordering a stroke in a classic French bistro. I shaved fennel and put chilli on broccoli and made hasselback potatoes for the hell of it. The only thing I had left was the lettuce, and I gave that to a rabbit. My fridge looked like a delicatessen, I smelled constantly of garlic, I finished a load of kippers I had in the freezer because I’m not, when it really comes down to it, a vegetarian, and, once again, I felt high all week on my own virtue.I would recommend either service for a person who is hungry, and doesn’t want to surrender to the unchanging menus of their own conformity. But for the self-righteous, there is nothing like a box of invisibly deformed vegetables."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a88f2d4286524b9c7b561221a1599b5bf9af2595/0_323_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5218ce89384aaf46758fc05ca79ec988","title":"mohamed salah inspired me become muslim liverpool islam","story":"Mohamed Salah really and honestly inspired me. I’m a Nottingham Forest season-ticket holder, I can be myself but because I made the declaration of faith I’m a Muslim. I’m still me and that’s what I took from Mohamed Salah. I’d love to meet him, just to shake his hand and say “Cheers” or “Shukran”.I don’t think my mates quite believe that I’m a Muslim because I’ve not really changed. I just think my heart is better. I’m really trying to change on match days. Normally it’s pub, put a bet on, then after the game back to the pub and realise you’ve lost a lot of money. It’s hard when you’re used to such a culture and it’s part of football for a lot of people.I’m embarrassed to say this but my opinions on Islam used to be that the religion, the culture and the people were backward that they didn’t integrate and wanted to take over. I always looked at Muslims like the elephant in the room. I had a hatred of Muslims.When I was in sixth form it was a period where I think I needed someone to blame for my misfortunes. Unfortunately Muslims got the brunt of it and I quickly discovered right-wing media pages. They sort of groomed me by sending me long propaganda pieces and suchlike.Even though I had these horrible ideas of Islam, I would never say them to a Muslim. At this point I didn’t know any Muslims. My degree in Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Leeds changed everything.We had to do a dissertation and I wanted to do something a bit different. I remember my dyslexia tutor telling me: “What about Mohamed Salah’s song?” I was aware of it and I thought it was fantastic but I hadn’t considered it in those terms.I finally got the question: “Mohamed Salah, a gift from Allah. Is the performance of Mohamed Salah igniting a conversation that combats Islamapobia within the media and political spheres?”The Liverpool fans’ song – to the tune of Dodgy’s hit Good Enough – includes the line “If he scores another few then I’ll be Muslim too”, and I literally took that to heart.I was a typical white-boy student who went to a different city, would get absolutely hammered and lived the student life. My degree was the first time I learned about Islam in an academic way.University gave me the opportunity to meet a lot of students from Saudi Arabia. I thought they were evil people who carried swords but they’re the nicest people I’ve met. The conceptions I had about Arab countries completely dissolved.Mohamed Salah was the first Muslim I could relate to. It’s the way he lives his life, how he talks to people. The other week he posed for a picture with a Liverpool fan who suffered a broken nose chasing after him. I know some other footballers would do that but you expect it now from Salah.At university I interviewed Egyptian students and when they found out my research was about “Mohamed Salah, a gift from Allah” – which is also another Liverpool song – they would talk to me for hours about how great he is and what he’s done for their country. One million Egyptians spoiled their ballots and voted for him to be president last year.One of the Egyptians I talked to told me that Salah encompasses what being a Muslim is, following Islam correctly. He believed that Salah is making people love Muslims again.That really resonated with me. When Salah scores I think he’s scoring for the faith. When he won the Champions League I said to my friend that was a victory for Islam. After each of his goals Salah practises the sujood (prostration) and exposes a very Islamic symbol to the world. How many people watch the Premier League every week? Millions globally.Salah showed me that you can be normal and a Muslim, if that’s the right phrase. You can be yourself. He’s a great player and is respected by the football community and his politics, his religion, don’t matter – and to me that’s what football can do.When people read the Quran, or read about Islam, they see something different that is not always portrayed in the media. I’m new to the Islamic community and I’m still learning. It is hard. It’s a lifestyle change.What would I say to the Ben of old? I’d give him a smack, to be honest, and I’d say: ‘How dare you think like that about a people that are so erse. You need to start talking to people. You need to start asking the questions.’ We live in a multicultural, multifaith, multinational society.Last season Chelsea fans were singing “Salah is a bomber”. That’s the first time on my social media that I had a right go. I was livid because I’m for football banter but you know when things are just not true.Now, I’d say to Muslim kids: ‘Don’t be afraid to go to a football match.’ I think that’s an issue we have to look at from both sides. I was afraid of being segregated. I don’t want to lose my mates because I look at them as brothers to me. Now I’ve got a fifth of the world’s population as brothers and sisters.The community has to branch out, play football, go to football. It’s up to us to realise that we’re in this together. And the best spokesman for that could be Mohamed Salah.Ben Bird was speaking to Tusdiq Din"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a7f9dd05d41b0123fcdb7c5ac3ace739e419f47/0_140_4549_2730/master/4549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f907045fa03535dd77876913b025d29","title":"workers at dubai expo 2020 heat stress","story":"Exclusive: ‘World’s greatest show’ could be linked to cardiorespiratory failures in labourers building infrastructureThousands of migrant construction workers employed on huge infrastructure and building projects ahead of next year’s Expo 2020 exhibition in Dubai are likely to have been exposed to dangerous levels of heat stress, a  investigation has found.Dubai will host the Expo 2020 next year, in which 190 countries will come together to celebrate themes of mobility, innovation and sustainability in a series of bespoke, themed pavilions across a 4.38 sq km site in Dubai South economic zone.Yet a  investigation has found that migrant workers who have been building the infrastructure, accommodation blocks and national pavilions across the summer months could have been working in unsafe and potentially fatal conditions.The United Arab Emirates is a dangerous place for the hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers who travel from their homes in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh to work in the heat and dust of one of the wealthiest countries in the world.Every year hundreds of workers – mostly young men – who have travelled from India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh, die while working in the Gulf state.Heat places a huge strain on the cardiovascular system with extreme heat stress leading to potentially fatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular failures.Recent research by cardiologists and climatologists concluded that exposure to extreme heat stress was linked to the deaths of hundreds of Nepali migrant workers in Qatar, which has similar weather conditions to the UAE.The authorities in the UAE, in line with other countries across the Gulf, has said they are protecting workers from heat-related injuries through a work ban that prohibits manual labour in unshaded outdoor areas between 12.30–3pm from June–August.However the ’s weather analysis found that the summer work ban in the UAE does not keep workers safe. Anyone working outside who is performing even moderate physical labour is exposed to potentially fatal levels of heat stress for the majority of the working day from June–September every year.British companies McLaren and Laing O’Rourke are currently working on Expo 2020 projects.The UK’s Department for International Trade awarded the £21m contract to build the UK Expo 2020 pavilion, which is inspired by Stephen Hawking’s “breakthrough message” initiative, to Pico and McLaren. McLaren is also working on construction at Dubai airport.Laing O’Rourke is working on a contract to build the Leadership and Media pavilions, as well as the “Hammerhead” access road to the central event space for Expo 2020 Dubai.The companies said that they have robust heat strategies in place that go above and beyond the 12–3pm summer work ban imposed by the UAE government.McLaren said that construction work on the UK pavilion is being timed to coincide with cooler temperatures. It also has detailed heat mitigation measures in place including chilled welfare areas, shaded rest areas on site and amended work schedules based on expected heat levels.Laing O’Rourke said that it had specific summer working policies in place and well-defined procedures on how to implement these measures.UK non-profit organisation the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) said that a survey it conducted of construction companies operating in the UAE last year found that many did not have robust heat monitoring programmes in place.“Although British companies are doing comparatively well at taking the issue of heat stress seriously compared to many of their peers, all international construction companies in the UAE operate with an unacceptable level of risk to their workers,” said Diana Eltahawy, Gulf programme manager at BHRRC. used weather data from 2008–2017 to calculate the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) for UAE, an internationally used metric that uses wind speed, solar radiation, humidity and air temperature to assess the impact of heat stress on the human body.A WGBT reading of 28C (82F) and above is internationally accepted as the point at which the human body is dangerously affected by heat stress.An Expo 2020 spokesperson said, “Our assurance standards require contractors to develop and implement an all-year-round ‘weather working plan’ detailing arrangements for working safely in the heat (over and above the UAE legislation on summer-time working). All contractors are required to establish calibrated project weather stations which monitor the thermal work limit, which takes into account wet-globe temperature, dry-bulb temperature, globe temperature and wind speed. Contractor plans include specific action levels and arrangements to be undertaken at each level. Our working in the heat policies, procedures and associated arrangements apply throughout the year and we run courses and programmes to support them.”The UK’s Department for International Trade said: “DIT has taken a series of measures to ensure high health and safety standards are maintained for all workers at the UK pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai site.”The United Arab Emirates government did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db07d3e0b74b426e58ee685666b0a00ac532b84/0_366_1427_855/master/1427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7ab0a1cf97a2782b33b7c42d1299499","title":"angel olsen all mirrors review","story":"(Jagjaguwar) Literate, melodious songs twist into dissonance and darkness on Olsen’s new album. It’s a rewarding, unexpected listenThere are artists who seem to explode into the public consciousness at first sight, and there are artists whose career gradually builds to a tipping point. That’s where Angel Olsen would appear to find herself. She started life as the kind of artist it seemed easy to peg. Her sound was literate, folky, lo-fi and downcast. She had graduated from releasing EPs and cassettes to a deal with US indie Jagjaguwar, a label that’s released a lot of great music, but almost always of a certain stripe: “8.8 from Pitchfork” could be their in-house slogan. But Olsen’s third album, 2016’s My Woman, signified a noticeable shift: less introverted, more polished, poppy, and occasionally electronic, it also boasted a hitherto-unnoticed tendency to rock in a straightforward style. It didn’t just get 8.8 from Pitchfork, it broke the lower reaches of the US Top 50 and spawned a successful single in Shut Up Kiss Me, a song that you can imagine rousing a huge festival crowd. A bit more of that, ran the general consensus, and mainstream success was a given: an assumption bolstered by her guest appearance on Mark Ronson’s recent album Late Night Feelings.Or perhaps not. Three years on, the opening of Olsen’s follow-up suggests that the unexpected shift of My Woman told you more about Olsen’s interest in unexpected shifts than her desire to be a mainstream star. On paper, Lark doesn’t seem like anything particularly out of the ordinary: it’s a heavily orchestrated ballad, on which strings are bolstered by thundering, Phil Spector-ish drums, and we’ve all heard a lot of those over the years. But the arrangement of Lark doesn’t cleave to the standard epic alt-rock ballad mode: it isn’t trying to mimic the high drama of Scott Walker’s late 60s albums, nor the romantic lushness of the Beach Boys circa Pet Sounds, nor the cinematic swoon of Serge Gainsbourg’s Histoire de Melody Nelson, nor any of the other things that alt-rock artists tend to do when they decide to favour the world with an epic ballad. Instead, the strings drone and churn and, occasionally, screech, as if signifying a moment of alarm on the soundtrack of an old thriller. The song itself is beautiful, but the arrangement seems constantly on the verge of dissonance, which lends the track tension and edge. What should on the face of it feel familiar feels anything but.That seems to be as close as All Mirrors gets to a USP: it’s an album that keeps taking ostensibly recognisable musical forms and twisting them out of shape into something challenging and intriguing. The title track deals in a certain kind of alt-rock’s current favourite mode – 80s-influenced synths drifting dreamily along – and shifts its mood completely. Olsen starts out singing in the standard blank-eyed style that goes with dreamy 80s synths, but gradually ratchets up the intensity until it feels discomfiting. Then another off-kilter string arrangement crashes in: the effect isn’t lush so much as oppressive, deliberately crowded with sound.Spring starts life with a piano modulating in Hey Jude style, but quickly turns odd. Olsen’s vocal is dry and deliberately high in the mix: for all the prettiness of the melody she’s singing, the effect is weirdly claustrophobic, a sensation increased by a burst of queasily out-of-tune synthesised bells. You would describe Endgame as atmospheric and ambient, were it not for the fact that those adjectives suggest something soothing and warm, and the atmosphere Endgame conjures up is sickly and distended, occasionally lapsing into eerie silence. Olsen’s voice suddenly loses its swathe of reverb, sounding in the process as if she’s singing in your ear. A solitary beam of warm light in an otherwise dark and disturbing album comes with the closer Chance, a straightforwardly beautiful, if vocally wracked, ballad that looks to 50s doo wop for inspiration.The lyrics suggest that a break-up is at the heart of All Mirrors’ stylistic shifts: the first words you hear on the album are “to forget you is too hard” the relatively upbeat Chance grasps gingerly at the prospect of reconciliation or new love. What’s striking about what happens in between is how skilful it is at upending the listener’s preconceptions, never turning out quite as you assume it will. It’s not easy listening, despite the preponderance of melodies, something that Olsen’s plan to release an entirely acoustic version in the future seems to acknowledge: its intensity is always set so high, it automatically makes demands of the listener. But it is rewarding: the sound of Angel Olsen skilfully mapping out an unanticipated new territory for herself, further out on the left-field.

Racing rather than academia always beckoned for Leclerc but right now, in the pressure-cooker environment of driving for Ferrari, this young driver is learning an awful lot of lessons. Every indication is that they are being taken to heart, forging a formidable character.At last weekend’s Russian Grand Prix, Ferrari’s plan to govern their drivers through the opening corners fell apart publicly and with lasting ramifications. With Leclerc on pole and his teammate Sebastian Vettel in third, the team were focused on keeping Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes, starting in second, away from the lead. To do so their arrangement was that Leclerc would give Vettel a slipstream into turn two, and if the German gained an advantage in doing so and took the lead, they would then swap positions.Vettel enjoyed a great start, passed Hamilton and then took the slipstream and the lead. What followed was classic Ferrari and classic Vettel. The team ordered the swap, Vettel refused as an aggrieved Leclerc questioned why the deal was being ignored. Ultimately Ferrari got their place change through the pit stops, giving Leclerc a strong undercut, although the principal, Mattia Binotto, argued somewhat unconvincingly that it was not deliberate. In a way Ferrari were fortunate that further friction between the two on track was avoided when Vettel retired with a mechanical failure and Leclerc finished in third behind both Mercedes.That left Binotto and Ferrari with considerable damage-control to deal with. There was Vettel, blatantly ignoring team orders. Then the use of such complex and unnecessary diktats in a season where the championship is gone, allied to their clumsy implementation and lack of planing for the not-unlikely scenario that Vettel was quicker. Finally there was Leclerc, unhappy but still playing the team game afterwards, expressing publicly that he still trusted Vettel. Binotto suggested the solution lay in defining plans with greater complexity. “Maybe we have to be more precise before the races,” he said.Leclerc will likely draw a simpler conclusion. He was witness to the ruthless, victory-driven Vettel of the Multi21 incident. In Malaysia in 2013, when Vettel overtook Mark Webber against his Red Bull team’s “hold station” Multi21 order for the win, this hard edge was clear. “My intention if you look at it as a racing driver is to win the race,” Vettel said afterwards. “So I don’t apologise for winning the race.”On Sunday evening in Sochi, sat beside Binotto and Vettel, Leclerc’s response surely reflected his new understanding of where he stands with Vettel. “In the car there was an agreement,” he said. “That’s all I can say.”When Max Verstappen pushed Leclerc wide at Austria this year, the Monegasque insisted it was a lesson learned. “I think I will just conclude that we can go a bit further in our aggressiveness on track,” he said. When he went toe to toe with Verstappen at Silverstone, he was unforgiving about getting his elbows in. At Monza Hamilton discovered Leclerc had still not forgotten Austria when he squeezed the world champion wide with calculated control on his way to victory.He will have taken similar lessons from Russia. Ferrari may wish to make ever more intricate arrangements for their drivers, but Leclerc will now have no qualms about pursuing his own ends with the same ruthlessness Vettel displayed.Ross Brawn, F1’s sporting director and technical director at Ferrari during Michael Schumacher’s successful years at the team, described Leclerc as an “incredible talent” after Russia. In Brawn’s time at Ferrari the Scuderia were no strangers to using team orders and he recognised the difficulty of now maintaining harmony at Ferrari. “It’s a potentially explosive combination and needs careful handling,” he said, stressing that the pressure was now really on Binotto to manage his drivers. “After today we will be even more aggressive,” Binotto said on Sunday. “Third place hurts us, because this result is the result of our mistakes.”Yet he must consider that one of his drivers will now need no encouragement to be similarly combative toward his teammate. This year Leclerc has suffered bad luck – the mechanical problem at Bahrain that cost him a win – and made mistakes, such as his crash in qualifying at Baku. But he has delivered some brilliant performances: qualifying in Singapore and the wins at Spa and Monza. It is worth remembering that Hamilton came through a similar crucible in his first season and followed it with his first title.Throughout it all Leclerc has maintained that every event has been positive in his development as a driver. Given his form, the embrace of these experiences is only making him stronger. Leclerc is rapidly becoming a fearsome graduate of F1’s school of hard knocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8033bf28e4f1e9b54fc903e335a130785a3af412/0_192_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1826f849b962121895612bf846c7047","title":"ireland v russia rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"51 mins: Ireland 21-0 Russia From the lineout, the new man Ostrikov clatters John Ryan, rocking his head back.

It isn’t pretty by any means, but they get it done. Three green shirts converge on Sychev and Ruddock scrambles over! Sexton adds the extras.33 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Bogdan Fedotko’s difficult day continues - he gets a yellow card for a series of transgressions as Russia desperately try to keep Ireland from the line. Penalty advantage, but Sexton’s floated pass to Conway is forward, so we come back for the scrum ...32 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia The Russians are giving too many penalties away, the latest presenting Ireland with a lineout 10m out. They would love a third try just now ...29 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia From a Russian scrum, Gaisin skips forward and delivers a dart of a kick into touch. Ireland pegged back a little, but they win the lineout. Russian scrum-half Dmitry Perov is too eager to try and intercept McGrath’s offload, and gets penalised.27 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Bad news for Ireland as Jordi Murphy, who only flew out on Sunday, is forced off. CJ Stander comes off the bench, but the back row injuries are mounting.25 mins: Ireland 14-0 Russia Russia have the lineout, but Gaisin slips as he tries to clear, and the ball ricochets off O’Mahony.

He’s replaced by Vladimir Ostroushko.A handling error presents Ireland with possession deep in Russian territory, and Sexton pounces, his grubber kick slicing open the defence and allowing O’Mahony to run through and slide into the left-hand post.

From the Ireland lineout, Rob Kearney finds a gap and has too much power and pace for Simplikevich, who can’t keep him from forcing his way over. Sexton’s conversion sneaks inside the right post.1 min: An exchange of kicks, before Russian fly-half Ramil Gaisin finds touch.Jerome Garces is the man in the middle. Russia, decked out in all-red, kick things off.While you wait for kick-off, here’s this week’s Breakdown from the ever-excellent Paul Rees:Here’s Joe Schmidt: “Joey just had a bit of ankle soreness after the Captain’s Run, and Conor Murray is keen to get back in there, which makes it easier. Johnny Sexton is fit, Japan came a bit too soon but he’s had a comfortable turnaround. The first 20 minutes against Japan was very good, but we became hesitant, quite anxious. I’d like to replicate that start, but build on it today.”Some intriguing pre-game reading from Ben Ryan, on how Ireland and others can bounce back from a defeat by sticking to the plan:A couple of names to look out for: for Ireland, Jordi Murphy starts at eight, having flown out to Japan earlier this week after Jack Conan was injured. For Russia, captain and full-back Vasily Artemyev, who played for Blackrock school in Leinster, and was even called up by Ireland’s under-19 side, before opting to play for the country of his birth.In today’s early kick-off, Fiji earned their first win of the tournament, brushing Georgia aside in a 45-10 win:Some breaking team news - Joey Carbery is a late withdrawal from the bench. Conor Murray takes his place, having originally been rested.Time for Plan B, then. Ireland’s meticulously crafted route to an overdue World Cup breakthrough did not account for events in Shizuoka, where Japan made the world’s top-ranked team look distinctly second best.What does it change? On paper, not much. Two bonus-point wins and they will escape their pool and reach the quarter-finals, where a southern hemisphere titan awaits. In reality, everything is different now. Take today’s game, which should have been a chance to ease through the gears against Pool A’s lowest-ranked team. Instead, there will be scrutiny on this reshuffled side’s every move, and the need for bonus points will bring its own pressure.Perhaps the return of talisman Johnny Sexton will ease Irish worries. Perhaps this early setback will sharpen up Joe Schmidt’s squad, and pay off in the long run. The result appears a foregone conclusion - Russia are 150-1 to win - but for Ireland, everything else is still uncertain.Kick-off: 11.15am BST, 8.15pm in Kobe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ae226509eb276b930198e0bb4ba2a3f3d62f3ed/0_219_4817_2892/master/4817.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92833614654d72a5aea895de2acedf2f","title":"featherstone toronto wolfpack super league","story":"Featherstone have already beaten three teams in the play-offs. Surely they won’t complete the set in the final on Saturday? By Gavin Willacy for No Helmets RequiredFor nearly two years, Toronto Wolfpack have been edging towards a place in the Super League. On Saturday they might finally seal it. This time last year, almost everyone assumed they would beat London Broncos to clinch their seat at the top table. But like a runaway horse leading the Grand National, they froze at the final hurdle. Again, Brian McDermott’s team of NRL and Super League veterans are up against underdogs who have nothing to lose. This time Featherstone Rovers are standing in their way.Despite their superb performance at Leigh and impressive win at York, no one outside the rhubarb triangle can have expected Featherstone to win at Toulouse last Sunday, let alone by a 36-12 scoreline. Now for Toronto in the Championship play-off final. Surely they cannot win four away matches in four consecutive weekends against the four teams who finished above them in the league? That would be an astonishing achievement, especially for a club with a mixture of full-time imports, part-time locals and borrowed bodies.It would be strangely fitting if Featherstone reached the Super League now, just as the ision is preparing to open up to a whole new continent, given that they were shoved into the second ision to make way for London Broncos when the competition was formed back in 1995.Featherstone winning promotion would be a mixed blessing for the other clubs in the league. Featherstone would take up London’s “bound to finish bottom” role and their large away followings would be welcome across the M62 corridor. However, a win for Featherstone would cost the 11 other clubs well over £100,000 in TV money. If Featherstone go up, they would take their share of money from Sky, whereas Toronto have vowed to generate their own TV deal. Far more importantly, if the Wolfpack do not go up, the league would miss out on the extraordinary opportunity to reach 20 million people and a whole new sports media market in Canada.So, who are these Featherstone heroes from Post Office Road who could put a giant ner in the Wolfpack’s works? Super League watchers will recognise the pony-tailed Ashton Golding at full-back, seemingly persona non grata at Leeds not long after being the next big thing. They have former France half-back Dane Chisholm, a mercurial talent often accused of doing his own thing at Bradford but now harnessing his creativity for the good of the team. Alongside him is youngster Callum McLelland, on loan from Leeds, who was playing rugby union in Scotland last year.Second-rower Josh Walters scored the winning try in a Super League Grand Final not long ago, when he was a rising talent at Leeds. And there’s Championship stalwarts such as John Davies, consistently good, sometimes excellent, but who looks too small to play prop in the big league. The same was said of London’s Eddie Battye this time last year. Given a chance, Davies could shine in the top flight.Papua New Guinea prop Wellington Albert and former NRL hooker Cameron King offer exotic flavour – although Rovers have pulled off these play-off miracles without King, who has been missing due to concussion. Masterminding the project is rookie head coach Paul Carr, who is quickly becoming a hot property. The 31-year-old Australian is now also part of the coaching team at Featherstone’s partner club, Leeds Rhinos.Understandably, Featherstone have been planning for life in the second tier next season, signing former Hull Kingston Rover, Thomas Minns, and proven Championship performers Louis Jouffret, Dean Parata and Alec Susino. Pull off another miracle on Saturday and Carr will have to go shopping in a different market on Monday morning.Having finished fifth in the Championship, Fev were not given much of a hope in the play-offs. However, only Toronto and Toulouse scored more points or conceded fewer in the league. Like Salford, they can beat anyone when they hit top gear. Yes, Toronto won 26 of their 27 games all season. But the final is uncannily similar to last year, when Toronto’s promotion party was quashed in extraordinary fashion by outsiders London Broncos in a tryless slug-fest. It couldn’t happen again, could it?Were Salford to win the Super League play-off semi-final at Wigan on Friday night, it would rival Featherstone for story of the season. Salford are no mugs. Ian Watson’s side are packed with experienced Super League players reaching the peaks of their careers, while maverick playmaker Jackson Hastings brings out the best in the mere mortals around him.The pack is filled with low-profile warriors in the form of their lives: Adam Walker, back from a drugs ban George Griffin captain Lee Mossop and the Hull-bound Josh Jones – surely the first player to list Taunton RFC and the Great Britain squad on his CV. They are as good as any in the competition. Make it to Old Trafford for the Grand Final and Watson will deserve a statue in Salford’s Hall of Fame, whatever St Helens have in store for them.The Middle East-Africa Championship takes place this week in Lagos, with Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Morocco in action. Nigeria have just launched a nine-team league and the best of that competition have been joined by London Broncos’ Lagos-born prop Sadiq Adebiyi and three amateurs from England, while Ghana have two players from Brixton Bulls and Coventry Bears’ semi-pro Reece Connor Rance alongside their domestic squad. Five of the Cameroon’s six clubs – including eight from Yaounde’s Bulls RL – are in their squad, while fallen African force Morocco have four semi-pros from France in their player pool. The final is on Saturday.Rugby league’s international eligibility rules have come in for some stick over the years but the RLIF can feel pretty pleased with their decision to allow players to return to their tier-two nations having played for Australia, New Zealand or England. World Rugby, union’s governing body, have refused to follow suit, leaving Tonga at the World Cup without several players who left them to pursue heroic status and fortune with the All Blacks.Meanwhile, the NRL have named Italy’s Nathan Brown and Paul Vaughan, Lebanon’s Mitchell Moses and former Wales forward Tyson Frizell in the Australia Prime Minister’s XIII to play Fiji on 12 October. Hopefully they will all return to their second-tier nations for Rugby League World Cup in 2021 if not selected for the Kangaroos.I missed the Toulouse v Featherstone game as I was on my annual week in a South Devon cottage with no internet, Sky or mobile coverage. It reminded me how important the BBC is to our game. On the long drive down I was able to listen to three hours of coverage of Salford v Castleford, flicking between the excellent broadcasts by Dave Woods on 5 Live Sports Extra and Mark Wilson on Talksport2. My wife was thrilled. On Friday night, Saints-Wigan on 5 Live accompanied us through the winding lanes from Slapton Sands. And on Sunday teatime I was able to enjoy extensive highlights of both on BBC1. Pity that the Beeb’s TV coverage should come nearly three days after the game.• This is an article by Gavin Willacy.

In this marvellously scrappy show – a seesaw of sliding power – two stubborn clowns desperately search for the right nerve to snap in the other.Lack of communication reigns as Bertrand Lesca and Nasi Voutsas talk across, over and under each other. Nasi stands at the top of a ladder. Bert pleads with him to come down. Nasi refuses. “This,” he says, waving his hand to imply the distance between them, “works for me.” Sanity unspools as each refuses to compromise in a series of physical and verbal games of tug-of-war the rope being their bodies, their accents, their feelings for the other. They retreat and attack like mosquitos averting a swatting hand.They are ugly in their impudence, though just as entertaining to us as they are frustrating to each other. We’re quickly dragged into the conflict as they make us pick sides. Do we condone their cruelty? Can we make them stop? When will we stop playing along? Tensions escalate until Bert is threatening to knock over an audience member on his bike on their walk home.One is the finale of Bert and Nasi’s political two-hander trilogy, following Eurohouse, which dealt with the scuffles between EU member states, and Palmyra, which grappled with the destruction of the ancient Syrian city through broken crockery. Unlike the previous two shows, One is not centred on a particular conflict, but you only have to look to Westminster or the White House to see the same games being played.The shape of the show is as aesthetically scruffy as their battles are emotionally petty. But in their exhaustion, there are glimmers of something past the violence and competition. We are given multiple options for the closing scene and, tonight, we choose the happy ending. As Bert and Nasi find space for compromise with action rather than language, there is a gesture towards tenderness. In the way they dance and hold each other, there is hope for something kinder. If only our country could have such an elegant outcome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24743531a1d6b61a170fcf3c033402c45296b2cc/220_50_3756_2254/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3a328d422fe4b69579243d0f887da8","title":"microsoft launches surface pro x and previews folding phone","story":"Product bonanza includes bigger Surface Laptop 3, Surface Earbuds and updated Surface Pro 7Microsoft has launched the Surface Pro X, a redesigned thin and light two-in-one Windows 10 PC running on custom ARM chips rather than traditional Intel processors, plus the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3, and previewed a folding phone and dual-screen tablet.The products were unveiled at an event in New York on Wednesday, where Microsoft sought to grab attention from rivals including Apple and Samsung.The Surface Pro X is Microsoft’s next-generation mobile tablet-laptop hybrid. It fits a larger high-resolution 13in screen into the 12in frame of the existing Surface Pro, is only 5.3mm thick at its thinnest point and weighs 762g. It retains the detachable Type Cover keyboard from Microsoft’s existing line, but introduces a new Surface Slim Pen stylus that fits between keyboard and tablet for charging and storage.The biggest change is the use of the Microsoft SQ1 chip instead of Intel chips. The new custom ARM-based processor has an integrated AI engine and was developed with Qualcomm based on mobile device technology but running full Windows 10. Microsoft said the chip is three times more powerful per watt than the processor in the existing Surface Pro 6.“What does that mean? Better battery life, faster, thinner, lighter with unprecedented performance, all while running the full power of Windows, Office, Edge and Chrome,” said Panos Panay, the chief product officer of Microsoft.The new tablet PC also has always-connected 4G, similar to a smartphone, and promises battery life far in excess of traditional Intel computers.The Surface Pro X will start at £999 in the UK and $999 in the US, where it will ship in early November.The Surface Pro 7 will cost from $749 in the US and will ship on 22 October. It will cost £799 in the UK.Microsoft also unveiled updated traditional laptops with a refreshed 13.5in and brand new 15in Surface Laptop 3.The larger 15in Surface Laptop 3 bucks the trend with options for an Ryzen Surface Edition processor made by Intel’s longtime rival AMD, which Microsoft said has the fastest graphics of any laptop in its class.Geoff Blaber of analysts CCS Insight said: “Broadening its silicon partners to include AMD and Qualcomm will inevitably raise eyebrows and cause Intel to look over its shoulder.“The reality is that this is about choice, control and flexibility as Microsoft widens the Surface portfolio to address a growing range of devices and use cases.”Both laptops feature all-day battery life and Microsoft’s new fast-charging technology. They are also repairable, with removable hard drives and other components designed to be easily taken apart.In a clear dig at rival Apple, which has had problems with its laptop keyboards that are difficult to repair, Panay said: “Being able to repair and service a product without impacting the beauty and elegance is critical. Serviceability, repairability, we did things so we can replace the screen or the keyboard without affecting the beauty.”The 13in Surface Laptop 3 costs from $999 and the 15in version costs $1,199 in the US, shipping on 22 October. In the UK it will cost £999 and £1,199.Microsoft also announced a new set of true wireless earbuds, called the Surface Earbuds, which are direct competitors to Apple’s AirPods and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds and join its existing Surface Headphones.The Bluetooth earbuds feature one-clip pairing, multi-device compatibility – meaning they can be used with PCs, phones and tablets from all brands – and have up to 24-hour battery life with a charging case. A dual-mic array in each ear is designed to pick up the user’s voice and cancel the background noise, which was demoed though voice dictation in Office for real-time captions and translation.They also have direct Spotify integration for starting playback without having to reach for the phone on Android, and gesture controls for playback and volume – something missing on many wireless earbuds.The Surface Earbuds will cost $249 later this year in the US.Alongside products due to go on sale this year, Microsoft also took the wraps off two products it is working on for Christmas 2020.The Surface Duo is a two-screen folding phone, which has two 5.6in screens bolted together with a hinge that folds a full 360 degrees. The phone opens like a book then folds all the way round.Microsoft pitched the Surface Duo as having the benefits of a phone, but also a computer on which you can do more because it has two screens. However, with folding devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which have one continuous flexible screen that opens like a book instead of two screens bolted together, the Duo may be out of date before it ships.Panay said the firm had partnered with Google to bring Android apps and the Play Store to the Duo, “bringing the absolute best of Microsoft with the absolute best of Google”.“You’re more productive on two screens, much more than one screen can ever be, but it has to be elegant, it has to be robust,” he said, in a vague reference to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which has had problems with the robustness of its flexible screen.Microsoft also unveiled the Surface Neo, which it said would be the evolution of its Surface computer line. It too has dual screens, with a hinge in the middle, but will run a new version of Microsoft’s operating system called Windows 10X.The firm said the new device will have a detachable keyboard and can be opened like a book, used as two screens or one, used like a laptop with a virtual trackpad on one screen, or folded all the way over. It also supports the Surface Thin Pen, which attaches to the back of the device, and uses a new Intel chip designed to support dual-screen devices. The Surface Neo will be 5.6mm thick and weigh 655g.“I believe this is the next category to adapt to you in form and function, creating unlimited and interrupted flow,” said Panay.However, neither the Surface Duo or Neo will be available until Christmas 2020. More than a year is a long time in technology.Blaber said: “Surface Duo is a bold new category of device and will take time to build developer and carrier support.“The launch of Surface Duo will inevitably draw comparison with its doomed Windows Phone investments. Duo is not without risk, but Microsoft isn’t trying to repeat history and reinvent the wheel. It’s using an established platform to deliver a new category that is optimised for a Microsoft experience.“This is the start of a journey for Microsoft and expectations should be set accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3f6577db93c4fd46f4ebe161096f387bbf1e803/2657_1449_9537_5722/master/9537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21863643efe892599068b8c03608cd86","title":"driverless cars in new london trial in complex urban environment","story":"Self-driving vehicles reach UK milestone with first demo in ‘complex urban environment’ in StratfordWork to bring driverless cars to Britain’s streets has reached a milestone with the first demonstration of an autonomous fleet driving in a “complex urban environment” in London.Ford Mondeos fitted with autonomous technology from the UK tech firm Oxbotica operated on public roads around the former Olympic Park in Stratford this week. Directors of the £13.6m Driven programme, a partially government-funded consortium, said it had “exceeded their initial plan” and was a significant step in confirming autonomous vehicles could operate in real-life situations in a large European city.Oxbotica said first passenger trials of a separate venture, an autonomous ride-sharing taxi service planned with the cab firm Addison Lee in the capital, could now start in June 2020.The Driven team – a combination of local authority planners, insurers, cyber-security and data experts, as well as Oxbotica – have been conducting trials in Oxford to examine what they called the “ecosystem” around autonomous vehicles, such as potential problems with hackers, communications technology and the legal framework.For now, the cars are operated with a safety driver in the front seat ready to take control, and prompted by the technology to decide whether to intervene in difficult situations. On an otherwise autonomous spin around Stratford’s East Village, through A-roads, traffic intersections and residential streets, the safety driver in the ’s car only once opted to grab the wheel as a precaution, when an oncoming minicab swerved around a parked lorry.Dr Graeme Smith, Driven’s programme director and Oxbotica’s senior vice-president, said the project was making “autonomous vehicles a reality on our roads”.He said: “The car is a bauble on top of the iceberg: underpinning that is a host of other things that need to happen, from cybersecurity to ensure we have constant, secure communication insurers for product liability and real-life risk assessment.”Smith added that while there would be “small pockets” of autonomous transport, the constraints meant the cars were “at least five years away from being a service for robotaxis, and 10 years for showrooms.”Prof Paul Newman, the founder and chief technical officer of Oxbotica, said the ambition for the British technology went well beyond driverless cars, with a system removed from GPS tracking and not reliant on maps. He said: “We’re going to change the way people and goods move anywhere and everywhere.”Wider use of autonomy in the mining and construction sectors was likely before transport, he said.If Mondeo Man was once emblematic of a certain type of Briton, some might worry to see the Ford car’s driver supplanted by a computer in the boot and a set of sensors on the roof.George Freeman, the transport minister, said the successful Driven trial “cements our position as a global leader in this space”.Meanwhile, the first public demonstrations of Britain’s first full-size autonomous bus took place in Birmingham, on a test route on the National Exhibition Centre car park. The single-deckers will start trials carrying up to 42 passengers on a 15-mile route between Fife and Edinburgh next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d67f364f92827e5c4d1559471e09da24fe5897a1/1_0_1689_1014/master/1689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da66cad5f76da32e743dcd1eef3b689","title":"can a mini pc and a tv set replace a old laptop","story":"Anthony wants to replace his mother’s old Windows 7 laptop. Would a mini-PC hooked up to her 32in TV work well enough? My retired mother happily uses her iPhone and iPad for the majority of her digital needs, but she uses an old, low-spec Windows 7 laptop for Microsoft Office documents for various committees she sits on, for her music library and digital photos, some web browsing and other tasks that cannot be easily done on a small device.I have a Mac Mini running through a 42in TV set, and we are interested in the feasibility of using a mini PC hooked up to her 32in TV. Target budget is £300 for PC, keyboard and any adaptors.For the OS evangelists among your readers, I use a Mac and I may well repurpose her laptop with Linux, but Mum wants Windows. AntMini or micro PCs are terrific at what they do, as long as you don’t expect them to do too much. They are also potential space-savers because they can be attached to the back of any monitor or TV set that has a standard VESA mount. Anyone unfamiliar with the form factor can read an answer from November 2018, What is the point of mini PCs?However, mini PCs come in at least three overlapping categories. First, there are entry-level models that cost about £100 to £350, and are essentially television set-top boxes. Second, there are desktop replacement minis that are widely used in large businesses for their convenience and space-saving properties. Prices range from £300 to about £1,500.The third category consists of so-called barebones machines that appeal to computer enthusiasts and other people who want to build their own small-format systems. These could be set-top boxes or desktop replacements depending on the parts used. However, they don’t appeal to home users who want an off-the-shelf set-top box for media streaming, and they don’t appeal to businesses, which buy standardised mini PCs in volume from HP, Lenovo and Dell.Your question is about the feasibility of using a (roughly) £250 mini PC hooked up to a 32in TV for Microsoft Office and some other uses, such as managing music and photo libraries. There are a couple of reasons why I don’t think it’s a good idea.The main problem is that it’s not practical to use programs such as Word and Excel at typical TV viewing distances, especially not with such a small TV set. In the old days, interface designers distinguished between “the 3ft experience” of using a computer monitor and “the 10ft experience” of using a TV set. They needed radically different approaches, and different-sized icons and text.Even if we assume the TV set can display small text sharply enough, your mum will need to be around 3ft1 metre from the screen to make it usable. Based on my long experience of watching TV in normal-sized living rooms, I’ll be surprised if this is practical. However, you can easily check this by plugging mum’s current Windows laptop into her TV set.The other problem is your budget. There are plenty of very cheap mini PCs, but their specifications generally include an old and slow Intel Atom processor, 2GB or 4GB of memory, and 32GB of eMMC chip storage, which is pretty much on a par with an SD card. Amazingly enough, machines like this will run Microsoft Office with home-sized documents, but they are underpowered for what your mother needs.Worse, any PC with limited storage – 32GB or 64GB – may run into problems updating Windows 10 twice a year, even though it should be able to handle upgrades by using, say, an external hard drive as temporary storage space. (Presumably your mum already has one for backup purposes. If not, install some kind of backup solution as soon as possible.)Suppliers rarely sell their higher-spec PCs for less than their lower-spec versions, so either I’m missing something or the apparent anomalies won’t last very long.If you buy a mini PC for closer to £200 then you could still come in around your budget price with either of these monitors, as long as your mother can find space for the extra screen.Under the circumstances, you may want to take the easy way out and replace mum’s old laptop with a new laptop. It’s some time since I looked at cheap laptops, and my most recent answer covered laptops costing up to £500. You can still buy “real” laptops for less, but below £300, the experience gets progressively worse.Yes, you can live with a laptop that has limited screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), a slow Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, only 4GB of memory and a traditional hard drive, but you can do dramatically better for not a lot more money.Low specs are a false economy. Today, 8GB of RAM costs about £30, so fitting 4GB instead of 8GB only saves $20 at retail prices. It must save even less at the wholesale prices that HP and Lenovo pay when they are buying more than 1m memory modules a week. At current prices, it’s crazy to buy PCs with only 4GB, unless you plan to add more memory instantly.Have you got a question?

In the US they’re from a pageant background where it’s more about presenting yourself in a very polished way,” he said.Michelle Visage – one of the show’s judges alongside Alan Carr and Graham Norton – said it had taken five years of negotiations to get Drag Race UK to the screen, with the British version launching before an Australian edition due in 2020.In the build up to the show’s launch its line up has been criticised for not being erse enough – with eight of the 10 drag queens in the show being white. “I’ve had a lot of messages saying ‘it’s not erse, it’s not erse’,” says Vinegar Strokes, who along with Sum Ting Wong are the two drag queens of colour on the show.“I think actually you need to come out of the mindset of skin colour and think, is the cast erse in terms of drag? The UK’s drag scene is smaller compared with the US, so you’re not going to get as many queens of colour. So let’s all chill out and enjoy it,” he said.Wong said the fact there will be some representation on the show should be celebrated. “I feel like it shouldn’t be looked down on it should be celebrated. I don’t want to be on the show because of my Chinese-Vietnamese heritage,” he said.Winning the competition can lead to lucrative careers with previous winners Sasha Velour and Bianca Del Rio, going on to build their own brands. “It’s like Dragon’s Den for drag queens. You go in, show what you can do, and then – hopefully – your fee goes up,” said The Vivienne, a drag queen from Liverpool.A key difference between the US and UK shows will be a lack of arguments between contestants that punctuate the original. Divina De Campo, a veteran drag queen from West Yorkshire, said the best series of Drag Race have been where the contestants have embraced “sisterhood and support”. “It’s not all fighting and cutting up each other’s wigs,” he said.Strokes believes the show is a way for drag to infiltrate the British mainstream again. “I think it has always been in the mainstream, if you look back to Dame Edna and Lily Savage, it’s always been there. But having actual drag queens from the scene pushing it on TV is going to take it to another level.”Asked whether the show should be on a primetime slot, the contestants said Drag Race was still too subversive for 7pm on a Saturday. “It’s one of those shows where you can’t do an Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway version of it. You can’t X Factor drag. It has to be in place where you show what you do rather than being judged by the general public,” said Strokes. “People need to watch and learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f0b275cd72cdacb315adb0509f5a88a35878f8b/0_612_1677_1006/master/1677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84ffb5593406a34d29554aa4deebac8d","title":"santa cruz kidnapping tushar atre","story":"Police say Tushar Atre was kidnapped from his California home around 3am and officers located vehicle that afternoonThe 50-year-old owner of a California marketing company was abducted from his oceanfront home in Santa Cruz and later found dead near his white BMW, authorities say.The Santa Cruz county sheriff’s office has released few details on the case.

Missiles fired from underwater are also harder to detect before liftoff than ground-based missiles.The KCNA state news agency said the test, in waters off its east coast, marked a “new phase” in containing the threat from “outside forces” – although it did specify the nature of that threat.Ankit Panda of the Federation of American Scientists described the missile, the Pukguksong-3, as Pyongyang’s longest-range-capable solid-fuel missile, adding that Wednesday’s launch was “unambiguously the first nuclear-capable missile test since November 2017”.“Kim Jong Un’s ‘rocket men’ kept busy during the diplomatic charm offensives of 2018-2019,” Panda added.It isn’t clear if the missile was launched from a submarine, barge or some form of underwater platform.Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, wrote on Facebook that the missile was probably fired from a specially built underwater barge. He said the missile is under development and that North Korea must test-fire it from a submarine before it can be deployed.North Korea began testing SLBMs in 2015 and conducted four submarine launches by August 2016, when a two-stage solid-fuel Pukguksong missile flew about 500 km (310 miles) on a lofted trajectory. That test was considered a success.The launch may be used as leverage in talks with the US due to resume at the weekend after months of stalemate, and with Pyongyang warning recently that engagement with Washington could unravel unless it comes up with new proposals by the end of the year.Pyongyang has said that denuclearisation measures are contingent on the US making reciprocal actions, including the lifting of sanctions.Kim Myong-gil, a former North Korean ambassador to Vietnam who will lead the North Korean delegation, arrived in Beijing on Thursday before flying to Stockholm, where the talks will take place, Kyodo news agency said, citing diplomatic sources.South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said the missile travelled about 450km (280 miles) in an easterly direction at a maximum altitude of 910km.Photos of the launch in the official newspaper Rodong Sinmun showed a black-and-white painted missile emerging from the water and flying into the grey sky.The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, “sent warm congratulations” to those who had carried out the successful test-firing, KCNA said, indicating that Kim was not at the site. A State Department spokeswoman called on Pyongyang to “refrain from provocations” and to remain committed to the nuclear negotiations.South Korea expressed strong concern and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, condemned the launch, saying it was a violation of UN security council resolutions.North Korea rejects those resolutions that ban Pyongyang from using ballistic missile technology, saying they are an infringement of its right to self-defence.The launch was the ninth since Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, met at the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas in June, and came soon after Pyongyang announced it would hold working-level talks with the US on Saturday – a development that could potentially break months of stalemate over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.Talks aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have been stalled since the second summit between Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February ended without a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2204dd6df26a106b43ab91b19a523aba91f3a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6b000852294a3a46ba57b2e4b628ed0","title":"ok sign gesture emoji rightwing alt right","story":"The media has been manipulated by extremists but focusing on the victims offers journalists a way to redress the balanceAnother day, another seemingly harmless symbol you can’t use without appearing to be a purveyor of hate.The alt-right’s latest trophy is the OK hand sign, which was officially recognised as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League over the weekend. And on Tuesday, it was reported that a Universal Orlando Resort employee was fired after concerned parents found a photo of him making the hand sign on their six-year-old’s shoulder (their child is biracial and has autism).The OK sign joins a number of surprising symbols co-opted by the alt-right, such as the milk emoji, Pepe the frog and even, at one point, Taylor Swift.She explains how these media manipulators see an opportunity – for example, when something goes viral or becomes popular – and choose it as a moment to insert themselves into the conversation. In the case of the Facebook “Trash Doves” sticker, for example, 4chan users noticed the cartoon go viral and sent out the rallying cry: “Let’s make this normie meme a Nazi symbol!”With this process, they flex their muscles, showing that what the Lord giveth, the alt-right can take away. And it’s done through elaborate means, too: with Trash Doves, 4chan-users began to photoshop swastikas on to the viral Facebook cartoon. Sometimes they’re even more sophisticated, creating fake content cards like that of the ADL’s. They circulate the content online through social media, leaving it out as bait for undiscerning journalists who perpetuate the hoax by writing about it as if it is an authentic hate-threat.“This is their trick: they are hoping journalists will uncritically look at the OK symbol, find these infographics that claim it stands for white power and then write about it. The trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled,” says Donovan.“These become symbols of hate pretty much exclusively because of journalistic coverage,” says Wendy Phillips, who wrote This is Why We Can’t Have Nice things: Mapping the Relationship between Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture.Ultimately, this a game about power: if rightwing trolls can make the so-called liberal media look gullible, then it has a delegitimising effect, supporting the idea that journalists are oversensitive, easily triggered snowflakes. Soon enough, the news begins to feels like it belongs to a parody website rather than real life.“What memes do is they create in-groups and out-groups. The in-groups know it’s satirical, the out-groups think it’s something to fear,” says Donovan. ﻿Part of the effect is to make you think that white supremacists could be everywhere, hiding in plain sight. If someone as important as the president could be one of them – Trump likes to flash the gesture when he speaks – who else is? Heck, maybe you’re a white supremacist, because the last time you sent an OK emoji you were unwittingly signalling your belief in the superiority of the white race.At some point, life begins to imitate their art, and what began as a media hoax takes on dangerously radical connotations. This point came when the Australian man charged with killing 51 people at mosques in New Zealand, made the OK gesture during a courtroom appearance after being arrested.Phillips says even if stories written about these memes are incredulous or mocking, they might help the cause, since media attention is what those groups are after.“Many of us tend to be very fascinated in the bad guys themselves which is understandable but they are the smallest part of the story,” she says.So what does this mean for journalists? Phillips argues that media organisations can’t ever truly separate themselves from the amplification of white nationalists if they have to report on them.Instead, she advocates for the media to shift the camera away from the white supremacists and focus on its real victims. That means looking at its impact on minority communities in places like Texas, and on the people who live in the small towns that neo-Nazis turn up in. It means highlighting the toxic resentment of women that the patriarchal ideology of white nationalism results in, and what it feels like for a mother to have white supremacists take her daughter away.Ultimately, it means reporting the news but in a different way, says Phillips: “I don’t think the media shouldn’t tell the truth, you should just tell a bigger truth: about the impact of these behaviours, instead of just reporting on the genesis of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15a7fbe7e732ad9b152062a41480289f43ef76f/0_265_5043_3025/master/5043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd3cdef7870886d43053591dfbb6f329","title":"portugal election europes beacon of social democracy heads to the polls","story":"After four years of relative stability, Socialist leader António Costa seeks re-election For the past four years, the imposing São Bento palace, seat of Portugal’s parliament, has been the scene of one of the more unlikely feats of European governance.While populist parties have erupted at both ends of the political spectrum elsewhere across the continent, Portugal has proved an enduring, if improbable, beacon of social democracy.Although the rightwing Portugal Ahead coalition, led by pro-austerity then prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho, took the most votes in the October 2015 general election, its minority government lasted a mere 11 days.It was toppled by the socialist leader, António Costa, thanks to a promise to “turn the page on austerity” and a jury-rigged, non-coalition alliance with the far-left.Since then, Costa and his backers in the Left Bloc and Communist parties have confounded expectations by holding together their unprecedented deal, known as the geringonça – or improvised solution.They have also brought political and economic stability to a country that received a €78bn bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during the financial crisis eight years ago.As Portugal prepares to vote in Sunday’s general election, Costa is hoping that his track record will win him another term in office.The polls suggest his Socialist party (PS) will win the election but fall short of an absolute majority in parliament.Speaking in Coimbra this week, Costa said his party had “torn down the wall of incommunicability” between the Portuguese left and paved the way for the country’s recovery.Without the PS government, he added, Portugal would not have managed to “turn the page on austerity, regain international credibility, maintain investor confidence, reduce inequalities and balance the books”.Costa has argued that a “strong PS” is needed to keep things on track and has warned that a surge in support for the Left Bloc could lead to the kind of impasse seen in Spain, where the socialist party’s inability to reach a deal with the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos has triggered the country’s fourth election in as many years.André Azevedo Alves, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Portugal and St Mary’s University, London, said Costa’s main domestic achievement has been to deliver four years of relatively stable government.“Most people didn’t think the government would last more than one or two years,” he said.“Political stability is one of the big factors that Costa and the Socialists have on their side. There was also a very high level of scepticism about a socialist government, with parliamentary support from the far left, being able to comply with the public finance objectives established by the European Union.”Costa’s other successes include raising the minimum wage to €600 a month, reversing civil service cuts and reducing unemployment.Externally, added Azevedo Alves, Costa has been able to keep the traditional social democratic party as the main party “at a time when the traditional centre-left parties are in deep trouble – or, in some places, have almost disappeared”.Despite all the talk of the “Portuguese miracle”, however, Costa’s administration has hardly been immune to criticism, mistakes, scandal or corruption.Underfunding of public services such as education and healthcare has provoked strikes and anger, while the government’s handling of the 2017 forest fires that killed more than 100 people was bitterly criticised and led to the resignation of the interior minister.Meanwhile, Costa’s former defence minister, José Azeredo Lopes, is to be tried over his alleged role in a suspected cover-up of a weapons theft at a military base two years ago.Perhaps most damaging of all though, are the corruption charges faced by José Sócrates, Portugal’s socialist prime minister from 2005 to 2011.He is accused of pocketing €34m through top-level corruption and has been charged with corruption in public office, money laundering, forgery and tax fraud.“Large segments of the electorate would regard Costa as skilled and politically able but perhaps not necessarily the most trustworthy leader,” said Azevedo Alves.“That explains the socialists’ substantial lead in the polls but their lack of a clear majority in parliament.”If, as expected, a majority eludes the socialists, they could reactivate the geringonça, again relying on the support of the Left Bloc and Communist party from outside government.But if the PS finds itself closer to a majority than had been anticipated, it could instead turn to the small but growing green People-Animals-Nature (PAN) party, which is less ideologically fixed than the far-left groups.Whatever happens, though, and despite the protests and scandals, Costa and his allies have shown that the geringonça has evolved from being a punchline to a resilient and effective political machine.“It has worked well it has produced political stability,” said Costa Lobo. “Economics trumps policy overall and ensures the PS will win.”Azevedo Alves also sees a definite shift in the public mood. “In 2015, people were thinking we’ll be bankrupt again a year from now,” he said.“I think there’s an idea within a large sector of the electorate that things haven’t been wonderful but they have gone pretty well. It has certainly all been above most people’s expectations.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Party outlines \u0026euro1.1 billion investment in sustainable transport for 2020A clear Government plan on asylum needed to prevent spread of \u0026lsquopopulist, racist agenda\u0026rsquoBritish prime minister says proposals made a \u0026lsquogenuine attempt to bridge chasm\u0026lsquoThroughout history vulnerable people have had to flee their homes\u0026rsquoNew figures show 85,517 applications in first eight months of year amid Brexit fearsSarah Ewart speaks of \u0026lsquoemotional relief\u0026rsquo after judgment made in judicial reviewStudents at Col\u0026aacuteiste L\u0026uacute unit say reduction in teaching through Irish has affected exam preparationOne adult and three juvenile males held by gardai over July incident in Co Wexford townOrange alert in place for five counties with gusts of up to 120km per hour forecastMore than 20 people may be prosecuted relating to inquiryStakeknife stands accused of overseeing the murder of alleged IRA informersGovernment and EU to engage with UK on backstop proposalsLong road from animal trials to trials on humans, let alone bringing drugs to marketChief veterinary officer has warned that resources are finite and demand for export certs may exceed supplyGovernment and EU to engage with UK on backstop proposalsReports of Government tensions over next year\u0026rsquos education budget due to costs of pay, pensionsPaschal Donohoe is likely to announce environmental health surcharge, sources saySe\u0026aacuten O\u0026rsquoKeeffe died of an overdose after \u0026lsquodesperately\u0026rsquo seeking psychiatric helpMet \u0026Eacuteireann says likelihood of landfall \u0026lsquohigh probability\u0026rsquo and warns of flooding"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4038228.1570050932!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo s gas announcement eclipses boris s hot air","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Taoiseach’s big-ticket lecterns – three of them – were rolled out in a line at the bottom of the steps in front of Government Buildings, signifying this was not a Richard Bruton gig anymore.   Photograph:  Laura HuttonLeader’s Questions came and went without a reference to Boris or Brexit.Keeping their powder dry on all sides.It was a question of timing. The British prime minister was still on his feet performing his keynote stand-up routine at the Tory Party conference when Leo Varadkar and his opposition counterparts commenced their midday joust in the Dáil chamber.The Taoiseach’s presence was required. But it was interesting to see his Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs present too, as opposed to glued to the television upstairs watching Boris Johnson’s speech. Simon Coveney sat by Leo’s side for well over an hour. For much of the time they were the only cabinet members on the front bench. As the Taoiseach took questions on housing, healthcare and bailed-out banks, a pensive-looking Coveney, fidgety fingers interlocking and steepling, seemed miles away. Would anybody mention the B words? The PM’s knockabout act in Manchester was well finished by the time Leo escaped the chamber. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was already in the canteen, leisurely perusing the hot counter and having the chats.There was an air of calm about the two men in Leinster House. It was as if they weren’t expecting any surprises from across the water, during or after Johnson’s address. Meanwhile, an announcement by Richard Bruton about a major renewable energy collaboration between Ireland and France, which had been scheduled for the Italian Room in Government Buildings, moved up the news agenda. Enterprise Minister Heather Humphreys was now going “to deliver an important message for businesses on financial supports available for Brexit” at this media opportunity.‘Subject to his availability’And then the bit which had the television news crews and political correspondents erting to Merrion Street. “The Taoiseach may also attend subject to his availability.”Who knew there would be such interest – national and international – in the news that the Irish government has been given a big EU grant towards the billion euro “Celtic Interconnector” electricity link? Whatever that might be.The Italian Room went out the window. The Taoiseach’s big-ticket lecterns – three of them – were rolled out in a line at the bottom of the steps in front of Government Buildings, signifying this was not a Richard Bruton gig anymore. Soon after 2pm, ministers Bruton and Humphreys swept down the red-carpeted stairs and through the main doors, flanking the fortuitously available Taoiseach. He took the middle lectern and made the announcement Richard would have made without the drama or audience.Leo declared there is to be a monumental exchange of wind between Ireland and France. Far more wind than has ever been exchanged between Ireland and Britain, which will be very important post-Brexit. “By connecting Ireland’s electricity grid to that of France and continental Europe, it means that when the wind is blowing in Ireland we can export it to the continent and when it is not blowing in Ireland but is blowing in other parts of continental Europe it can be exported to us,” the Taoiseach explained. This Celtic Interconnector is a very expensive piece of engineering. Around a billion, give or take. That’s more than half the cost of the interconnector, he pointed out unnecessarily. Isn’t Europe great all the same? Why, Mr Junker, with all these millions you are spoiling us.Richard Bruton filled in some more detail. At the moment, our energy standby capacity is reliant on the existing interconnection with England. “And it’s smaller – it’s only 500 megawatts and this will be 700 megawatts.” The underwater electricity connection will link Ireland with France and, all going to plan, could be ready in around six years’ time. Once the UK leaves the EU, the interconnector goes too. This Franco-Irish link will hook up Ireland with the EU’s energy market post-Brexit. It represents “solidarity with the rest of the European Union”, said Richard, and will result in cheaper and greener electricity. “I would like to thank all of you who have played such an important part,” said the Minister, including “RTÉ”. What? No wonder they’re talking about having to sell Lyric. He hastily explained the billion-euro project is a joint venture between EirGrid and its French energy counterpart, Réseau de Transport d’Électricité (RTÉ).Get cracking Heather Humphreys then reminded businesses to get cracking before the effects of Brexit take hold, by applying for support funding through the Brexit Loan Scheme – there’s hundreds of millions available in Brexit insulation. Speaking of which (it was the reason the Taoiseach crashed the Richard’s interconnector party), Leo was still coming to terms with the leak of the “non-papers” at the beginning of the week, purporting to outline the UK’s final negotiating position on the Backstop. “Not very promising,” he said.Was there anything in Boris Johnson’s conference speech signalling possible movement? “I actually didn’t have a chance to hear Prime Minister Johnson’s speech. I was in the chamber taking questions myself.” In the chamber with his Foreign Minister beside him. It meant neither of them could comment on the latest Brexit musings emanating from Boris in Manchester. As for the leaks in those non-papers, Leo couldn’t really comment on them either as he didn’t see the non-papers concerned. However, the Fianna Fáil leader winkled out an interesting nugget of information from the Taoiseach during later questions, when few where paying attention. As Leo was sticking by his lack of knowledge of the British position and publicly remaining aloof from the current state of play between the EU and the UK, it transpired he knew a lot more than he was letting on. Had he been given a briefing from Number 10 on the leaked non-papers?“I can confirm that two of prime minister Johnson’s aides visited Dublin and came yesterday morning to Government Buildings, where they gave my officials and advisers a verbal briefing on the UK Government’s proposals,” replied the Taoiseach. He never said that on Tuesday afternoon when the subject was broached in the Dáil. Leo didn’t want to comment on any proposals due from the British “until I have had a chance to see them and study them”.“You know what they are, though,” surmised Micheál.This caper is far from over."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4038914.1570102194!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"asylum applications up 53 per cent as direct provision centres reach capacity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJim O’Callaghan said it was apparent some people would opportunistically go to places like Oughterard, “for the purposes of drumming up a racist agenda”.

Asylum applications have increased by 53 per cent in the first nine months of this year and almost 1,400 asylum seekers are being housed in emergency accommodation, the Dáil has heard.Minister of State David Stanton said that “due to an unexpected rise in applications, figures are up 53 per cent” up to the end of September. He said that direct provision centres had reached capacity and there was an ongoing effort through a tender process to find further centres of accommodation.He said there are 1,389 applicants in 34 emergency accommodations centres around the country.And there are 855 people with permission to remain in the State who have remained in direct accommodation.Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan, who raised the issue, said, “fortunately in this country we’ve avoided the worst excesses of far right politics. “Just because we’ve avoided it in the past doesn’t mean we’re always going to be able to avoid it in the future and there are people out there who are opportunistically trying to use this issue for their own political right-wing agenda.”He said it was apparent some people would opportunistically go to places like Oughterard, “for the purposes of drumming up a racist agenda”.The developer of a hotel in the town which was earmarked to open as a direct provision centre withdrew his tender this week. The Dublin Bay South TD said one way to prevent the spread of this “populist and racist appeal” is if the Government has a clear plan in place as to how people seeking asylum are going to be accommodated into the future.He suggested they look at State-owned accommodation and to also consider fostering as an option.“There are many well-intentioned people in this country who want to help people seeking asylum.”Mr Stanton said there were 38 centres working very well and the local communities had welcomed people who have integrated well and worked on ventures such as tidy towns.He said they had looked at State-owned properties.They had improved standards enormously and almost half of residents have self-catering accommodation and many have their “own door”.

More than 34,000 tonnes of the Irish product was exported there in 2018.  File photograph: Getty Irish food and beverage products including Kerrygold and Baileys are to be hit by a new 25 per cent tariff by the United States.The Trump administration unveiled plans to tax EU imports following a WTO ruling on Wednesday.In a blow to Irish and European food exporters, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced it would impose tariffs of 25 per cent on a range of food products including butter, cheese, pork and several drink products, including liqueurs such as Baileys.However, while whiskey from Scotland and Northern Ireland – including Bushmills – will be hit, it appears that Irish whiskey has been exempted from the tariffs.The decision was announced hours after the United States was given the green light to impose $7.5 billion (€6.84 billion) worth of tariffs on European exports.The Geneva-based WTO issued its judgment in the long-running trade dispute, ruling that the United States could impose trade measures worth up to $7.5 billion over what it has said are unfair subsidies given to Airbus.It marks the largest ever ruling by the international trade body.Ireland’s butter and liqueur exporters will be among the businesses affected by the ruling, with the new tariffs due to come into effect on October 18th.Apparent exemptionHowever, the apparent exemption for whiskey from the Republic of Ireland will be welcomed, given that the US is Ireland’s primary export market for whiskey.The tariffs on butter will likely hit Kerrygold, which is the second-most popular butter brand in the United States. More than 34,000 tonnes of the Irish product was exported there in 2018.An analysis by Ibec earlier this year found that Irish goods would be the most exposed, on a per capita basis, to the proposed US tariffs on EU goods, noting that €818 million worth of products would be hit. “Given that the food and drink sector makes up two-thirds of the exports of indigenous firms, there is potential here for significant knock-on impacts on the domestic economy,” the association writes in its most recent economic outlook.‘Big win’Speaking at a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said that the WTO ruling was a “big win for the United States”.“The WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been president because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States,” he said of the decades-long dispute.The WTO is due to rule on a parallel case brought by the EU against US support for Boeing early next year. The EU has warned that it will be forced to retaliate over the new tariffs.Incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said during his confirmation hearing in Brussels this week that Europe “has to stand up for itself” and should identify American products that could be hit in retaliatory action if the US imposed the sanctions.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be.

(Elisa Bray)“While I want nothing more than to bring my show to fans in Saudi Arabia, after better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression,” Minaj said in a statement.Around a dozen Saudi women activists have been detained for the past year on charges related to human rights work and contacts with foreign journalists and diplomats.It is a case that has drawn global attention, particularly after last year’s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit. The argument goes that firms can let workers go if their sales drop, whereas investment in machinery is a more permanent expense.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It appears to have been doing so as far as back as 10 billion years ago, when it was just forming, and those faint traces of smaller galaxies can still be seen to this day.Astronomers hope that the research can shed light on how our own galaxy will eventually be swallowed, and how it will come to its end. But it also opens up new mysteries about why and how Andromeda is destroying the galaxies that surround it.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe Milky Way is on a collision course with Andromeda in about four billion years. So knowing what kind of a monster our galaxy is up against is useful in finding out the Milky Way\u0027s ultimate fate, said Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspAustralian National University\u0027s\u0026nbspResearch School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.Andromeda has a much bigger and more complex stellar halo than the Milky Way, which indicates that it has cannibalised many more galaxies, possibly larger ones.Huge ‘structures’ found floating in spaceTo piece together that ancient story, which is published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, researchers looked at dense clumps of stars that are known as\u0026nbspglobular clusters. Those show the signs of the ancient feasts, during which Andromeda would swallow its closer neighbours.That allowed them to see the fossils of long-dead galaxies, using them to understand the galaxies as they were when they lived, in the same way that fossils on Earth could shed light on ancient lives and deaths.By tracing the faint remains of these smaller galaxies with embedded star clusters, we\u0027ve been able to recreate the way Andromeda drew them in and ultimately enveloped them at the different times, Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the study helps answer important questions about the fate of our galaxy, it also opens up new questions and mysteries. Scientists say that Andromeda\u0027s two rounds of feeding came from entirely different directions.This is very weird and suggests that the extragalactic meals are fed from what\u0027s known as the \u0027cosmic web\u0027 of matter that threads the universe, said Professor Lewis from the Sydney Institute for Astronomy and University of Sydney School of Physics, who co-led the study with Dr Mackey.More surprising is the discovery that the direction of the ancient feeding is the same as the bizarre \u0027plane of satellites\u0027, an unexpected alignment of dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda.Those planes can be torn up by Andromeda\u0027s own gravity within the space of a few billion years, according to previous research by the same scientists.This deepens the mystery as the plane must be young, but it appears to be aligned with ancient feeding of dwarf galaxies. Maybe this is because of the cosmic web, but really, this is only speculation, Professor Lewis said.We\u0027re going to have to think quite hard to unravel what this is telling us.Astronomers also hope that the discovery could help us to learn more about our own galaxy, and how it will continue to evolve.One of our main motivations in studying astronomy is to understand our place in the Universe. A way of learning about our galaxy is to study others that are similar to it, and try to understand how these systems formed and evolved.\u0026nbspSometimes this can actually be easier than looking at the Milky Way, because we live inside it and that can make certain types of observations quite difficult.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month. The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit.

And then it helped him rebuild his image after the journalist’s murder, reports Richard HallThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi was supposed to be quiet. The Saudi officials behind the brutal slaying had planned everything meticulously. He would disappear without a trace.\u0026nbspThe killers wanted nothing to disturb their boss’s ambitious reform drive at home. The young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was trying to transform his country. He had spent the past two years courting the international community as part of his grand vision to modernise the kingdom and attract foreign investment. He gave Saudis new freedoms, but he also cracked down harder than ever on dissent.\u0026nbspHundreds of millions of dollars were spent on promoting the crown prince\u0026nbspand his reforms. A vast global public relations offensive courted world leaders and celebrities.\u0026nbspAnd it appeared to be working – up until Khashoggi disappeared. When it emerged that the dissident journalist had been murdered inside the Saudi consulate, likely on behalf of the crown prince, that carefully crafted image was ruined, and the royal\u0026nbspfound himself in the centre of a global scandal that threatened to derail all of his plans.An army of public relations firms was\u0026nbspnow faced with an impossible task: to save the image of a man whom many now regarded as a brutal murderer. One year on from Khashoggi’s killing, they may just have done it. \u0026nbspThe fallout from the Khashoggi killing was unexpected, but the crown prince’s\u0026nbspvast PR network was already on a war footing when the scandal broke.\u0026nbspA year earlier, the Saudi information ministry announced a global campaign “to promote the changing face of KSA to the rest of the world”. This network of lobbyists and public relations experts had been working furiously to counter bad press from Saudi Arabia’s devastating war in Yemen and its blockade of Qatar. Most of it, however, was working to promote the crown prince.\u0026nbspIn early 2018, the royal embarked on a high-profile media tour of the US –\u0026nbspbilled as a coming out party after assuming de-facto leadership of Saudi Arabia from his father. He held meetings with President Donald Trump, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, Hollywood stars, Wall Street financiers and Oprah Winfrey, to name a few. He appeared on the flagship news programme 60 Minutes\u0026nbspfor a sit-down interview, and attracted faint praise from columnists in\u0026nbspThe New York Times.\u0026nbspThat trip was followed by a similarly loud visit to London.

The kingdom also hired a host of London firms, including Consulum, largely staffed by former employees of Bell Pottinger, and Freuds.\u0026nbspThe aim was “to present an image of KSA as striding towards reform, detoxify the government to reduce international political pressure, attract investment for economic growth, and open up foreign tourism”, says Professor Hardy.\u0026nbspBut not everyone was convinced. Many saw the PR push as just that, including Khashoggi himself. Nikita Bernardi, a PR consultant who works on human rights cases in the Middle East, remembers discussing the prince’s plans with Khashoggi. \u0026nbsp“He and I were having this conversation in the days before his killing,” she says. “Almost exactly a year ago I was in Washington DC organising a conference, the aim of which was to question this new face of Saudi Arabia they were trying to promote. Jamal Khashoggi was one of the speakers.”“The PR campaign felt so extremely superficial. It was almost designed for western countries that needed him to look more palatable so that they can continue the status quo and sell arms and the rest of it. They needed him to look like he was changing things in the right direction.”\u0026nbspJamal Khashoggi during a press conference in\u0026nbsp2014. Saudi Arabian officials murdered Khashoggi, a dissident and journalist (AFP)At the very moment Khashoggi was airing his doubts about whether the crown prince was really a true reformer\u0026nbsp– in private and in public – the royal’s top advisers were plotting to kill the journalist.Khashoggi went missing on 2 October after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He had gone there to collect papers so that he could marry his fiancee, who waited for him outside. He was never seen again.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia initially insisted that Khashoggi had left the consulate, but after a steady stream of leaks by Turkish investigators, it changed the story, saying the 59-year-old was killed there in a “fist fight”.Turkish and international investigators later said that Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate and his body disposed of. Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur leading an independent human rights inquiry into the killing, said the murder was “planned and perpetrated by Saudi officials”.\u0026nbspBut the trail of evidence led all the way to the crown prince himself. The CIA and some western countries believe the crown prince ordered the killing – something he has continued to deny.\u0026nbspIn trying to silence Khashoggi, his murderers had the opposite effect. The journalist’s disappearance sparked a firestorm that engulfed the crown prince. Donald Trump, who had been close to the Saudi royal, described the attempts to deny the killing as the “worst in the history of cover-ups.”MBS speaks about his role in the murder of Jamal KhashoggiThe murder derailed the crown prince’s carefully crafted rebrand. In the weeks that followed, as the crown prince was directly accused of involvement, a number of companies and leaders distanced themselves from the kingdom. London-based Freuds and Pagefield Global Counsel announced they were no longer working with the country, in addition to Milltown Partners, which was run by a former head of communications for Prince Charles.PR Week reported that Gladstone Place Partners, Glover Park Group, BGR, Portland Communications, and Gibson, Dunn \u0026amp Crutcher all ended their work for the Saudi government.But though the kingdom lost much of its PR strength, the firms that stuck around “went into overdrive”, Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence for the Centre\u0026nbspfor International Policy, told\u0026nbspThe Washington Post.\u0026nbspThose firms included Qorvis Communications, a US-based crisis communications company, and its parent company, MSL, which has worked with the Saudi government for nearly two decades. According to The Washington Post, MSL has received more than $18m from the Saudi government since October 2018.\u0026nbspThe Saudi government also signed a new $120,000-a-month contract with Karv Communications earlier this year, according to the Financial Times, to “enhance the reputation and image” of the country’s Public Investment Fund, which is headed by the crown prince.With the royal under suspicion for the killing, the strategy of the PR firms changed, according to Professor Hardy. The incessant focus on the crown prince\u0026nbspwas replaced by more targeted persuasion.“The Saudi government sent out senior envoys to persuade key figures in media, politics and business of the sincerity of the investigation into the killing, and to carry out slow, discrete work to stabilise and rebuild confidence,” he says. \u0026nbsp“We are currently seeing a multi-pronged effort. KSA is investing in ‘soft power’ influence such as sports and tourism. Efforts to influence wider public perceptions through such things as sports investment have led to the charge of sportswashing,” he says.\u0026nbspProfessor Hardy points to the upcoming boxing rematch between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz for the world heavyweight title that will be held in the kingdom.\u0026nbspKhashoggi (AFPGetty)On Friday, just days ahead of the anniversary of Khashoggi’s killing, the government announced a new tourist visa programme for 49 countries.\u0026nbspAnd, one year after Khashoggi’s murder, the crown prince is making a return to the spotlight. On Saturday, he\u0026nbspappeared on 60 Minutes again. In the interview, he denied any personal involvement in the killing.\u0026nbsp“This was a heinous crime,” he said. “But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by iniduals working for the Saudi government.”\u0026nbsp“I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch,” he said.\u0026nbspBernardi, the PR consultant, says the interview marks a new strategy.\u0026nbsp“There is only so much that could have been done to protect his reputation. The damage was so great. In the whole year since Jamal has died you can see how the Saudi story has changed. First it was deny, deny, deny, then they said it was rogue agents, now we have the crown prince saying ‘it happened under my watch’.”That is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It’s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing\u0026nbsp“That is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It’s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing.”\u0026nbspAgnes Callamard, the UN’s expert on summary executions whose investigation found “credible evidence” linking the crown prince to the murder, told Reuters that his remarks amount to a “strategy of rehabilitation in the face of public outrage around the world”.“He is creating a distance between himself, he is exonerating himself from direct criminal responsibility in the killing. He is creating layers, and layers and layers of actors and institutions, which are protecting him from his direct accountability for the killing.”There are signs, however, that the international community has already moved on from the killing and is perfectly happy to let the crown prince back into the fold. After initially linking the royal to the murder, the Trump administration has made it clear that it would not affect\u0026nbspthe US-Saudi relationship in any meaningful way.\u0026nbspNext year, Saudi Arabia will host the G20 summit in Riyadh, where the crown prince\u0026nbspis likely to take centre stage. But while states will likely continue to do business with Saudi Arabia, it is unlikely that the the royal’s image will ever fully recover.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“But such attempts have largely been undercut by Saudi Arabia’s ever-worsening human rights record, including the detention and targeting of dissidents, systematic torture, mass executions, and a lack of accountability for Jamal Khashoggi.”“We have seen increasing international pressure on Saudi Arabia, including two landmark joint statements at the UN, a US house resolution and a UK court ruling.“While these measures have not always been sufficiently followed up by respective governments, and clearly much further pressure is needed, the time for business as usual is over.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Around  years ago, as co-presenter of BBC’s live TV show Crimewatch Daily, I interviewed a man called Mick North.Mr North was a lecturer in biochemistry at Stirling University in Scotland and, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, his we Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer and died just two and a half years later – leaving him with a toddler to bring up alone.On March , , he dropped Sophie – by then aged five – at school and headed off to work.The school was Dunblane Primary and she was shot dead by social misfit Thomas Hamilton who, armed with the four guns and  cartridges he owned legally, massacred  pupils and one teacher.In , after writing a book about the tragedy, Mr North came on the show to tell his heart-breaking story and to explain why, in , he had joined the Gun Control Network to campaign for tighter vetting.Sympathising with a man who had lost his daughter in such unconscionable circumstances, I simply said something along the lines of, “I’m not surprised” – a comment seized upon as “partisan” by the gun lobby, who then bombarded the BBC with complaints.The next day I was forced to apologise on air.Yes, it’s important that those presenting on the BBC are seen to be impartial when discussing politics but, be it Naga, citing her own experiences of racism or, in my case, sympathising with a man asking for tighter gun laws after his young daughter was shot dead, these are human reactions that should be judged using common sense, not boiler-plate rules.IN Debbie Harry’s compelling memoir, Face It, she writes about the time David Bowie was backstage with her and rock star Iggy Pop.She says: “David pulled out his c*ck – asI were the official c*ck checker or something.“He loved to pull it out, with both men and women.

But in the case of the traditional media, he mustn’t wield the loss of his mother as a weapon to try to shut down valid criticism that questions why, for example, he preaches about climate change one day then climbs aboard a private jet the next.Princess Diana was media savvy and close friends with several influential journalists.In his recent memoir, former Vogue publisher Nicholas Coleridge relayed the story of a lunch they shared that he had gone to great s to keep secret.But as she left, he says four photographers, “sprang forward, taking a thousand snaps”.Another example of “Diana, the hunted” perhaps Later, Coleridge rang a newspaper friend to ask how the picture desk had known and got the reply: “Diana rang herself from her car, on her way to lunch. She often tips them off about where she’ll be.”Equally, on the night of her death, she was safely ensconced in the Paris Ritz but chose, at midnight, to leave in a car being driven by a man three times over the French drink-driving limit.That is not to say the media — and, in particular, the paparazzi — didn’t sometimes step out of line, but unlike her youngest son, Diana knew not to judge all by the actions of a few.Presumably, the Sussexes hope The Mail on Sunday will cave in before it gets to court, but the paper is insisting it will defend the action “vigorously”.If so, Thomas Markle will be the star witness, and potentially Meghan herself — an event that will draw far more publicity to the Duchess’s turbulent family background than any article we have all long forgotten about.During the South Africa tour, Harry told -year-old student Peter Oki he was so overwhelmed by the world’s problems that it was sometimes hard to get out of bed in the mornings.Perhaps he should try embarking on a tour of the UK, where millions of his subjects are coping with issues without the cushion of wealth and privilege he enjoys.Hard-working people who, after the daily grind of keeping their head above water, simply don’t have time to obsess over perceived slights.Of course, there is one sure-fire route to greater privacyHarry and Meghan desire it.Give up the royal title , get a full-time job and pay for your own house renovations, like the rest of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No peace!Sherfs deputies then cleared the hallway outside the courtroom before more officers escorted Guygers family out and down a side staircase.The shooting drew widespread attention in the US because of the strange circumstances and as it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white cops.In emotional testimony last week, Guyger said she blasted the -year-old because she thought he was a burglar and feared for her le.Jurors had to decideGuyger had a valid defence under Texas’ so-called “castle doctrine - which gives people the right to defend their own home.The -year-old had claimed she parked on the wrong floor of the complex by mistake and entered Jean’s flat, thinking it was hers.She was fired from the Dallas police department and indicted on a murder charge shortly after the shooting.The aftermath of the killing was captured on bodycam footage after fellow officers were called.Jurors were shown the disturbing scenes at the ongoing murder trial of the former Dallas cop.Armed officers are seen sprinting up four flights of stairs to the scene of the shooting.When the cops enter the flat, Guyger says: I thought it was my apartment...I thought it was my apartment.The officers then start performing CPR on the shooting victim saying come on Jean, come on Jean.For more than seven minutes they fought to save his le as he lay bleeding on his lounge floor.Jeans mother, sister and other family members left the courtroom just before the video was played.Guyger was tired after working  hours in four days and was on autopilot, her defence attorney Robert Rogers told jurors.The prosecution, however, alleged Guyger, a five-year veteran of the force, missed numerous signs she was on the wrong floor and in the wrong apartment - including a red doormat and clutter in the kitchen.They also claimed she then failed to adequately try to save Jean after shooting him.Despite being in the hallway when officers arrived, Guyger has said she provided first aid to Jean, according to an affidavit.It was also claimed Guyger was more concerned with her own le and career than she was with the dying Jean, reports CNN.When you listen critically to what she is saying, you are going to hear that she is as concerned or more concerned about how this is going to affect her than this poor guy on the floor next to her, prosecutor Jason Hermus told jurors.While she was on the phone with a  operator, she also sent texts to her partner on the force, with whom she was intimate, saying: I need you hurry and I f***ed up, Hermus said.Hermus also sought to show that Guyger violated police protocol by opening fire on her neighbour in the first place.Jean was on his couch in his shorts, watching TV and eating vanilla ice cream when Guyger walked through the front door, Hermus said.Under the circumstances, he said, protocol demanded that she take cover and call for backup instead of opening fire.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, he explains why...TO anyone under the age of around , the lost world of the s probably looks like a very strange place.Indeed, to millennials the Falklands War, Greenham Common women, Les Dawson’s Blankety Blank, Ghostbusters and Michael J Fox on a hoverboard in Back To The Future  — the era must seem like ancient history.But for those of us who are a bit older, these were our formative — and gloriously escapist — years. From the stirring old-fashioned patriotism of Chariots Of Fire to the tear-jerking alien melodrama of ET — though for my six-year-old self, nothing matched the jaw-dropping moment in The Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker: “I am your father.”Perhaps only now, as the childhood memories begin to fade, can we see what the s did for us, from the shops on the high street to the contents of the typical family fridge.The first years of the decade, in particular, were a tipping point. The old industrial Britain, where men worked at the local factory, spent their evenings down the pub while women spent their days cooking, cleaning and looking after the kids, collapsed in ruins.Meanwhile a conservative, inward-looking, old-fashioned society was rushing towards a new world of fast food, exotic holidays, outrageous clothes and gleaming new computers.In the public imagination, the woman responsible for all this was Margaret Thatcher. And there’s no doubt that she changed the record after years of stagnation. Instead of flinching from change, as her male predecessors had done in the s and s, she threw open the doors, for both good and ill.But did the Iron Lady really change Britain’ single-handedly  I don’t think so. Look around your home, your workplace or high street, and you realise many of the biggest changes had nothing to do with her at all.Indeed, as Britain’s first female Prime Minister she was simply part of a trend. By the early s, six out of ten British women were going out to work — a higher proportion than in almost every other European country — with businesswomen such as the Body Shop’s Anita Roddick capturing the national imagination.But what would these new working women wear  Some dared to go to work in trousers, though not Mrs Thatcher, who told the papers that her Cabinet colleagues wouldn’t like it.When nine women teachers turned up to their Reading comprehensive in trousers, the headmaster locked them in a classroom so their young pupils’ minds would remain unsullied. And in , a memorial counsellor at Golders Green crematorium in North London was even sacked for wearing a “lady’s business trouser suit”, on the grounds it would offend grieving families.But with so many women working — in trousers or not — who would do the cooking when they got home  The answer, it turned out, was the microwave. By the mid-s there were more microwaves in Britain than in the rest of Europe combined.Thanks partly to TV cooks including Delia Smith and Keith Floyd, the British kitchen was going through a revolution. Out went the steamed puddings and spotted dicks of old. In came pizzas, curries and the ground-breaking Marks  Spencer Chicken Kiev, which cost £. for a pack of two, the equivalent of about £ today.The other big culinary winner of the decade was McDonald’s, which opened hundreds of British outlets during the decade. Like many s kids, I remember my first visit — for my friend Robert Greenwood’s birthday party in about  — as though it was yesterday.We all had cheeseburgers, a grinning Ronald McDonald handed out balloons and afterwards we were given a guided tour of the kitchen. I found the whole thing almost intolerably exciting.McDonald’s isn’t the only s relic still standing on high streets across the country. Next and Waterstones opened in  and Pret a Manger in , all three aimed at young, upwardly mobile professionals, or yuppies.Yet even at this early stage you could see the first shadows of the high street’s decline. In  the most modern shopping centre ever seen in Britain opened in Milton Keynes, Bucks, a vision in steel and glass.And three years later Sainsbury’s opened a pioneering, colossal new supermarket in Nine Elms, South London, with “ ieties of fresh fish”, “ dferent types of bread” and even “fresh orange juice . . . squeezed and bottled under customers’ eyes”.The chain’s plan was to become “the country’s biggest wine merchant, biggest butcher, biggest greengrocer”, all under one roof. Andsmall, family-run shops went to the wall, that was just too bad.What people were buying, too, was changing. Records, for example, gave way to cassettes, then cassettes to CDs.In music, disco and punk were old hat. Thanks partly to the rise of the synthesizer — and also to a new vogue for dressing up and showing off — the baton had passed to the New Romantic generation, spearheaded by groups such as Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and The Human League.Not since the Sixties had British pop seemed so imaginative, so alive. Indeed, even today the great singles of the era, such as Enola Gay, Don’t You Want Me, Just Can’t Get Enough and Vienna, still have a thrilling sense of technological optimism, captured by their ground-breaking videos.Older music critics hated the New Romantics. But most youngsters loved their new spirit of fun-loving ambition.“I don’t feel guilty because I’ve made enough money to own my own home,” remarked Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp. “It’s only the middle classes who feel that kind of guilt.” And Duran Duran’s Simon Le Bon made no secret of his materialistic aspirations. “We want to be substantially wealthy,” he said. “I mean ridiculously wealthy, rolling in it.”There spoke the spirit of the s. But the most dramatic musical innovation, launched in Britain in  , was the Sony Walkman, costing up to £ .Some people were horried by the idea of a personal music player — yet Sony went on to sell millions.  But the innovation that really changed things and for which the s will always be remembered was the computer.At the start of the decade most kids’ idea of fun was completing their Rubik’s Cubes. However, when the Cambridge entrepreneur Clive Sinclair unveiled the ZX in January  — at £. , the world’s first cheap home computer — he unleashed a revolution.By  Mrs Thatcher had committed to putting computers into every school, while the BBC launched its own national computer project, focusing on the new BBC Micro.Britain led the world in computer ownership by the mid-s, and youngsters were mad on games such as Elite, Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy.  At the time, some people recognised that computers would bring a gigantic social and economic transformation.Sinclair predicted the rise of driverless cars and “wireless devices that would allow us to telephone and be telephoned wherever we choose” — then blew his credibility with the C electric car in .Given that the early s saw the worst recession in our post-war history, with unemployment at almost four million, how did people find the money for all this  They borrowed it. Since people felt entitled to the good le, their new microwaves, video recorders and ZX Spectrum computers iniably went on Access or Barclaycard.At the height of the recession in , personal borrowing went up by a fth. Over the decade, it went up seven times. Today, when we’re some of the worst savers and most enthusiastic borrowers in the Western world, I can’t help thinking this is one s habit we really ought to break.The Spectrum may have disappeared into the dustbin of history, but as millions of us know to our cost, those credit card bills never stop coming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

been such a sticking point The Irish backstop is essentially a safety net that would prevent the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.Under the agreement negotiated by Theresa May, the UK would enter a transition period after officially leaving the EU during which it would remain a member of the bodys economic zones, namely the single market and the customs union.This would give the government time to agree the details of our new trading relationship with the European Union and businesses time to adjust with minimal disruption.The backstop would only come into effective were the transition period to end before all the details of the new relationship had been worked out.In the event the backstop came into force, Northern Ireland would remain a member of the single market until a trade agreement had been reached to keep the border effectively invisible.That would mean goods crossing the Irish border would not be subject to checks for customs or product standards.The whole of the UK would also remain in a common customs territory with the EU, meaning there would be no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes applied to UK-EU trade.The arrangement would keep the Northern Irish border open and minimise economic damage, but would also mean the UK would temporarily have to go on following the EUs rules and regulations without having a say in deciding them.The near-invisibility of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland was a major achievement of the peace process that brought the Troubles to an end.Communities on both sides of the border worry that theof border checks could revive social, cultural, and religious ides that have been fading in recent decades.During the Brexit negotiations, the European Union listened to the Irish governments about what theof a hard border would mean, and has insisted that any withdrawal agreement should include a backstop.The backstop became a major sticking point when Theresa May was trying to get parliament to back the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated.Many Conservatives MPs refused to vote for Theresa Mays deal because, were the backstop ever to come into force, it would have left the UK without a vote in deciding the EUs rules and regulations but still temporarily subject to them.The DUP, a Northern Irish unionist party that currently has  MPs in the House of Commons, refused to accept the backstop because it couldve left Northern Ireland in a dferent customs arrangement to the rest of the UK.It was also feared that the backstop could remain in place indefinitely, which could make it dficult for the UK to strike its own trade deals with other countries outside the EU.Boris Johnson twice voted against Theresa Mays deal in parliament, in part because he objected to the backstop, but decided to back it the third time May put it before the Commons.He repeated his criticism of the backstop while running for the Conservative leadership, and since becoming prime minister has said he would not agree a deal that included a backstop.He has said the backstop could be replaced by alternative arrangements to avoid the need for physical checks on the Irish border, though hasnt specied what those arrangements would be.Boris Johnson has opposed the backstop saying it is antidemocratic and could trap the UK in the EUs customs territory.Under the Prime Ministers plans checks would take place away from the actual border.He has suggested that physical checks would only be required on a small proportion of trade and most checks would take place on the premises of the trader.This would be similar to the arrangement Norway and Sweden have and allow inspectors from each others jurisdictions to carry out checks anywhere on all of Ireland.Mr Johnsons plans have some similarities to the backstop idea.Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations on areas such as agriculture, food safety and industrial goods, while the UK would not be obliged to.But with Mr Johnsons idea Northern Irelands Executive and Assembly would have to approve following the single market arrangement.Then Stormont would have to decide whether or not it wanted to continue following the rules or side with the UK every four years.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the latest Brexit proposals from Mr Johnson do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop.A spokesman for the Irish government said a conversation between the two leaders  was constructive and useful but added there was more work to be done.Mr Varadkar indicated that he would study the proposals in further detail, and would consult with the EU in the coming days.Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said the new proposals must be rejected, adding the plan would effectively give the DUP a veto.A spokesperson for Fianna Fail said the plans were not realistic and fall very far short of what is required.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said it was hard to see how the Ireland-specic Brexit proposals could workthe UK departs from EU standards and rights.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t. They settled instead on Japan With Sue Perkins, who went “in search of the country’s soul” by dressing up as a few cultural stereotypes and probably sending children to bed with nightmares in her geisha girl outfit.If WE did that, of course, “cultural appropriation” would be the least of the accusations made against us. But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture. Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations. They’ve lost the fundamentals.”And then think: “Yeah, what this country really needs is a naked dating show where contestants are judged on the state of their genitals, hosted by Sue Perkins’ missus.”That’ll drag ’em into the st Century.The consistently brilliant Good Morning Britain finding the only Piers Morgan impersonator in Japan who wasn’t wearing a wrestling nappy.Richard Madeley’s cameo in The Circle.Celebrity MasterChef contestant Joey Essex inventing the “stirotto” , which looked about as appetising as a pandopsy .And Strictly’s Mike Bushell attempting the American smooth, with Katya Jones, to that all-time Glen Campbell classic Like A Blind Stoned Cowboy.AMERICAN trailer-trash comedian Vicki Barbolak accidentally locked herself in a pink caravan at the start of her routine on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions. Then someone from production let her out and the problems really started.Two minutes into her act, Vicki came to a grinding halt and stuttered: “I . . . I . . . I changed everything I was going to do.” And decided to shove any good material down the caravan’s chemical toilet A horribly awkward moment for everyone, though not the first sign the booking process had seriously maled with this episode.That was the previous act – Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh, from Kazakhstan, whose “ceremony of sound” went where your iPhone alarm fears to tread, making the sort of random animal noises usually accompanied by the caption “footage courtesy of PETA”.British politeness rescued him from the silence that should have followed – along with David Walliams, who said: “People are not going to forget the name . . . sorry, I’ve forgotten your name.”What I definitely will remember about Saturday’s episode, though, is the timely question Simon Cowell posed to the act that followed Gennady and Vicki, Twist  Pulse: “The people who didn’t want to compete again.

For the Tories, it is a clear goal of policy.In his ambitious speech to the conference, the Chancellor Sajid Javid – who is the son of a bus driver – declared that the Living Wage would rise over the next five years from the present rate of £.-an-hour to £.-an-hour - and the age limit lowered from  to .Altogether, it is estimated that at least four million people will benefit from these far-reaching changes.The Chancellor’s scheme exposes all the left-wing nonsense about Tory toffs.This is not the action of a Government that is driven by concern only for the wealthy or is indferent to the struggles of those on limited earnings.A modern, thriving economy cannot be built on the back of exploitation and poverty pay.Anyone who goes out to work is entitled to a level of pay that can sustain a reasonable standard of living.Those who object to Sajid Javid’s proposal should be askedthey would be willing to work for less than £.-an-hour.In fact, it is depressing that so many people who do invaluable jobs in the community, like care home workers, hospitality staff and retailers are currently paid less than this.Looking after the elderly or disabled should be well-rewarded positions, not jobs hovering at the level of the minimum wage.Indeed, ever since they came to power in , the Conservatives have prioritised the quest to improve living standards and reward those who hold down jobs.That is why the Government has dramatically cut income tax for the low paid by raising the personal allowance from £,-a-year in  to £, this year.As a result, more than four million people who earn beneath this threshold no longer have to pay income tax at all.Meanwhile, contrary to all the rancid hysteria about alleged Tory bias to the rich, the top one per cent of earners now pay  per cent of all income tax.The Conservatives’ claim to be the party of the workers is further reinforced by their jobs miracle, which far exceeds anything achieved where in Europe.When the Tories took office in , there were widespread predictions that they would preside over soaring dole queues.Just the opposite happened. In the last nine years, no fewer than .million new jobs have been created, most of them full-time.Today, unemployment stands at just . per cent, the lowest level since . Over  per cent of the population is now in work, a historic record, with more women in the workplace than ever before and wages are now growing at their fastest rate in a decade.Inflation is low, while credit and mortgages have never been cheaper, which – along with tax cuts – boosts household budgets.Similarly, a consumer study out this week showed that expenditure on dining out is at its highest level for three years.Tory economic success, in the face of Labour’s hysterical gloom-mongering, points to a fundamental dference between the parties.The Conservatives believe in providing incentives towards diligence and enterprise.In contrast, Labour is ideologically obsessed with levelling down, trying to achieve a dogmatic form of equality through higher taxes, massive redistribution of wealth and lavish social security benefits.As history has continually taught us, it is a disastrous recipe for economic sclerosis and welfare dependency.Raising pay rather than benefits is the best way to bolster living standards.A generous welfare system is a heavy drag on the economy, not only because it imposes a huge burden on the taxpayer but also because it discourages work.On the other hand, a reasonable minimum wage raises productivity in the workplace, puts more money in the pockets of employees and expands the economy.The main objection to a higher minimum comes from employers, who argue that, because of rising costs, staff will be priced out of jobs - but there is little evidence to support such warnings.The same anxieties were voiced when Labour under Tony Blair first campaigned in  for the introduction of a minimum wage.At the time, the Tories said that policy would destroy jobs, particularly among young people. But such dire forecasts never materialised.Thankfully, the Conservatives have learnt that such messages of economic doom are hollow.It will turn our economy into a pioneer, with one of the highest statutory minimums in the world.Inevitably Labour has been carping this week, with the Shadow Chancellor bleating about the Tories’ pathetic attempt at catch-up.But such language just demonstrates Labour’s fear - as their mantle of the party of the workers is steadily pulled from their grasp."},{"url":null,"title":"commons speaker john bercow croaks","story":"NewsCommons Speaker John Bercow croaks order order after losing his voiceThe chairman has become famous across the world for his booming voice, but sounded rather raspy this morningShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video john-bercows-voice-goes-croaky-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics commons-speaker-john-bercow-croaks-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

She added: One of the things Iaposve been surprised with is how much support there has been for me, despite these allegations, because women see through these attacks and they know the narrative.   In an interview with LBC radio this week, the Prime Minister suggested stories about him and Ms Arcuri had come to light because of his Governmentaposs stance on Brexit .There are quite a lot of well-meaning and highly intelligent people who basically think that that would be something they donapost want to see, and I think that there is a concerted effort now to frustrate Brexit, he said.

It has been trialled at five John Lewis and four Waitrose stores. According to documents seen by the Mirror, the test is “designed to find outvideo replays can improve customer service”.  It adds only “selected managers” and those staff – known as Partners – who are filmed will see the footage. But some workers are furious. Writing in the firm’s Gazette magazine, one said, “many Partners are threatening legal action”. Adding: “Filming is a gross ­invasion of privacy.”  Another said it, “could be perceived as spying  Big Brother ”. One worker told the Mirror: “It has really upset a lot of people.” John Lewis admitted the trial uses “a filmed form of mystery shopping”.

Emily Gosling, , had been working for her familyaposs rum business in Ontario, Canada since  - before relocating to London five years later. However before the move and during a business trip to Vancouver in May , she met wine director Dave Bulters, also . Despite the pair hitting it off instantly, Emily went on to relocate the next year - ing once more for a business trip to Canada where she went on her fist date with Dave Although living thousands of miles apart, they opted to try long distance - speaking about how theyaposd one day decorate a flat together and what trips they would take when they were reunited. However, earlier this year Emily began experiencing night sweats, bloating, kidney pain and fatigue before she was eventually given the devastating news in March that she had germ cell oian cancer. Within a week of her diagnosis, Dave flew to London to be with Emily. Emily began chemotherapy immediately, followed by surgery to remove the seven-inch tumour.    The cancer diagnosis derailed the coupleaposs plans to live together, but Dave made the decision to quit his job in Vancouver to move to London permanently so he could support Emily. Emily believes that the months spent living together in London deeply strengthened their relationship because he remained by her side throughout her cancer battle. She said: The afternoon of my diagnosis, I met with a gynaecological oncology surgeon to discuss my options. It was shocking to hear all of this over a few hours. Then a few days later, I had a CT scan to determine whether the cancer had spread, fortunately it hadnapost. My GP said that based on the results of the CT, and the size and speed of tumour growth, I would undergo four to six months of chemotherapy to shrink the tumour before they operated. Dave arrived in London on March , and he came to an appointment with my oncologist where we were hoping to arrange a treatment plan for when I ed to Vancouver. What we were told instead was that the tumour was too aggressive, and Iaposd be starting chemotherapy that evening! After being told the shocking news of how aggressive her cancer was, Emily said Dave immediately made the decision to quit his job to be at her side.    She added: Dave and I walked to a nearby park. It was there that he told me that he was going to quit his job and move to London. I was so relieved, but I was also so angry because cancer hadnapost only taken over my le, it had taken over his too. Emily began chemotherapy at the end of March before having surgery on May  to remove the tumour, which was seven inches long and over three inches wide. Surgeons also removed her right oy, right fallopian tube, appendix and lymph nodes, leaving her with  staples in her sternum. In June, Emilyaposs oncologist permitted her toto Vancouver to complete her treatment as her recovery from surgery was going well. Emily said she was proud of what their relationship has endured, adding: The one positive thing about the cancer diagnosis was that we got to live together sooner than weaposd planned, even though the situation wasnapost quite what we had planned. Thereaposs no doubt that the months in London strengthened our relationship.

Courtney Smith, , gave birth at  weeks after going to the toilet and feeling little Charlieaposs head. Charlie was born within an hour - with his eyes still fused together and his lungs only half developed. Arriving on February  - three months before his due date - he weighed a tiny lb oz and doctors gave him just a  per cent chance of survival. Now he’s home in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and doing well at seven-and-a-half months old –  with parents Courtney and Jack McCluskey, , describing him as “a miracle”. As part a new BBC Scotland documentary, Tiny Lives, Courtney, who works in customer relations, remembers when she suddenly realised something wasn’t right at  weeks pregnant. She told the Daily Record: “I was in the house and started feeling a pain and cramps. But it was so early on, I didn’t think it would have been labour. “I went to seeI needed the toilet and felt his head there. I started hysterically crying and ran to Jack and told him – and his dad took me straight up to hospital in the car.”    Courtney gave birth within an hour of arriving at the hospital. But a doctor warned her the baby had just a  per cent chance of survival. The mum said: “I remember holding him for  seconds. He was in bubble wrap because his skin was so raw and delicate. Then they took him away and got him hooked up to monitors. “The first two weeks were a blur to me and Jack. “I remember looking at Charlie and blaming myself, automatically thinking, ‘What is it that I’ve done to make it happen ’ But it’s just one of those things. “I felt so upset, I just kept thinking I couldn’t see this wee baby surviving. “He looked like a wee foetus and his eyelids were fused together. His fingers and toes were so tiny but perfect and his skin was quite red. “We were told his lungs were really underdeveloped. That was the main problem at the start. “His tiny brain wasn’t fully developed and was at risk of bleeding, and there was a chance he would suffer disabilities.” Courtney added: “When you think of a premature baby, you think of a month early – you never think you’d have a baby so early.    “I never thought I would. I always thought about how big he’d be. “Nothing prepares you for it.” It was a roller-coaster journey for Courtney and warehouse operator Jack. Charlie suffered health setbacks and had ious operations, including for a hernia and laser eye surgery. When he was just days old, Charlie suffered an infection and doctors feared he might only have hours to live. Courtney recalled: “They saidhe doesn’t turn around in the next  hours, there’s a serious chance of death.” While their son pulled through, the couple sadly saw some other babies who didn’t make it. Courtney admits she had doubts whether Charlie would survive – but she tried to have hope. Not having experienced a usual pregnancy meant watching her son develop outside the womb. She said: “I missed out on him kicking – but then I got to see his eyes open. “And I got to see him growing, although he should have been doing that in my belly.” The couple were finally told they could take their son home in June – a week after they got the keys to their first house. Charlie was brought home still on oxygen.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis terraced home in Wales may look fairly typical on the outside, but it throws up a few surprises once you step through the door. The owners of the house in Neath have applied a unique personal style inside. Now, Wales Online reports , normal walls and doors have been replaced by entrances framed with glass bricks. And throughout itaposs rooms there are several interesting visual touches that demand instant attention. This is probably most evident in the huge kitchen-diner at the rear of the property.  Instead of the expected small kitchen and rear dining room of a terraced house, there is a large extension that provides a very sociable and light space. In this room the art deco basics are pretty much covered. There are colour LEDs hidden away that provide accent colours typical of the s think Miami sea-front home or cool American diner.  The sunken ceiling provides the classic art deco lozenge shape as well as the space to hide the mint green accent lighting. There are subtle curves included in the interior design, mainly provided by the unusual semi-circular kitchen island which also has hidden pink LEDs for the continuation of the Miami feel.  There is symmetry provided by the black splash-back tiles, the triple set of French doors to the garden plus the inventive use of glass bricks again. Both ends of the room have a symmetrical set of glass blocks that not only provide extra light, they continue the art deco theme initially set in the hallway. The fireplace at one end of the kitchen is an amazing chrome log burner, reminiscent of the vintage, cigar-shaped art decor chrome caravans in shape and texture. The house has benefited from not only from losing some walls and widening some doorways, but also from a two-storey rear extension. The ground floor accommodation is vast compared to what any visitor might expect from the outside.  There is a separate sitting room and dining room that could both become bedrooms, turning the home from a surprising five bed into an incredible seven bed property. This would still leave the house with a separate lounge and the large kitchen-diner. The versatility of this unusual home continues upstairs, in fact up two flights of stairs as, although not obvious from the outside, this house also has a loft conversion which has a surprise. Instead of a standard dormer, there is a window that continues down the roof to the floor to provide easy access onto a terrace that is the roof of the extension. Genius. Of course the view from the roof terrace is unusual, this house is brilliant at being unique, and looks out onto Neath RFCaposs rugby pitch - so no need to buy a season ticket, although some scrums might be missed due to annoying hedges in the way.  Back to the first floor and the whole width of the rear of the property has been converted into a huge master suite. The master bedroom is so large it can easily accommodation a three-piece suite and has a walk-in wardrobe and dressing room bigger than most terrace homeaposs third bedroom. In fact, it probably used to be this terraceaposs aposbox roomapos. Again the homeaposs versatility is evident, as the master bedroom could be ided into two bedrooms to increase the sleeping accommodation,changing theof any of the living space downstairs is not appealing to a new owner. The main bathroom on the first floor does not disappoint on the aposwow factorapos either.

She was transferred to Jaycee Burn Centre in Chapel Hill where she was treated for first and second degree burns over her whole body.    Doctors had to remove large amounts of skin tissue and carry out a number of skin grafts. Rebecca said she now needs help carrying out the smallest of every day tasks like showering and going to the toilet after her nightmare ordeal. She said: Emotionally it’s very hard, I can’t do everything I was normally able to do and have needed a great amount of help with just normal everyday tasks.    Now I am dealing with having to wear compression garments and removing them numerous times a day to put ointment on the burns.

Dan Molloy purchased the garment, which was meant to say Iaposd rather be watching Friends to celebrate the showaposs th anniversary but after wearing it out, he realised the word aposwatchingapos was missing a letter. And now, just a few days later, yet another clothing blunder has come to light. This time the error is on a purple Disney vest top featuring sparkly writing and illustrations of three classic movie villains, including the Evil Queen, Ursula and Maleficent.     A woman named Joanne purchased the item but when she got it home, she discovered something wasnapost quite right. Joanne, who lives in Hull, posted a photo of the garment on Twitter , joking that Primark needed to sack whoever was in charge of their quality control. She wrote: Spot the mistake!!! Hey @Primark your quality control needs sacking. Will it be worth money in the future. Can you see whataposs wrong with the top     If you look closely at the inside of the item, the fabric is printed with a Harry Potter logo - instead of a Disney one. The top does have a Disney tag on the strap though. Clearly there was some sort of mess up when printing the design. After being tagged in the tweet, Primarkaposs customer service account responded to the post, saying: Hi Joanne, thanks for your feedback! We will pass it on to our Buying Department.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day.

Given the nature of MND and the timeframe in which someone can become immobile, it is important that le is made as easy as possible for them.People are only eligiblethey are a recipient of the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowanceor those who score eight or more on the moving around descriptor for the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment .Back in , Scotlandrsquos blue badge scheme was extended to include carers and relatives of people with conditions such as dementia, autism and Downrsquos Syndrome, but not for MND.Waiting times and application dficulties can all act as barriers to people with MND obtaining a Blue Badge under the current circumstances. Waiting times associated with the processing of Blue Badge applications ies and currently it takes on average around  weeks.

This will allow for a prescription type of approach, which will mean an MND care team can automatically grant a Blue Badge.This was a victory for common sense and it will make a dference to those living with MND. At the heart of it all was allowing people with MND to keep their independence and dignity. The cost of making this change is minimal and the right thing to do.The positivity and tenacity that Doddie Weir has displayed throughout the years, in exceptionally dficult circumstances, is a formidable example to us all.I want to thank him for his unwavering support, and thank MND Scotland, my fellow parliamentary colleagues and my constituents for helping us achieve the aim of the campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-week","story":"This weeks Pet of the Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is Tony.The charity told us: \"Tony ndash named after Fat Tony from The Simpsons ndash is seven years old and is a very friendly boy who is currently on a bit of a diet as he weighs kg.\"Tony is looking for a home with no other pets.\"If you would like to offer Tony his forever home, please email info@borderspetrescue.org for an application.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-families-wanted-star-new-weight-loss-tv-show","story":"IS your child looking to lose weight Well, the makers of hit TV shows The Real Marigold Hotel and Ibiza Weekender are on the lookout for Borders families to take part in a new weight-loss series.Production company Twofour is casting for people aged - who want to cut down.And they will be offered a free and local personal trainer, nutritionist and have their food shop covered for six weeks.The series will be broadcast on Star.A spokesperson said: \"In the series, obese teenagers call on help from mum and dad , to try to reduce their size, which is hitting their health and their happiness.\"With specically tailored nutrition and exercise plans to help them lose the pounds, the families undertake an emotional journey of transformation and discovery, getting to the bottom of their weight gain.\"Working together as a family the teens hope to change their lestyle and get on the right track for a healthier and happier future.\"To take part, email newyou@twofour or contact producers on WhatsApp on ."},{"url":null,"title":"ineos-consults-potential-closure-site","story":"Chemicals giant Ineos has launched a consultation on the potential closure of a manufacturing plant which employs more than  workers.The company said not all the jobs will be lostit decides to close the Seal Sands Acrylonitrile plant on Teesside because of other activities at the site, which Ineos has owned for over a decade.A statement said that despite investing more than pound million to counter decades of ldquosignicant underinvestment, the company believes nothing more can be done to ensure operations are safe and economically viable.It would require another pound million just to meet Ineos standards and environmental regulations, said a statement.ldquoThe acrylonitrile process needs careful management and involves handling signicant quantities of hazardous material.ldquoThe company feels that it would not be possible to guarantee the long-term safety of our employees or our neighbours through continued operation of the plant and have thus reluctantly concluded that we should consider the option to close.Paul Overment of Ineos said: ldquoAfter considering many options, we feel that we must now consult with employees on the potential closure of the plant.ldquoWe do so with a heavy heart but there is no escaping the fact that decades of underinvestment on the site have led us to this point.ldquoManufacturing assets need constant renewalthey are to survive.The last  years have proven that it is almost impossible to play catch-up and the lesson for us and other UK manufacturers is that constant reinvestment is vital for long-term prosperity.GMB union official Tom Allison said:ldquoThis news is a body blow to Teesside with thousands of jobs at threat in the local supply chain.ldquoWe have members working on contracts at Seal Sands who are wracked with worry today about what the future holds.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot forget Ineos is owned by the richest man in the UK ndash this is a multinational business that made over pound billion last year.ldquoSir Jim Ratclfe has cash for a cycling team but apparently not to invest inmakingthis plant safe andfor the future.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

Sheep can be used in so many ways to benefit the environment and naivety from mainstream media risks increasing our environmental footprint.’Livestock is also widely criticised for its methane emissions which NSA say is, again, misleading.Mr Stocker added: ‘Methane shouldn’t be ignored it is an emitted gas that has an impact on global warming.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10496940.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10459949.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-scotlands-best-seafood-experiences","story":"The Seafood Ristorante, St AndrewsLocated in an iconic lsquoglass boxrsquo, the Seafood Ristorante relaunched in March  and isnow one of Scotlandrsquos premium dining venues.

He denies it, of course. But for advocates of the personal is political, his casual conduct is of immense signicance.Similarly, language and the PMs use of military metaphors betray personal traits that are politically signicant. His resort to words like ldquohumbug and ldquoSurrender Act are supposedly windows into the corrupt soul of a misogynistic micro-fascist. I hereby claim , by the way, on the term ldquomicro-fascist, which is an extension of the idea of ldquomicro-aggressions, so popular on university campuses among people who believe tiny things matter a lot.But do they  The media is obsessed with language right now, and personal conduct, possibly because many of its practitioners grew up with the personal is political phrase ringing in their ears. Twitter cant get enough of this stuff, though its no slouch itself when it comes to aggressive language. ldquoRacist, Liar. Misogynist. Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns. Doesnt mean they want to kill you with cannons.Indeed,military metaphors are to be regarded as incitements to violence, then Sir John Curtice had better watch out when he next talks of the general election ldquocampaign being a ldquobattleground with ldquotarget seats, an ldquoair war and a ldquodecapitation strategy. Boris Johnson just makes jokes about all this synthetic outrage. Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious. Sajid Javid says he is adopting their policy of a living wage set at % median earnings, to eliminate poverty pay in a decade.Now, they may not mean it. But it seems to me something pretty fundamental is going on undergrowth of British politicsthe Conservatives are even talking this way. The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-scotland-deserves-better-seemingly-endless-westminster-mess","story":"Writing in The Evening Times, Nicola Sturgeon wrote I feel like Irsquove been saying that a lot over the last three years, as the Brexit mess has lurched from crisis to crisis as the last Prime Minister was forced to resign and as the current Prime Minister loses control of the House of Commons.But in the last few days we seem to have entered completely unchartered territory.First there was the Supreme Courtrsquos ruling that Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully when he shut down Westminster for five weeks.Of course, it had been patently obvious to everyone that his claims that he needed to shut down Parliament in order to work on his legislative programme were complete rubbish ndash the only thing he wanted to shut down was any attempt by MPs to scrutinise his Brexit plans.:Boris Johnson attacked over plan to sideline Nicola SturgeonIt is truly historic and unprecedented in our modern democracy that a Prime Minister has been held to have broken the law in order to ndash in the words of the Supreme Court - ldquofrustrate or prevent the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional s.The UK Government wasnrsquot defeated in court on a technicality. It was a unanimous decision by all  judges.We should pay tribute to the campaigners in England and those in Scotland, led by the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry MP, who brought these court actions.But Boris Johnsonrsquos week of disgrace didnrsquot end there.Dragged back to Parliament to explain himself, rather than apologise or show any contrition, he instead blamed everybody  - using some of the worst language I have ever heard spoken by any politician in the House of Commons.And when one MP pleaded with him to tone down his inflammatory language, reminding him of the appalling murder of MP Jo Cox just before the Brexit referendum, he described her comments as ldquohumbug.Politicians, especially in leadership roles, must strive to act respectfully in everything we do - whether that is on a national level in parliament and the media, online, or locally in our constituencies.And when that agenda of respect slips and behaviour is not of the standard expected of us we should not hesitate for one moment to condemn it.After his deplorable behaviour last week it has never been clearer that ndash in both his deeds and his words ndash Boris Johnson is not fit to be Prime Minister.He needs to be removed from power as soon as possible.:Brexit: Scottish Conservatives brought into line with UKAfter an Act of Parliament passed earlier this month, the Prime Minister is legally required to write to the EU seeking an extension to the Brexit deadline so we donrsquot crash out without a deal at the end of this month ndash with all the disastrous consequences that would entail.But Boris Johnson appears hell-bent on subverting the law ndash andhe will not send the letter, we need a Prime Minister who will.Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures ndash frankly, we are running out of time.Thatrsquos at the heart of the plan the SNP have been putting forward over the last few days.Our proposal relies on MPs from across the political spectrum working together for the good of all the nations of the UK.This technocratic government would only be in place for a few days ndash long enough simply to send the formal request to extend the Brexit deadline.It would then dissolve itself and make way for a general election, giving the people of the UK the opportunity to elect new MPs and decide how they want to proceed.However, there are plenty other potential candidates for caretaker Prime Minister, who might command the support of a majority of MPs for this short-lived government ndash so it absolutely does not need to be the Labour leader.But to repeat, we are running out of time ndash and any option that prevents a no-deal Brexit needs to be consideredMPs can get behind it.Once the threat of crashing out of the EU has been averted, I would absolutely relish a general election ndash the chance to put our case to the people.It would allow us to make the case once again to protect Scotlandrsquos place in Europe, and to give the people of Scotland the right to choose independence.Taking a step back from the seemingly endless Westminster mess, Scotland deserves better than this. We didnrsquot vote for any of it, and Brexit or not, we should not be subject to the whim of chaotic and dangerous Tory governments.No wonder more and more people are seeing independence as the best option for Scotlandrsquos future."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-apprentice-bake-off-says-middle-classes","story":"Thatrsquos what The Apprentice and Bake-Off are, theyrsquore just reality shows ndash but theyrsquore disguised as something . One is dressed up in the clothes of a business executive, the other wears chefrsquos whites. Money and cooking ndash the twin gods of the bourgeoisie. But the DNA of both shows is no dferent to Big Brother or Love Island: real people are on screen for our entertainment. Thatrsquos it.Neither The Apprentice nor Bake-Off do anything very interesting or new. The Apprentice gives us a bunch of grasping idiots whorsquod sell their granny for an internship with an arms company ndash along the way theyrsquoll shamelessly mouth moronic, narcissistic, corporate slogans, like an accountant on crystal meth, and one will eventually win after happily allowing sadistic Sugar to trample over the shrivelled remains of their desperate soul.The Bake-Off.

If so, then Britain is the most boring, greedy, complacent, repetitive, mimsy little gingham and pinstripe corner of the world imaginable. You learn zilch about le and the people living ityou watch these shows.But this isnrsquot a diatribe against reality TV. I have come to praise the genre, not bury it. Irsquove long championed reality TV. I just donrsquot rate The Apprentice or Bake-Off as great representatives of the genre. The best reality TV gives viewers a glimpse of whatrsquos shting about in the tectonic plates of our world, how humans feel right here and right now, how society is changing, how peoplersquos lives and attitudes are being shaped.Reality TV is the very heart of popular, mainstream entertainment. I donrsquot think you can fully get to grips with the world unless you embrace reality TV and use it to navigate not just pop culture, but wider culture. If you think Irsquom mad, let me call TS Eliot in defence. Eliot, probably the th centuryrsquos greatest poet, was a huge admirer of the Music Hall ndash which was seen, a century ago, as the home of trash entertainment. Culturally, Music Hall was the Edwardian equivalent of reality TV. Eliot, though, believed Music Hall ndash with its iety acts, smut and sentimentality ndash was the truest representation of the society within which he lived. He felt that the Music Hall singer and comedian Marie Lloyd ldquorepresented and expressed something signicant about the spirit of the nation. Roll forward  years and Eliot could have been speaking about Big Brotherrsquos Jade Goody.George Orwell was also a fan of Music Hall. Many like him saw it as having a ldquoredeeming socialas it held a mirror directly up to ordinary le.Big Brother had more social signicance in a single episode than every series of The Apprentice and the Bake-Off put together. From the get-go it showed society changing when it came to sexuality and gender. It revealed chasms of racism in Britain, which were not being discussed. It showed up our culturersquos cruelty, pettiness, narcissism, stupidity and greed. Yes, of course, it was manipulative, gaudy, and loud ndash but so was the Music Hall.

Watch The Circle on Channel . Itrsquos as noisy and day-glo as Big Brother, but itrsquos also the most compelling dissection of the effects of social media on human beings that Irsquove ever seen.The show sees a group of strangers placed in isolation and only able to communicate via social media. On social media, they can be whoever they want to be. The last series was won by a man pretending to be a woman. Contestants are allowed to post fake pictures of themselves, or lie and manipulate. This series sees one man pretending to be a single mother, and a middle aged woman posing as a laddish bricklayer.As in the online world, people immediately place all emphasis on appearance ndash the selfie rules ndash but no-one knows whatrsquos fake, whatrsquos true. Contestants are addicted to clicks and likes. They lose touch with the real world and real human beings. They become needy, nervous, depressed, obsessed. They fall foul of group-think. They fear rejection ndash they crave the love of the online world they inhabit.On The Circle the mere act of posting a good or bad picture can change how everyone thinks of you. Itrsquos about curating your le so others see only your best side, not the real you. People share personal information in a way theyrsquod never do in real le. Acts of kindness are phoney and virtue-signalled. Everything comes with a hashtag and an emoji. Everything is manipulated. And when reality finally breaks in and the contestants meet each other in real le theyrsquore nothing like their digital selves. We see the real them ndash honest, shy, decent hellip normal.This is reality TV which explores the new reality in which we live: a phoney, empty, dumbed-down world thatrsquos a bit like an episode of The Apprentice or Bake-Off.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dem-mp-rather-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-pm","story":"Jamie Stone, the partyrsquos Scotland spokesman, seemed to say hewould choose no-deal ldquoevery time over handing the Labour leader the keys to Number .Labourrsquos shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird said Mr Stone had ldquolet the mask slip.:Mark Smith: Why on earth do so many people have a problem with Jo Swinson However, Mr Stone later insisted he had been misunderstood and was actually responding to an earlier question in which he had been asked to say which was worse.Ms Laird said: ldquoDespite the spin about being a new and invigorated party under Jo Swinson, they [the Lib Dems] are the same party that inflicted austerity on the country and they are now willing to inflict a no-deal Brexit on the country.\"Labour has been saying for months that the Lib Dems would rather a no-deal Brexit than for Jeremy Corbyn to become interim Prime Minister.\"A no-deal Brexit would be a catastrophe for working people across the UK.

but they will provide the crucial building blocks for enabling that visualisation.ldquoFirst, we will immediately see the internal structure of the scrolls in more definition than has ever been possible, and we need that level of detail to ferret out the highly compressed layers on which the text sits.The technology amplies the ink signal recognising exactly where the ink is using photographs of opened fragments.It can then be used on data from the still-rolled scrolls, identy the hidden ink, and make it more prominently visible to any reader, Prof Seales explained.The I beamline or JEEPbeamline, at Diamond is a high energy X-ray beamline for imaging, dfraction and scattering.Dr Thomas Connolley, the principle Beamline scientist, added: ldquoWe are very excited to work with the research team, playing our part in what we hope will be a major step forward in unlocking the secrets that the scrolls contain."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10495695.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotland-set-first-uk-ban-smacking","story":"The smacking ban is set to be voted on by the Scottish Parliament and would give children the same protection from violence as adults by removing the defence of justiable assault in Scots law.The Bill, introduced by Scottish Greens MSP John Finnie, faces its final vote on Wednesday, with the former police officer calling for cross-party support for the \"vital legal protections for Scotlands children\".The bill has its supportersRemoving a parents right to hit their child would bring Scotland up to international standards, Mr Finnie has argued, adding: \"Physical punishment has no place in st century\".:Church of Scotland -Jesus would not approve of parents smacking childrenAhead of the vote, Mr Finnie MSP said: \"This evening the Scottish Parliament has the opportunity to show courageous leadership by putting in place vital legal protections for Scotlands children.\"It is staggering that our smallest and most vulnerable citizens are the only people who do not currently have this protection, and now is the time to recty that.\"Physical punishment has no place in st century Scotland.\"The international evidence tells us that it can have serious adverse impacts on children, and that it is not effective.:Smacking ban lsquowill do nothing to help vulnerable childrenrsquo#\"It is time for parliament to put an end to it tonight.\"When the Bill passed the first stage towards becoming law, having been approved by  votes to , Mr Finnie compared the legislation to other law changes such as the smoking ban and drink-driving rules which aimed to inspire widespread social change.Soon to be a thing of the pastHowever, opponents of the Bill have raised fears that it could criminalise thousands of parents for disciplining their children.Jamie Gillies, from the campaign group Be Reasonable, said: \"Seeking to further the protection of children is highly commendable, but a smacking ban is not the way to do it.:Smacking ban a lsquopositive and necessary steprsquo, says MSP\"The risks this proposal carries to family le, social work and the police mean it could end up doing far more harm than good.\"The Government should invest in current services, which are already hard-pressed, and bolster their ability to identy and tackle abuse.\""},{"url":null,"title":"women-lose-lose-case-pension-age-changes","story":"Nearly four million women born in the s have been affected by the changes,

can be transformed into a sustainable fuel to power future energy needs.So environmental organisation Zero Waste Scotland is using this year’s Recycle Weekto raise awareness of the potential energy that can be captured by simply placing peelings, egg shells, tea bags and any uneaten produce in household food recycling caddies.The time travelling DeLorean used in the classic s movies was modied to run on food waste – and the technology now exists to use it today to power vehicles, heat our homes and grow more food.Estimates from Zero Waste Scotland reveal that , tonnes of global warming CO equivalent gas would be saved from entering the environmenteveryone in Scotland with access to a food caddy recycled their tea bags. Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie screwfix shop is approved","story":"Councillors have approved plans for the erection of a shop on the site of the former IK Motors yard on Inverurie#s Blackhall Industrial Estate.Aberdeenshire Council’s Garioch Area Committee heard on Tuesday that the site, which was formerly used for car sales by IK Motors, is currently unused with all sales now taking place at Highclere Business Park.The new building will be occupied by Screwfix and while the main market served by the company is trade sales, the premises would also be open to members of the public Monday to Friday from am to pm, Saturday from am to pm and Sunday from am to pm.Councillors heard that the proposal would create  jobs.The wider site currently accommodates a number of outlets including the likes of Morrisons, the Strathburn Hotel, Firework Scotland Ltd, Magpie Second Hand Furniture, William Wilson Plumbing Centre andthe Fly Cup Coffee Shop.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Westminster’s corrosive discussion style rewards smirk and smarm, sarcasm and grandiloquence. Ratings for the BBC Parliament channel have shot up. Many new viewers will find themselves nauseated by the baying.Bolshy tub-thumping does please a select audience. Those who rejoice in Brexit chaos and spread opportunistic lines of establishment shake-up, those who scream “traitors”, and those who require Gina Miller to have security protection.

The drawbacks of belonging in the Union are more readily demonstrable, with logic and reason increasingly thin on the ground. In this light, Sturgeon’s reputation as level-headed, intelligent, and engaged is more than ever a massive asset to persuading former No voters over the line.In , her predecessor Alex Salmond’s palpable desire to ‘win’ a point, and the relish with which he appeared to be playing the game, was satisfying for those who already agreed with him and deeply irritating for those who didn’t. Some of those developing in Salmond’s mould have more than a little hint of that egotistical hubris, and it is unlikely to do the movement favours in the long run.No-ingJoanna Cherry’s excellent contribution to legal challenges to prorogation of Parliament has both shown her strengths as a QC and boosted her UK-wide profile. There’s ato the Court of Session in Edinburgh tomorrow in an attempt to compel Johnson to seek an extension to article , should no deal be agreed before  October. It could be another remarkable moment. This kind of expertise is also in stark contrast to Johnson’s circus antics and the last few years of rationality and common sense in Westminster being wilfully eroded and derided.So it seems self-defeating, but not entirely surprising, that Cherry is billed as speaking at Saturday’s All Under One Banner rally straight after her legal triumph. The bill also includes Tommy Sheridan, notoriously convicted of perjury and who has been promoting the event on Sputnik TV. SNP women politicians and campaign group Women For Independence have spoken on several occasions about refusing to share a stage with Sheridan following the acrimonious row with a group of women in the now-split Scottish Socialist Party. We know dissuaded women voters are an important target group for the campaign.: Boris Johnson warns Brexit delay will trigger  chaos and indyref: Why it’s wrong for SNP to talk about sending me ‘homeward’ – Luke Graham MPNo matter where you stand on the logistics of no-ing, and certainly Cherry has the right to speak alongside whomever she chooses, the biggest names repeatedly appearing on these line-ups hark back to both unsavoury episodes in Scottish politics and yesterday’s has-beens, and anchors the argument with glaring lack of credibility. Responding to these events is a tricky balance for independence parties, who can’t really ignore the many decent people who have the right to demonstrate support for independence by marching and who are bolstered by having a comradely day out, but ultimately, they’ve already been won. The campaign needs to win over the more sceptical, who are likely alienated by such displays.Also speaking at the event is Cherry’s frequent cheerleader, Chris McEleny, who has similarly engaged with wedge issues like the Gender Recognition Act while remaining reticent on abortion rights, as I wrote about back in May. Transpeople and women deeply deserve consensus and a way forward rather than a fanning of ision, and everyone deserves politics demonstrating common sense right now. As clueless as it getsOne day after celebrating Cherry’s success at the Supreme Court, McEleny replied to the tweet: “Question to all Scottish independence supporters slavering over Lady Hale. Would you be willing to break ‘the rule of law’ to achieve independence ” with the answer “Gandhi, Mandela, Dr King, Rosa Parks, Bruce, Wallace... all broke the law of the time.” With the threat of Johnson aiming to undermine the crucial judicial win, this is as clueless as it gets.Angus MacNeil, the Tweedledum to McEleny’s Tweedledee, has joined him in campaigning to push ahead with independence through a Section  order. A loud, obnoxious, and not particularly bright contingent has been banging drums of discontent for some time, praising ex-leader Salmond and disparaging Sturgeon’s slow and steady leadership style. The outcome of these combined interests will undoubtedly win them some personal fans from the party fringes, and sow a few seeds of dissatisfaction with current leadership who rightly demonstrate resistance to recklessness at this crucial moment. But in its petulance, impatience, and willingness to court minority interests to dent the more widespread appeal that the leadership has, it is the exact opposite of what the Yes campaign now requires.The landscape has been fundamentally changed. The Yes campaign needs only gesture in the direction of the calamity that has ensued to show how promises by the No campaign have been turned on their head or shown to be hollow. The focus now must be, very specically, on the voters who opposed independence in  but who are horried at Brexit and rampant populism, and to present a sensible and credible alternative, argued strongly but calmly, looking secure and in control. This is exactly Sturgeon’s lane, and it’s exactly the opposite of taking a microphone after Sheridan has shouted into it.People are so tired of populists. They’re tired of those who sow ision, of reckless grandstanding, and of politics being spat out with fury rather than calmly negotiated. They’re tired of blunt stupidity. They’re tired of flags. Scottish voters who desire to remain in the EU are aghast at what has transpired and they don’t want more in the vein of self-serving, table-thumping bombast. Children expect immediate gratication, but slow and steady will win this race.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first minister s questions live nicola sturgeon faces msps","story":"Nicola Sturgeon willto Holyrood to take questions from MSPs.Refresh the page for latest updates as the First Minister is pressed on a range of issues.[]js  djs.id  idjs.src  \"embed.playbuzz \"fjsFor all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sought advice on sacking prime minister source claims","story":"The monarch reportedly asked aides for first time in her reign just how and when should could dismiss a PM.The Queen sought advice on the circumstances in which she could sack a prime minister ahead of Tuesday’s incendiary Supreme Court ruling, i has been told.A source claims that the monarch asked her aides for the first time for clarication on just when and how she could dismiss a prime minister who refuses to step aside.The alleged consultations reinforce suggestions that the monarch and her most senior aides had deep concerns about Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, even before the country’s most senior court was asked to declare the move unlawful.It was reported on Sunday that Mr Johnson phoned the Queen to personally apologise for the embarrassment caused by the crushing Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully when he advised the monarch to suspend Parliament for five weeks - advice which she was obliged to accept.: Johnson refuses to confirm he apologised to the Queen​ Constitutional crisisi has now been told that the Queen personally asked for advice on the constitutional circumstances in which she can effectively sack a prime minister.Under the rules of the British constitution the Queen can only \"advise, encourage and warn\" ministers. It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why fracking has sparked the most heated debates since the scottish independence referendum","story":"The debate over fracking in Scotland has produced some of the most heated clashes since the independence referendum.The Scottish Government looks poised to finally draw a line under this issue when energy minister Paul Wheelhouse sets out plans for a ban on Thursday.Scotland has been here before when the same minister unveiled an \"effective ban\" exactly two years at Holyrood, with evenNicola Sturgeon telling the Scottish Parliament that fracking was banned.But an embarrassing court case brought by petrochemical giant Ineos found the ban had no legal standing.: Fracking ban ‘accidentally’ revealed by bungling Scottish Government officialsThe Governments own lawyer James Mure even admitted that the effective ban was a “gloss” and the “language of a press statement”.In fairness no fracking has taken place in Scotland since that time, with ministers using their clout over the planning system to ensure this.The last two years have seen sundry consultations and studies undertaken by the Scottish Government into the technique which is formally known as hydraulic fracturing. it involves rocks up to a mile underground being “fractured” with high pressure water injection.Shale gas then escapes and is piped back up to the surface. An independent  of scientic experts tasked by the Scottish Government with looking into fracking has previously found the practice could be conducted safely in Scotland.Scotland’s Central Belt alone is sitting on trillions of cubic feet of the stuff. A British Geological Surveyreport a few years ago found this alone could provide enough gas to meet the country’s needs for the next half century.: Danielle Rowley: SNP aren’t serious about opposing frackingFirms like Ineos had been keen to undertake drilling exploration to establish its commercial viability. With Scotlands oil and gas industry now in dowturnn and a shadow of its former self, supporters say it has the potential to be transformational to the economy.But it is hugely controversial. In England, where fracking is allowed, energy giant Cuadrilla this week abandoned a site in Lancashire after earthquakees were recorded as a result of the practice.The firm insists it is looking at other wells which have been fractured to assess their potential. There is also the broader concerns about the impact of extracting more fossil fuels to burn at a time when the Scottish Government has warned of a \"climate emergency\" which needs to be tackled.As a new generation takes to the streets across the country demanding action on climate change, it would seem that fracking is no longer unpalatable.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

I’m delighted with it – I’d kick a ball all day longI could!I’m glad that it hasn’t been impacted and I was able to play in the league and be a part of the team for the Championship.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm. The yard went into administration in August following the collapse of its Norwegian parent company.InfraStrata said it will retain the  workers who are still employed.Trade union Unite says it expects people toto work as early as this week. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology. That’s where the economy of the future is and we should be preparing for it now.“I want to pay tribute to the immense strength and resilience of the shipyard workers and their trade union representatives who made this a pressing political priority.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lamh dhearg and portglenone get ready for part three","story":"BOTH Lámh Dhearg and Portglenone will be hoping it’s third time lucky in Ballymena this eveningas they meet once again to see who will advance into Sunday’s Antrim Senior Football Championship final.Thursday’s replay at Queen’s Arena was another night of high drama as Conall Delargy kicked an equaliser deep into stoppage time to force extra-time and Casement’s thought they had got it done as they led by one in the dying seconds of the additional period, only for Ben Rice to storm through and kick another equaliser with the last act of the game and force a free-kick contest.After five kicks each, the teams were level at - so it went to sudden death with the five kickers going again and all converted, prompting Antrim chairman Ciaran McCavana to step in and offer the teams the opportunity of another game to decide it in a more orthodox manner.His decision mostly drew praise from throughout the county and it was also applauded by Lámh Dhearg manager, Mairtín Lynch, who felt McCavana did the right thing.“I thought it was terribly brave of the county board a to advocate this and they should be given great praise for what they did,” he said.“Both teams need massive respect because they#ve brought tremendous goodwill to Antrim football. Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

When the Assembly comes to consider the issue of alignment, then it will be a matter for the Assembly,\" he said.\"What we have done is set up a process, what we have done is ensure that decision will not be imposed by Dublin, not be imposed by Brussels, not be imposed by anyone without the agreement of politicians in Northern Ireland.\"Onlyunionists in the Assembly agree to it - thats the process point. We would only agree to anythingits in the economic best interest of Northern Ireland and it didnt create any trade barriers, or borders, between the rest of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.\"Boris Johnsonss proposals would also see Northern Ireland leaving the EU customs union, meaning there would have to be checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the Republic.The plan insisted, however, checks would not take place \"at, or even near\" the border and only a \"very small proportion\" of good would have to undergo physical checks at either traders premises or other designated locations on the island of Ireland.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told ITVs Good Morning Britain: \"Well actually, today theres a border, theres a border in terms of currency and theres a border in terms of tax, but in terms of putting no infrastructure at the border, in terms of ensuring that we are consistent with the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, then it does do that, thats exactly what these proposals do.\"Explaining how goods will be checked, he said: \"The proposals, in terms of having a regulatory zone, clearly reduce signicantly the need for checks.\"In terms of then on customs, coming out of a customs union inevitably requires there to be some customs checks.\"And those will be done at premises, and weve set out in the paper all the detail as to how that would work.\"On the issue of Northern Ireland not having a ing executive, Mr Barclay told Good Morning Britain: \"I think that is one of the key priorities, and part of this is about giving democratic control back to the people in Northern Ireland.\"And one of the concerns with the backstop was that it would have involved laws applying over which people wouldnt have a vote, and it was at odds with the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in terms of having the consent of both sides of the community, both communities in Northern Ireland.\"He again reiterated that one of the \"key issues\" is to get the Northern Ireland Executive up and running.\"Whilst this issue is still live its actually an impediment to getting the Executive in place,\" he said.\"So lets get a deal, lets leave in a way that is consistent with the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, avoid the disruption that many in Northern Ireland want to see avoided in terms of no deal, because many of these checks will be required to protect the integrity of the single market in the event of no deal, and then lets get the Executive up and running because thats what people want to see.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit northern ireland parties round on dup after road to damascus shift from its red lines","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I hope that she, like me, as a local MP, will work with all local agencies to ensure that everyone who’s entitled to that support gets it.”Additional concerns were raised about the policy change potentially resulting in more fraudulent activity targeting elderly people.This is the latest version of a scam email we are seeing a lot of today.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference.

Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is.

He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon.

development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station.

After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17912970.magical-night-great-music/resources/images/10484346.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Agri-food goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would do so via a Border Inspection Post or Designated Point of Entry as required by EU law, building on the provisions that already exist to support the SEU. They would be subject to identity and documentary checks and physical examination by UK authorities as required by the relevant EU rules.says that:“Northern Ireland would also align with all relevant EU rules relating to the placing on the market of manufactured goods. This would reinforce the arrangements above by ensuring that regulatory checks can be implemented at the boundary of the zone, as appropriate and in line with relevant EU law, minimising the potential for non-compliance.The official UK government position articulated in this document therefore makes it clear that all goods coming into Northern Ireland will have to do so via border inspection posts.No regulatory border with the Republic, but one with Great Britain! Leaving Northern Ireland alone in the EU’s single market like this is totally unacceptable and it is staggering that any unionist would even countenance such proposals for a moment.\"  \"  Northern Ireland abortion law a breach of human rights commitments rules Belfast courtMan charged with string of offences after trying to sell stolen tools at Milton Keynes cash converter store Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Northern Ireland would remain subject to EU law, not British law, when it comes to the single market. Laws over which we would have no say a vassal colony of the EU. Does anyone seriously believe that nationalists will not use this as a pretext to argue that we would be better off with MEPs in a united Ireland We would remain under the European Court of Justice on all single market issues.While paragraph  commits the government to guaranteeing Northern Irish businesses and farmers continued unfettered access to the rest of the UK market it does not say that in reverse. In fact, it expressly says the opposite. Goods and services will be able to flow unhindered from Northern Ireland to Great Britain,but when they come from Great Britain to Northern Ireland they will be subject to checks — a key flaw in Mrs May’s proposals therefore remains.Under these proposals Great Britain can and will erge from EU single market rules, creating increasing severance with the rest of the UK.Evenone puts aside the very serious constitutional ramications of agreeing to these proposals, economically they make no sense.NISRA publish data annually as part of their Northern Ireland Broad Economy Sales and Exports Statistics.Its analysis of purchases and imports from trade partners split by goods and services for  showed that • The total purchases from Great Britain in goods was £, million while the purchases of services from Great Britain was £, million. • The total imports from the Republic of Ireland in goods was £, million while the purchases of services from the Republic was £ million. In fact, the total purchases in goods from Great Britaindwarfed the total purchases in goods from the Republic and the rest of the EU combined . So, for sake of easy access for £, million of goods from the Republic these proposalsfetter £, million goods from Great Britain — the very goods that stock our supermarket shelves and are part of the vital supply chain to our industry.Doubtless we will be told that these proposals are improvement on those put forward by Mrs May because it gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a say. But let’s consider that.Paragraphs  and  say that the Assembly and Executive must give their consent on an on going basis “before the end of the transition period, and every four years afterwards”. This is a recipe for instability, not stability.This plan creates a new crisis date —  — which you can see becoming the focus for Sinn Fein’s campaign for a unity referendum.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But our role as judges in this case is limited.ldquoThere is no basis for concluding that the policy choices reflected in this legislation were not open to government. We are satisfied that they were.ldquoIn any event they were approved by Parliament.

The struggling on behalf of those beleaguered women, whose stories saddened the judges but for whom this judgment provided no relief, will continue.Ms Willis Stewart concluded: ldquoWe will meet with our legal team to consider the detailed reasons contained in the judgment in order to see how to progress these pressing issues further.Several MPs expressed their support for women affected by the state pension age changes following the decision.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted that she was ldquodisappointed with the ruling, while Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: ldquoThe gross pensions injustice for #swomen remains ndash I will continue to support their fight.Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis described the decision as ldquoa terrible blow for the millions of women who will have been hoping for a very dferent outcome today..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Campaigners urge Parliament to intervene over state pension age changes article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
