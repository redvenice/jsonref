Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But thanks to safety measures put in place, a branch of David Abrahamovitch’s coffee chain is welcoming back happy customers and staffFor David Abrahamovitch, founder of cult coffee brand Grind, the decision to close his London-based food, coffee and cocktail bars was a painful one – and the decision to reopen one branch as a takeaway outlet on 20 May took even more careful planning.Abrahamovitch’s business journey started in 2011, when he inherited his father’s company. “I was 25 when I sadly lost my dad and inherited the family’s mobile phone business,” he says. “I had to decide what to do next – are we going to continue, are we going to close? I’d spent a lot of time in the shop as a teenager, helping out behind the counter, so it was very sentimental for me. I decided I wanted to keep the building and turn it into some kind of meeting place.”Converting the Old Street premises into a coffee shop, Abrahamovitch set about growing his business based on the cafes he’d visited on his travels. “I’d seen the independent cafe scene in other countries, and back then it just didn’t feel like it had been fully translated to the UK,” he says.“I wanted to recreate that Australian-style flat-white culture, with high-quality coffee beans, the best equipment, and amazing baristas who serve cups of coffee somewhere fun, lively and energetic. And I wanted to mix that with what the coffee chains do so well: good hygiene, mobile ordering and payment options and, most importantly, speedy service. A year later, we added cocktails when we realised our coffee made amazing espresso martinis!”Over the next nine years Abrahamovitch rolled his business out, spreading to 11 locations with 300 members of staff, serving sit-down breakfasts, lunch and dinner alongside coffee and cocktails. Grind also has an online business selling compostable coffee pods in refillable tins.When coronavirus reached the UK, Abrahamovitch’s business was sent into turmoil. “I’ve lived and bled this company for almost 10 years, and built it piece by piece, so finally getting to the point where we have tens of thousands of customers each week, then suddenly having to close was awful,” he says. “I remember the week of lockdown vividly. For a couple of weeks beforehand, we’d already seen sales start to fall away. We monitor sales to the hour, so when things start to drop off, you really notice it.“Then, when Boris Johnson told people they shouldn’t visit restaurants and bars, it was clear to us it was time to close. We shut all our stores, keeping just three open for takeaway to serve the local community for a few more days. When full lockdown was announced, we decided to close completely to protect our staff.”In the weeks since lockdown began, significantly more has been learned about the spread of Covid-19, and on 10 May the government announced certain businesses could reopen, with stringent safety rules in place. Guidance on how bosses can protect their workers, and how staff can safely travel into work, was drawn up. So now, companies such as Grind are taking tentative steps towards getting back to business, and on 20 May, its Greenwich outlet reopened its doors for grab-and-go coffees.Since plans to reopen were made, the safety of both staff and customers has been paramount. Grind works with a food hygiene company that has helped Abrahamovitch stay on top of the new government guidelines on safety and hygiene. “I think we’re all in a testing phase and figuring this out at the moment, but we’ve taken the steps we think are sensible without filling the place with yellow tape,” he says.“Only a couple of people are allowed inside the shop at any one time. Staff wear gloves, and at the tills there are big plastic screens separating them from customers – we haven’t made the wearing of masks mandatory, but they’re available if staff would like to use one.“We also have signs in the windows asking people to observe social distancing, stickers on the floor indicating what a two-metre gap looks like, and a hand sanitising station. It’s slightly odd having these things everywhere, but it seems to be working so far. I think people have got used to that kind of process in the last few weeks.”As well as coffee, the store is selling fresh bread, eggs and avocados, in lieu of breakfast. “We weren’t selling those things before, but we have great suppliers who make amazing bread and send us amazing eggs,” he says. “If we can help them and sell a few more products ourselves too, it makes sense. When you’ve suddenly got a daily bread delivery, it feels like you’re getting the wheels turning again.”Abrahamovitch took the inidual needs of his staff into careful consideration, making decisions based on the government’s advice, along with his own sense of duty to worried workers. On reopening Greenwich Grind, he took the simple step of asking which of his staff would be keen to return to work.“Everyone who wanted to be furloughed has been furloughed,” he says. “We haven’t laid anyone off as a result of this crisis, which helps me sleep better at night. Of those who volunteered to come back to Greenwich Grind, we selected those who live very close to the store, so there’s no need for them to get public transport into work. Lots of our staff walk or cycle in anyway, so if someone wants to come back, and lives close to a store we’re reopening, that’s a good fit.”Abrahamovitch hopes these measures will prove successful, and will lay the foundations for further, tentative reopenings. “We’re certainly expecting to learn a lot from this reopening,” he says. “At a lot of our sites, social distancing isn’t actually the biggest issue – for example, our London Bridge site relies on customers who work in the offices in the area, and the tourists who come to visit Borough Market at the weekend. Until they’re back, it’s going to be hard for us to reopen, but I hope to reopen one or two more branches in the next couple of weeks.”Abrahamovitch’s customers and staff are especially pleased by this step on the way to resuming business. “One of my staff texted me on the first day of reopening and said: ‘I’m so happy to be back and not just sitting in my living room. It’s been amazing.’ So that was pretty nice,” he says. “Our customers are thrilled, too – I was there the day before we opened, checking the safety measures for myself, and people were knocking on the door hoping to get inside early.“For me, as a customer, every time a place reopens I’m really happy. I think: ‘Great, I’ve got somewhere else to go, different people to meet, some different walls to look at.’ It’s definitely the same for our customers. They’re very pleased to have us back.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But can it survive a tidal wave of foreign investment?Hovering like a banana-coloured flying saucer above the dusty, congested streets of scooters and cyclo taxis, the central market of Phnom Penh is a remarkable thing. Its enormous concrete dome rises in sharply serrated steps, perforated with screens of chevron tiles, above four long streamlined arms that stretch out like the wings of a benevolent mothership, sheltering the chaotic labyrinth of market stalls below. Built in the 1930s, as a futuristic fusion of French art deco and Khmer temple motifs, it featured the second largest concrete dome in the world at the time (trumped only by the Pantheon in Rome), a fitting symbol of the Cambodian capital’s status as the “Pearl of Asia”.I didn’t have high hopes for Phnom Penh when I arrived there on a backpacking trip in 2003, after a few days exploring the jungle temple complex of Angkor Wat and the floating villages of Tonlé Sap. I had been warned to get out of the Cambodian capital as quickly as possible and head for the coast. Almost entirely emptied of its population by the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s, the city was now bouncing back as an unplanned jumble, with French colonial buildings left to rot as new development expanded outwards in an unbridled sprawl.Yet Phnom Penh had a magnetic charm in its frenzied muddle, with dense streets of Chinese shophouses jostling for position with crumbling French mansions and heroic 1960s experiments in the New Khmer architecture of post-independence Cambodia. After interminable weeks of lockdown, it is exactly the kind of frenetic urban melee I’m longing for, to be lost in the bustle of crowds and wander for hours with no purpose other than to discover what lies around the next corner.Exploring a new city is a luxury most of us won’t have for a while, but in the meantime you can indulge your wanderlust with an architectural guidebook from Berlin-based publishers Dom. Since 2005, the architect-run firm has been producing illuminating titles on some of the world’s lesser-trodden architectural hotspots, from Astana to Pyongyang, Wrocław to Yerevan – and even the moon. Phnom Penh is a timely addition, a place whose architectural wonders from all eras have been increasingly under threat from a tidal wave of foreign investment, with no standardised\u0026nbspbuilding code\u0026nbspnor binding zoning rules in place to guide the influx.The origin myth of Phnom Penh describes how a wealthy widow, named Grandmother Penh, found four bronze Buddha statues in a hollow tree in the river by her house, and erected a small shrine on an artificial hill (“phnom” in Khmer) to protect them. Wat Phnom still stands there, progressively enlarged and gilded over the centuries by generations of kings, its hill raised by tonnes of soil excavated from where the central market now stands.The temple’s white conical stupa rises above a cityscape that is mostly the result of French beaux-arts planning, its network of broad boulevards and public parks laid out from the 1870s onwards when Cambodia became a French protectorate. Under Parisian control until 1953, the city developed into a supremely elegant place, its tree-lined streets flanked by creamy stucco piles and ornate neo-Khmer fantasies such as the Royal Palace and the National Museum, along with art deco wonders including the central market.But the period that is enjoying renewed interest, overlooked until recently and still under threat, is the daring post-independence work of the 60s. It was an optimistic time of modernisation and bold infrastructure projects under Norodom Sihanouk, the eccentric king who became the first prime minster of the independent state. Proclaiming a new era of “royal Buddhist socialism” (which had very little to do with socialism and a lot to do with monarchic nationalism) Sihanouk embarked on an ambitious programme of public works, building schools, factories, sports facilities and cultural centres along with a deep sea port and expanded airport. Chief form-giver to much of this was Vann Molyvann, a young architect who had studied in Paris and brought a fresh new approach, combining international modernist principles with a deep appreciation of Khmer culture and an understanding of the local climate.“We could not simply repeat things as they were once done in Europe,” said Vann, in an interview later in life. “We had to think of new ideas, with a Cambodian perspective.” It was an uphill struggle. “When I first came back to Cambodia,” he recalled, “no one knew what an architect was.”He soon showed them. His first building was the expressive Chaktomuk conference hall, which still stands on the banks of the river like the leaf of a gigantic fan palm. Its zig-zag roof expands outwards in a broad arc, enclosing the fan-shaped hall and presenting the street with a curved frontage like an ornamental tiara. Next came the National Sports Complex (proudly known as the Olympic Stadium, despite Cambodia having never hosted the Olympic Games), a sublime essay in concrete construction, with four cantilevered waffle-slab roofs each supported by a single column – a feat managed with the help of Le Corbusier’s engineer, Vladimir Bodiansky. A structure as archaic as it is monumental, it has allusions to the temples of Angkor with its axial layout and quadripartite isions, as well as clever passive environmental techniques, using moats to encourage ventilation and cooling, way ahead of its time.Vann deployed similar principles at the Royal University campus, where his former teacher training college stands as a masterpiece of the New Khmer spirit. A roof of honeycomb tubes hangs above an open loggia where windows are set back behind deep concrete shading fins brick panels appear to float above a bridge flanked by naga (the ine half-serpent creatures of Hindu mythology), leading to elevated causeways that snake their way around the lush green campus above a series of cooling ponds.Tapering concrete columns ring a circular library, modelled on a typical Cambodian farmer’s straw hat, while a series of lecture halls are lined up along the side of a bridge pathway like chubby animals at a drinking trough. While the city’s new shopping malls are often chilled to arctic temperatures by energy-guzzling air conditioning, the rooms of the college are pleasantly cool without any mechanical systems, thanks to Vann’s climate-sensitive designs. “Cambodia is a society of half-earth, half-water,” the architect said. “Cities should not be built by landfill but by incorporating water into their design.”Sadly these are principles that seem to have been all but abandoned. In 2000, a Taiwanese investment company signed a contract to renovate the stadium in exchange for building on the land around it the company proceeded to fill up the moats with offices and shops, destroying the hydraulic cooling system in the process. The surrounding land has since been sold for development, leading to a rash of high-rise blocks that now fringe the grounds.As the guidebook’s authors lament, the last decade has seen unprecedented growth, with destructive consequences. Following recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, Phnom Penh has become a real-estate hotspot for Chinese and South Korean investors looking to buy property without the tedious regulations or instability affecting most neighbouring countries in the region. Gated communities, or “borey”, have spread like a fungus, occupying huge plots of land without any connecting streets, creating a landscape of fenced-off islands and increasing congestion.Mirrored glass shafts have sprouted a stone’s throw from Wat Phnom, including Terry Farrell’s grotesquely clumsy Vattanac Capital tower, apparently designed to look like the arched back of a dragon, “poised to leap into a new era of prosperity”. With a high-end shopping mall aimed at the country’s ultra-rich elite of business tycoons and MPs, known as “excellencies”, it is an empty symbol of a place still mired in kleptocracy.Documenting more than 140 buildings in detail, often for the first time – from precious religious sites to everyday apartment complexes – this new book not only provides a comprehensive guide, but makes a powerful argument to preserve the richly layered urban fabric, much of which now stands in the line of fire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3283e73cef024b7011da78d627e266acd8add250/0_262_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9d397133bfd98741a75962b032e3b9","title":"greta portrait of humanity 2020 shortlist in pictures","story":"A jockey in Belgrade, a barber in Havana, a famous young eco-warrior in Quebec ... the Portrait of Humanity prize captures the many vibrant faces of humanity around the world.

One day, “the water so clear and in so close that you could see the shoals in the mouth of the harbor ten fathoms deep”, he and his friends hook one – although the trip isn’t, eventually, as successful as they might like.“When we saw him we knew how really big he was. You couldn’t say it was frightening. But it was awesome,” writes Hemingway. “We saw him slow and quiet and almost unmoving in the water with his great pectoral fins like two long purple scythe blades. Then he saw the boat and the line started to race off the reel as though we were hooked to a motorcar, and he started jumping out to the northwest with the water pouring from him at each jump.”The author’s grandson, Seán Hemingway, told the New Yorker that he came across the typewritten manuscript when he was going through the Ernest Hemingway Collection at the John F Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston. “I am not sure why it received so little attention it is a gem among the unpublished material,” he said.Although the story is autobiographical, following the exploits of a narrator called Ernest Hemingway and his friends, Seán Hemingway said he preferred to think of it as invention.“It is carefully crafted and reads like a short work of fiction. As my grandfather wrote about his memoir A Moveable Feast, which he called fiction, a work of fiction may shed light on actual events,” he said. “It is certainly possible that the story was inspired by a particular fishing trip in the summer of 1933, when the story is set, but in my opinion it was more likely inspired by several different experiences, to which the author has added fictional elements that improve upon the story.”The work will be included in a\u0026nbspnew edition of The Old Man and the Sea, which was originally written in 1951. Seán Hemingway dated the unpublished story’s creation to “somewhere between 1936 and 1956”.He added that, while he did not see it “as notes” for his grandfather’s famous novella, “I do think that it makes a strong companion piece, since it is also about setting out to catch a very large marlin, and it shows in different ways how difficult that undertaking is, even with modern fishing equipment, a motor boat, and several experienced fishermen”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/060e2ad3be82417af78584fc4efa1f4a1bace457/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c6ed1ba70a6cead814d21fbda865abb","title":"tui and boeing agree deal on 737 max payout and delivery delays","story":"Holiday firm’s shares rise on news of payout for grounded planes and slowdown on ordersThe holiday operator Tui has agreed a deal with Boeing over compensation for the grounding of its 737 Max planes and to delay deliveries of new planes.Deliveries of 61 new planes to the Anglo-German group will be delayed by two years on average, and Boeing will pay most of the compensation within the next two years. Further details of the compensation have not been disclosed.All Boeing 737 Max planes have been grounded since March 2019 after design flaws contributed to two fatal crashes.Fritz Joussen, the chief executive of Tui Group, said: “The new delivery schedule gives us considerable flexibility because we will have fewer new aircraft delivered in the next years. This enables Tui to rapidly adapt its fleet growth to the currently challenging market environment.”The 737 Max crisis had already caused severe difficulties for airlines before the coronavirus pandemic all but wiped out air travel, prompting a scramble for cost savings and efforts to borrow from private investors and governments.The German flag carrier is burning through €800m a month of its cash buffers, which amounted to €4.3bn at the end of March. It reported a net loss of €2.1bn (£1.9bn) for the first three months of 2020, with almost €1bn spent on fuel price hedges rendered worthless when flights were grounded.Other European airlines have announced tens of thousands of redundancies.

On Wednesday, Wizz Air, the eastern European airline that is listed in London, reported a net profit of €281m for the year to 31 March and said its balance sheet was strong enough to weather the crisis.Wizz Air has also bucked the trend among the industry by expanding, opening new routes in eastern Europe as it positions for a rebound in travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266e2a8692cfd6db47f2812174fde8ae9361248f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=99c82ab8c9fead3034fdd53357076751","title":"being black public spaces outdoors perils christian cooper","story":"Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people’s physical safety. We need fundamental, consequential and absolute changeIn the summer of 1997, I lived in Seattle. I worked at a temp job while preparing to start my master’s degree in the fall.\u0026nbspI was walking to a bus stop after a day at the office, when I stepped into a pothole on the street and heard my ankle crack.\u0026nbspFeeling lightheaded and fearing I would black out, I limped in search of a payphone, and found that when I looked to passersby for help, no one stopped. I reached a corner and saw a young white man and woman with two kids. With tears in my eyes, I asked for their help.\u0026nbspBut like everyone else, they backed away and left me alone.As an African American woman who enjoys spending time outside, I have encountered this reaction – an absence of any desire, willingness or responsibility to engage – in both crowded cities and in nature.For black people, navigating both city streets and hiking trails can be charged at worst, they are fraught terrains where we are at the mercy of someone else’s interpretation of our presence. Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people’s physical safety.\u0026nbspAnd as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of Christian Cooper, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and George Floyd, the man who died with a police officer’s knee on his neck, illustrate.I have backpacked around the world and lived in Nepal and Kenya, and I’ve seen how my presence can be challenged or questioned. Earlier that year, when I lived in Seattle, I went hiking on Mt Baker with two white friends.\u0026nbspIt was a typically cloudy and cool day, and we stopped at the park lodge to warm up.\u0026nbspAt some point, my friends wandered off while I stood there with my colorful shawl wrapped around me.I began to feel uneasy I noticed an elderly, white woman staring at me.\u0026nbspSuddenly, she jumped (as did I).\u0026nbspShe then said: “My dear, I thought you were a beautiful, Indian statue.”\u0026nbspI was shocked, as I didn’t know whether to feel complimented (you’re beautiful) or insulted (I wasn’t even real).\u0026nbspNot to mention her complete misidentification of my racial and ethnic origins.My experiences backpacking through mountain trails and wildlife have forever changed the way I see and engage nature. I have channeled that passion into my work: I completed a PhD in geography, taught classes about the environment in our institutions of higher learning, written about the black experience of the outdoors, served on the national parks advisory board for eight years and work with environmental nonprofits and government agencies on ersity and environmental issues.\u0026nbspI am invested in finding ways to improve the quality of our relationship with the environment and our relationship to each other. But regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth.I wish I could feign surprise at what happened to Christian Cooper when he encountered Amy Cooper in Central Park.\u0026nbspI wish I could imagine it to be a blip in the United States’s history an accident, an outlier, not at all reflective of the truth of how black people are all too often treated.\u0026nbspBut I can’t.\u0026nbspWhen Amy Cooper threatened to tell the police that “an African American man is threatening her life”, she revealed what it’s like to know, deep down in your bones that she would be protected, valued and saved by virtue of her skin color.\u0026nbspBy calling the police, she exemplified what James Baldwin meant when he said that whiteness is about power.Our outrage as black people is justified.\u0026nbspLet me say that again.\u0026nbspOur outrage as black people is justified. As CNN commentator Don Lemon said recently: “The knee has always been on our neck.”\u0026nbspBut your outrage, white America, is not enough. What many of us want is fundamental, consequential and absolute change.The response to Amy Cooper by a justifiably angry public – the demands for her to lose her job, her dog and perhaps some “membership” in her community – is frustrating because it leaves me wanting.\u0026nbspNone of those measures would change the way Christian Cooper or any African American is perceived in any outdoor space, or any space for that matter.The revelations about Christian Cooper having gone to Harvard and how he sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society (which I’m thrilled to learn) should not matter as much as they seem to. This information helps us understand the passion and commitment he brings to birding. They do not confer his worth. At the end of day, it’s about everyone being protected, valued and if need be, saved, regardless of their station in life.\u0026nbspWhat happened between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper was, in many ways, simply an echo of what’s always been true in the US about our ability, as black people, to walk in the woods or on a city street.\u0026nbspWe are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd.\u0026nbspWhat can be done? We should recognize that systemic racism exists on both the streets of our cities and inside our national parks. We have to see full representation at every level in the environmental sector, and we need power structures to shift so that black and brown people are shaping policies and our national conversations. We need predominantly white environmental organizations and academic institutions to be more concerned with how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts black and brown people and give more resources to these communities. We need to change the prison industrial complex and law enforcement, which both undoubtedly shape how black people move through space.\u0026nbspThis is not about political correctness. These changes must be the product of something learned, understood, believed in and practiced by our institutions, our leaders and our communities.I believe that this country – which was founded on slavery and stolen land – can make a different choice, the same way Amy Cooper could have made a different choice. And I can aspire to live in a place where I will not be seen as an anomaly or something to fear or challenge, but instead, am embraced as a reflection of our common humanity that doesn’t deny our differences, but celebrates our possibilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c1758a150e07611f864fe81ccf69b0600c2ab3/0_363_5480_3290/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ba20001c8083d4cff1fcbfa6bd9914","title":"britain democracy tories coronavirus public power","story":"If the Tories’ coronavirus fiasco shows us anything, it’s that the public don’t have as much power as we’re led to believeDo we live in a democracy? You may well ask. An unelected adviser seems to exercise more power than the prime minister, and appears unanswerable to people or parliament. Boris Johnson makes reckless public health decisions that could put thousands of lives at risk, apparently to dig himself out of a political hole. Parliament is truncated, as the government arbitrarily decides that MPs can no longer take part in votes remotely. As the government blunders from one disaster to the next, there seem to be no effective ways of holding it to account.Established power in this country is surrounded by a series of defensive rings. As soon as you begin to name them, you see that the UK is a democracy only in the weakest and shallowest sense.Let’s begin with political funding. Our system permits billionaires and corporations to outspend and outmuscle the electorate. The great majority of money for the Conservative party comes from a small number of very rich people. Just five hedge fund managers have given it £18m over the past 10 years. The secretive Leader’s Group grants big donors special access to the prime minister and his frontbenchers in return for their money. Courting and cultivating rich people to win elections corrupts our politics, replacing democracy with plutocracy.This grossly unfair system is supplemented by outright cheating, such as breaching spending limits and secretly funding mendacious online ads. The Electoral Commission, which is supposed to regulate the system, has deliberately been kept powerless. The maximum fine for winning an election (or a referendum) by fraud is £20,000 per offence. Democracy is cheap in this country.The structure and symbolism of parliament, with its preposterous rituals and incomprehensible procedures, could scarcely be better designed to alienate people, or to favour former public schoolboys, educated in a similar environment. Even its official emblem tells us we are shut out. It’s a portcullis: the means by which people are excluded from the fortress of power. The portcullis is topped by a crown, reminding us that power is still vested symbolically in an unelected head of state. Many of her actual powers have been assumed, in the absence of a codified constitution, by the prime minister.These powers are routinely abused, by all governments. Prime ministers bypass parliament, governing through special advisers like Dominic Cummings. When they make catastrophic mistakes, they have the power to decide whether or not there should be a public inquiry, and, if there should, what its terms and who its chair should be. It’s as if a defendant in a criminal trial were allowed to decide whether the trial goes ahead and, if so, what the charges should be and who the judge and jury are.Even when an investigation does take place, the prime minister can suppress its conclusions, as Johnson has done with the report on Russian interference in the British political system, which remains unpublished. Does it contain details of unlawful donations to the Conservative party? Or of Conservative Friends of Russia, whose launch party was attended by Cummings? A key figure in this group was a man who has subsequently come under suspicion of being a Russian spy. He has been photographed with Johnson, whom he described as a “good friend”. What was going on? Without parliament’s intelligence and security committee’s report, we can only guess.The same inordinate powers enabled Johnson to suspend parliament last autumn, until his decision was struck down by the supreme court, and to terminate remote access for MPs this week, preventing many of them from representing us. He is, in effect, a monarch with a five-year term and a council of advisers we call parliament.The House of Lords is a further defensive ring within this ring. Some of its seats are reserved for hereditary aristocrats. Some are reserved for bishops, making this the world’s only country, other than Iran, in which religious leaders have an automatic right to sit. The rest are grace and favour appointments, keeping power within existing circles. Many of them are granted to major political donors, reinforcing the power of money. In any other country, they would call it corruption.\u0026nbspDespite a vast array of new democratic techniques, pioneered in other countries, there has been a total failure to balance our supposedly representative system with participatory democracy. This failure grants the winning party a scarcely challenged power, on the grounds of presumed consent, to do as it pleases, for five years at a time. Even when public trust and consent collapse, as they have now done amid the coronavirus pandemic, there are no effective channels through which we can affect the decisions government makes.These formal rings of power are supported by further defences beyond government, such as the print media, most of which is owned by billionaires or multimillionaires living offshore, and the network of opaquely funded thinktanks, that formulate and test the policies later adopted by government. Their personnel circulate in and out of the prime minister’s office.Our political system has the outward appearance of democracy, but it is largely controlled by undemocratic forces. We find ourselves on the wrong side of the portcullis, watching helplessly as crucial decisions are taken about us, without us. If there’s one thing the coronavirus fiascos show, it’s the need for radical change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62727f7210f98ed51330ed615e4cb19c7637cd44/0_204_3400_2041/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=065096e53253d97aa0112fd48832f1be","title":"pandemic no deal brexit vote leavers coronavirus","story":"The Vote Leavers at the heart of government think the coronavirus crash will disguise the pain caused by a rupture with the EUMost of us who have followed Brexit closely believed coronavirus would soften the government’s stance in trade talks with Europe. The economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and the fact Whitehall is so overwhelmed managing it, made it more likely the government would extend the transition period, due to expire at the end of this year, or strike a deal. It turns out that the opposite is true. Rather than encouraging a more flexible and pragmatic approach, Covid-19 has instead reinforced the case for no deal at the very top of government.Perhaps the most important driver is the belief among ministers that the UK economy will be permanently reshaped by the crisis, as companies create new supply chains and reshore production to provide greater resilience in the future, not least in case of another pandemic. The government wants a free hand to facilitate this change, one that it believes would be constrained by the EU’s demand that the UK remain tied to its labour and environmental standards and state aid rules.On the other side of the same coin, there are growing fears in cabinet that maintaining close EU ties would lock the UK into the EU’s post-Covid-19 economic measures designed for its 27 member states, with little regard for the UK’s interests.\u0026nbspThis is nonsense, as the\u0026nbspEU’s rescue package unveiled last Wednesday assumes no UK financial contribution. But it is a powerful argument on the Eurosceptic backbenches and has scared many in cabinet.Another\u0026nbspargument popular with backbench Brexiteers, but now more prominent among ministers, is the belief that coronavirus presents the government with an opportunity to “bury” the\u0026nbsploss of growth from no trade deal under the cover of the much more dramatic drop in GDP caused by coronavirus.The politics of this are very juicy for the Vote Leave team in the driving seat in government. Not least because it is only really a no deal that fully delivers on their substantive “ergence” agenda, while any\u0026nbspversion of a deal with the EU, no matter how distant, will ultimately tie the UK into EU rules and regulations in some way, an idea they hate and are loth to accept.\u0026nbspNo deal also\u0026nbspfacilitates a trade deal with the US, and the symbolism of “Global Britain” is key for ministers – far more important than the limited economic benefit a UK-US trade pact would bring.Time is also running out. Despite three rounds of talks so far, no progress has been made and negotiators on both sides are downbeat about the likelihood of a breakthrough this week.\u0026nbspBig gaps remain – in the UK over whether and how far to align to EU standards, the role of the European court of justice and the EU’s demands to fish in UK waters. But\u0026nbspthe government won’t extend the transition period. Boris Johnson believes he would struggle to sell to voters the extra £10bn in financial contributions and further spell of EU control of UK laws that this would bring.A political intervention on both sides will therefore be needed to move beyond the current stage. There will l be an opportunity this month, when Johnson meets the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, virtually, around the time of a long-planned EU leaders’ session in June to review progress.\u0026nbspBut the EU is unlikely to change its mandate and absent progress, ministers plan to make a judgment in September so they can give business clarity about the trading arrangements from 1 January. They may switch to assuming and preparing for no deal then.Finally, the survival of Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s closest adviser, despite allegations he broke the lockdown rules, also enhances the prospect of no deal. One reason why Brexiteer ministers and aides rallied behind him is that he sees it as his personal mission to prevent Johnson extending the transition period in June, and delivering a version of Brexit that lets the UK “take back control”. It would be wrong to underestimate his impact on the outcome of these negotiations.Of course, this could all be tactics and bluster. Johnson\u0026nbspand his cheerleaders on the backbenches have convinced themselves that such brinkmanship worked during the withdrawal agreement talks, so it is no real surprise they intend to repeat the trick now. Especially as they believe, wrongly, that coronavirus will make the EU more desperate to conclude a deal and buckle at the last moment. But Downing Street is right that December is the real deadline.Germany’s role will be key. I say this not as a naive Brit, believing that Angela Merkel will ride to Britain’s rescue, but as someone who has spent more than two decades studying and working on EU affairs. With Germany at the head of Europe’s rotating presidency, and Merkel in the final throes of her chancellorship, she will find it very hard to sign off on no deal. Of all of the EU’s member states, Germany has been the most focused on the longer-term, geopolitical risk of no deal, and the necessity for the UK and EU to maintain constructive ties.But even Merkel can’t and won’t save the UK from itself, and will not agree to a deal at any price.\u0026nbspIf the net effect of Covid-19 is that ministers see more benefit than cost from no deal, with the dominant view in cabinet now opposed to extending the transitional period, then that will indeed be the outcome at the end of this year.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/698a6c2745572c8d7ec7c14727f36efebcba5535/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7768a44b865e4eab6ba75e0071bfde66","title":"two in five schools in england yet to reopen to any more pupils","story":"Wales chooses different path as union poll finds two in five schools in England yet to reopen to more pupilsThe scale of the reopening of primary schools in England appears to have fallen far short of ministers’ expectations, with more than two in five schools failing to admit more pupils, according to the UK’s biggest education union.Primary schools were asked to admit children in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 from Monday, but a number of councils advised their schools against reopening prematurely while risk assessments continued. Many parents chose to keep their children at home.It came as the Welsh government said schools there would reopen to pupils at the end of June, almost a month after the phased reopening began in England.The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said schools would reopen on 29 June and the summer term would be extended by a week to 27 July, with plans for an additional week off at half term in the next\u0026nbspacademic year. Further education colleges will reopen from 15 June for face-to-face learning, especially\u0026nbspfor vulnerable students and those working towards a licence to practice assessments, she added.The NEU, which has more than 450,000 members, has consistently argued for a later reopening date, when the number of new infections will be lower and the system of testing, tracking and isolation of new cases will have bedded in.Kevin Courtney, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said the survey was a wake-up call for the government. He said many schools intended to delay a wider reopening and that some would not be able to admit all suggested year groups. A number would not take in any further pupils this term beyond the children of key workers and vulnerable children already attending, Courtney added.\u0026nbsp“It was always reckless of Boris Johnson to set an arbitrary date and expect schools to fall in line,” he said. “Heads and their staff know far more about their inidual challenges than Whitehall ever will. As the regional variation according to coronavirus levels show, schools are listening to the science rather than politicians.\u0026nbsp“Not only is the safety of the government’s plan in question but also the feasibility of it and confidence of headteachers in what the prime minister requested.”The Department for Education has yet to publish any data on pupils returning or schools opening more widely, but it is likely to say the numbers are in line with expectations and that this week is the first step in a gradual return of pupils, with numbers increasing in the coming weeks.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, acknowledged the efforts of school staff to prepare for a wider reopening. “I recognise there may continue to be some nervousness among families, but I want to reassure parents – and those working in schools and nurseries – that the welfare of children and staff continues to be at the heart of all of our considerations,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/488409673c8efb2ecd4d6531e6ef87876af53173/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9399da4461c17b1e56c75554c525da2","title":"air pollution in china back to pre covid levels and europe may follow","story":"Cleaner skies were a silver lining of pandemic but data indicates air quality receding as lockdowns easedAir pollution in China has climbed back to pre-pandemic levels, and scientists say Europe may follow suit.Air pollution causes at least 8m early deaths a year, and cleaner skies were seen as one of the few silver linings of Covid-19. Experts have called for action to help retain the air quality benefits of lockdowns, and measures taken to date have included expanding cycle lanes and space for walking in cities.“The rapid rebound in air pollution and coal consumption levels across China is an early warning of what a smokestack industry-led rebound could look like,” said Crea’s lead analyst, Lauri Myllyvirta. “Highly polluting industries have been faster to recover from the crisis than the rest of the economy. It is essential for policymakers to prioritise clean energy.”The energy consultancy group Wood Mackenzie predicts China’s oil demand will recover to near normal levels in the second quarter of 2020.Distinguishing the pollution changes caused by the lockdowns and their subsequent relaxations from other factors, such as weather and chemical interaction of pollutants, is complex. Spring is the most polluted season in western Europe in normal years, owing to the start of the agriculture cycle which causes ammonia emissions that go on to form particles over cities. The Cams team is now working with the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre to untangle these factors and produce robust estimates of the coronavirus effect.\u0026nbspPeuch said what happens next to air quality in European cities remained to be seen. “We do not know how people’s behaviour will change, for example avoiding public transport and therefore relying more on their own cars, or continuing to work from home.”Air pollution has been linked to heart and lung damage and many other conditions including diabetes and damaged intelligence. It is likely to affect virtually every organ in the body.There is growing evidence linking exposure to dirty air to increased risk of death from Covid-19, prompting calls to keep air pollution low to help avoid the dangers of a second wave of infection.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf13b4e1deb2b0046089c5be6577640c0a2068fd/0_0_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=979db98879cabb27356023e655df5f05","title":"living near oil and gas wells linked to low birthweight in babies","story":"Risk is greater in rural areas, according to study of nearly 3 million births over 10 yearsLiving near active oil and gas wells during pregnancy increases the risk of low-birthweight babies, especially in rural areas, according to the largest study of its kind.Researchers analysed the records of nearly 3 million births in California to women living within 6.2 miles (10km) of at least one oil or gas well between 2006 and 2015. It is the first such study to look at birth outcomes in rural and urban areas, and to women living near active and inactive oil and gas sites.\u0026nbspProximity to a well and the level of production were found to be significantly associated with poor birth outcomes.\u0026nbspEven among full-term births, babies born to mothers living close to wells were on average 1.3 ounces (36 grams) smaller than those of their counterparts.Newborns are deemed to have low birthweight when they weigh less than 5lb and 8oz. It can lead to multiple short-term development issues as small babies often struggle to eat, gain weight and fight infections. Studies also suggest small- and low-birthweight babies are more likely to have medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and intellectual and developmental disabilities in later life.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAbout one in 12 babies in the US have a low birthweight.The study found a link between oil and gas wells and small babies born in urban areas, but it was significantly less marked than in rural communities. Differences in air quality, maternal occupation and housing conditions may have contributed to the urban-rural ide.\u0026nbspNationwide, oil and gas production has risen significantly in recent years thanks to the expansion of non-conventional, hyper-polluting extraction techniques such as fracking. In 2011, during Barack Obama’s first term in office, the US surpassed Russia as the world’s largest natural gas producer, and in early 2018 it overtook Saudi Arabia\u0026nbspas the leading producer of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).\u0026nbspActive and inactive oil and gas sites create myriad environmental hazards including air and water pollutants, noise and excessive lighting, which have all been linked with poor health outcomes.“This scientific evidence of adverse health effects facing vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, should be taken into account as Californians debate the extent to which we want to expand oil and gas drilling in our state.” \u0026nbspFour of America’s 10 largest oil fields are in California. However, oil production in California has declined over the past three decades, and generally the state has older, more conventional oil and gas sites than other parts of the US, and a larger number of inactive sites.\u0026nbspBut many of the sites in California also use newer techniques such as fracking and steam and water injection to access hard-to-reach oil reserves, said the study’s co-author Kathy Tran, a graduate student in environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley.Stricter regulations on new fracking permits were issued last year, but the state issued 24 new fracking permits in early April, and another 282 are awaiting review.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18c7f4ce40cda8d7b5005879b827d5320ef2cf6/0_168_4197_2518/master/4197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55d3111cecf14f29f67f8ea183348577","title":"world oceans day tell us about issues affecting your local ocean","story":"World Oceans Day is a moment to celebrate the ocean and reflect on how to protect it.

There are tiered al-fresco frocks with folksy embroidery, such as the dreamy lilac number from \u0026amp Other Stories, above. The women who spent last winter wearing modishly austere, Little Women-esque prairie-style long-sleeve, high-neck dresses with ankle boots to the office are now to be found in pale florals and ruffle-trimmed picture necklines.The picnic dress is the new tracksuit. If the tracksuit was the uniform of Stay at Home, the picnic dress is Have Fun (but Sensibly, and Outside.) This is what a picnic dress stands for. Polka dots and florals are upbeat, but civilised. Smocking and puffed sleeves are summery without being provocative. Even the many gatherings in my local park, which are picnics in the impromptu sense – silvery tins of gin and tonic from the Tesco Express over the road, 99 Flakes from the ice-cream van – feature women adorned with vintage florals and delicately gathered pintucks.The psychology of the picnic dress is fascinating. Is it OK to wear celebration frocks in a pandemic? Where does Keep Calm and Carry On end, and Marie Antoinette at the Petit Trianon begin? No one knows the answer to these questions, which is precisely why the picnic dress is emerging as the go-to summer look. The iconography of picnicking, with its teddy bears and wicker baskets, is wholesome fun rather than hedonistic abandon. If we can agree that it is acceptable – even desirable – to find joy and love and beauty where we can, in the midst of all this, then the picnic dress channels summery pleasures at an appropriate pitch. Broderie anglaise says, I am here with my friends and family, and not to swap bodily fluids with randoms. Gingham says, I will go home before it gets dark and I start bumping into each people.And picnic dressing is more practical than it looks, as we head into a time of daycations and staycations. The unseasonable heatwave of the past week has given us an easy ride into a summer in which it seems that what socialising we are able to do will mostly take place outdoors. Al-fresco dressing in the British summer means keeping warm as well as keeping cool, and a picnic aesthetic works in scenarios where your swimwear-and-beach-cover-up holiday wardrobe will not. A good picnic dress knows how to look summery without being skimpy, which is useful on days when it is a bit goosebumpy in the shade. A picnic dress can be fitted around the waist but it will be loose around the thighs, which is important because it means you can sprawl comfortably on a blanket rather than clamp your knees demurely as necessitated by sitting on the floor in a short skirt. Oh, and a picnic dress is always a dress, not a jumpsuit. If your al-fresco socialising is taking place anywhere other than your own garden, this is a time for a dress, not a jumpsuit.And picnic dressing isn’t just about the dress. Love Shack Fancy, an American brand with an irresistible Laura-Ashley-goes-to-LA sunny-boho vibe, is the escapist fantasy shopping label of the moment, not just for dresses but for gossamer-fine cardigans – the Folley, in a wool-mohair blend with vintage style rose buttons, comes in a perfect summer-sky blue. Shoes should be easy to slide off, for picnic blanket etiquette. The Loupe sandal by Dune \u0026nbspwill work as brilliantly on holiday, if you should ever get one, as it does in the park. This strangest of summers calls for uncomplicated clothes. Real life isn’t exactly a picnic right now.

Fionn O’Shea plays Eddie, a high-school kid preparing for his leaving certificate in County Kildare in Ireland his dad, Ian (Barry Ward), is a senior army officer at the nearby barracks at the Curragh Camp and expects Eddie to follow in his footsteps. Meanwhile, Amber (Lola Petticrew) is a disaffected teenager in Eddie’s year who yearns to escape to what she imagines to be the punk nirvana of London.What Eddie and Amber have in common is that they are secretly gay, and people are beginning to whisper about their apparent lack of interest in dating the opposite sex. So of course they find it mutually convenient to be each other’s beard, creating the public fiction of being a couple to get the homophobes off their backs. But this creates a strangely intense relationship between them that isn’t easily shrugged off when real romantic-partner candidates come into view.It’s a well-meaning film that seeks to portray gay identity without problematising it unduly there are obvious echoes of the recent Netflix drama Sex Education –\u0026nbspwhich could have got nowhere near the screens in the 90s. But it’s all a bit earnest and derivative and sometimes a bit lachrymose, despite some perfectly decent performances.There is a lovely, warm speech at the end from Sharon Horgan playing Eddie’s mum. For me, this needed a bit more of an original spark.• Dating Amber is available on Amazon Prime Video from 4 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d8f6b4aa91a06268954fb81a7e43d63675c6708/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b318bbcdcb6cb9c3aeff5cabdd8efd3e","title":"17 lip smacking recipes for leftover roast chicken","story":"Once your Sunday lunch is over, you have to find a way to use up the leftovers. Here are some miraculous ways to make that chicken disappear – from rich risottos to fragrant soupsIn normal times, a whole roast chicken can create unwanted obligations: once Sunday lunch is over, you’ve got to find way to use up the leftover bits within the week. Sometimes I manage it sometimes the remains get ided up between the dog and the cat on Thursday.\u0026nbspNow that we’ve got the time and space to plan, all that’s required is a little inspiration. Here are 17 miraculous ways to make a whole chicken disappear.\u0026nbspFirst, we need to roast the chicken. As the co-author of Roast Chicken and Other Stories, Simon Hopkinson is something of an authority on the matter. His version is a good place to start – it’s not fussy, but it is particular.I tend to roast a chicken according to the first recipe I consulted on the subject: Marcella Hazan’s chicken with two lemons. It doesn’t require anything beyond the lemons and some salt, plus a bit of string to truss up the chicken’s legs. The major innovation here is cooking the bird upside down for the first half hour, before turning it breast side up. If you do everything right, it comes out of the oven puffed up like a balloon. During lockdown, I’ve achieved acceptable results with minor variations, including chicken with one lemon and chicken with a half a lemon.\u0026nbspIf you’re in a hurry, a spatchcocked chicken will take less time, and you can also cook it in a big frying pan or on a barbecue. Spatchcocking is easily mastered – it’s almost harder to say than it is to do – as long as you have got good kitchen scissors (this video tutorial is just over a minute long). I highly recommend Rachel Roddy’s chicken\u0026nbspalla diavola\u0026nbsprecipe for chicken cooked this way. You need something heavy to pin the chicken to the pan. I use a 7lb (3kg) iron weight from an old set of scales.When you’ve had your fill, pull all the remaining meat off the chicken and put it in the fridge, then use the carcass to make stock. Along with the chicken and the water, stock usually includes an onion, a few carrots, a couple of celery stalks, parsley, possibly some leeks, peppercorns, thyme and a bay leaf or two. Don’t worry too much about leaving out a few of these – and don’t be tempted to chuck in random vegetables – not everything works. The simpler it is, the more versatile it will be. Basic instructions can be found here.\u0026nbspOnce you’ve got stock and chicken, you are ready to make chicken soup. A lot of soup recipes call for a whole fresh chicken, which defeats our purpose. This one doesn’t, and it can serve as a solid template for any experimental variation.\u0026nbspFor something a trifle more exotic, Nigella Lawson’s thai chicken soup can be made from the store cupboard, as long as you consider tamarind paste a store cupboard ingredient (I’m not saying it isn’t one, I’m just saying I don’t have any). It’s remarkably forgiving and still works well when you’ve missed out a few ingredients, or don’t have much chicken left over.\u0026nbspAcross hundreds of Sunday nights I relied on a post-roast chicken and rice staple known in our house as spicey ricey. So unpopular did this dish eventually become that, when threatened with it again one evening, my youngest son stormed into the kitchen and started making risotto. I couldn’t quite believe what I was seeing – it was like watching a cat install a satellite dish.What he produced that night was a surprisingly delicious conflation of the two Nigel Slater recipes found here – risotto with pancetta\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspblue cheese. And he put chicken in it. That was the end of spicey ricey.\u0026nbspAlong with the meat and bones, a roasted chicken will supply you with a good amount of fat which, according to Tom Hunt, can be whipped into a versatile substitute for butter, or a tasty spread you can put on toast. His chicken butter keeps in the fridge for up to two months, giving you plenty of time to get your head round the idea.Jamie Oliver’s roast chicken pasta requires intention – the chicken is cooked specially for the dish, with a sauce coming together in the roasting pan. It’s good, but it does leave us back at square one, leftovers-wise.\u0026nbspNigel Slater’s pasta with roast chicken and pine kernels is a more opportunist dish\u0026nbsp– as long as you’ve got a leftover chicken, you can decide to make this at the last minute. It’s sort of a winter thing, but it would still suit a rainy summer evening.\u0026nbspThis leftover chicken and bacon pasta from Chris Collins is slightly eccentric – it’s got sweet chilli sauce in it – but it’s perfect for a night when even the store cupboard is looking a bit bare.\u0026nbspSlater again: his asparagus with chicken and basil dressing is almost too simple to call a salad. The key to it is the dressing, which should be made at the last minute.\u0026nbspChicken and freekeh salad with salsa verde requires a bit more chopping, but that’s all. If you don’t like freekeh, or don’t know what it is, you could easily substitute bulgar wheat or couscous. We’re only dressing up leftover chicken, after all, so it makes sense to work with what you’ve got.\u0026nbspIf you’re fortunate enough to have some stale bread on hand, Thomasina Miers’s chicken panzanella salad needs only the addition of good tomatoes, capers, anchovies, basil, peppers and an onion to create something considerably more elegant than the sum of its parts.\u0026nbspIf you’ve still got any chicken left, you can try this leftover chicken pad thai, the historical curiosity that is coronation chicken or Jackie Middleton’s delicious, if unprepossessing, cheesy bake.\u0026nbspWhen Sunday comes, it starts all over again.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fd3a0d2236028e0039a0a7c59f526780fb1d063/0_889_10312_6188/master/10312.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e8e61047598ea8d9b07b3c5bde784cdd","title":"nigel slater recipe chicken with marsala and creme fraiche","story":"Plump juicy chicken in a piquant cream and herb sauceLightly season 2 plump chicken breasts. Warm 3 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan, add 40g of butter and, when it melts, add the 2 breasts, skin side down.Keeping the heat fairly low so that the butter bubbles lazily, leave the chicken breasts to cook for 10 minutes. Baste the meat regularly and check its progress, turning the breasts over when the skin is golden. Remove them from the pan and keep warm under foil or an upturned bowl.Pour 100ml of marsala, white wine or vermouth into the pan and turn up the heat.

Enough for 2.The way to success here is by keeping a careful eye on the temperature. If the butter and oil get too hot, they will burn and leave you nothing interesting with which to make the accompanying sauce. Watch the chicken’s progress, lowering the heat as necessary to cook it through without burning the butter. Cover with a lid if it appears to be cooking too quickly.You could make this dish with small pieces of chicken instead of a breast and use it as a pasta sauce. There is no reason why you shouldn’t introduce a handful of halved button mushrooms with the chicken.

That’s one of the reasons I love football, you just don’t know what is round the corner. As much as people want to plan, it’s such a reactive game. Things on a daily or weekly basis can change your future.”Twelve months ago the goalkeeper had not featured in the closing stages of a Bournemouth season during which Premier League status was comfortably retained. If an exit from the Vitality Stadium seemed likely, nobody could have reasonably predicted what happened next.Begovic spent the first half of the 2019-20 campaign with Qarabag, where a Europa League campaign delivered useful distraction from the Azerbaijan domestic scene. By January he found himself in an altogether different movie as Pepe Reina’s move from Milan to Aston Villa left the Italian club needing an experienced goalkeeper to work alongside Gianluigi Donnarumma.“He can be anything he wants to be,” Begovic says of the 21-year-old. “He is one of the top goalkeepers in the world right now and if he keeps going like this it’s only a matter of time before he becomes unanimously the best. He is phenomenal, a huge talent and a good guy too, with a very good work rate. What he has already achieved in the game is quite remarkable really. I can only see good things in the future for him.”If Donnarumma is the boy wonder, Begovic can also derive thrills from playing and training alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The return of the Swede, now 38, to Milan triggered scenes of euphoria. “He has had such a huge impact his personality, his leadership, his quality on the pitch,” says Begovic. “The best thing about him is how competitive he is. At his age, he is still pushing every day to be the best. He is a team player in so many ways, his standards make everyone else better. He can change games with presence.” In short? “A world-class player who is a joy to watch.”As Milan and other Serie A clubs returned to training three weeks ago, Italy assessed the grim impact of coronavirus. Begovic and his family returned to England, their home of 15 years, soon after the season was halted in early March. They watched the trauma in northern Italy from afar. “When I first came back, nobody was in the streets and there was absolutely nothing happening,” says the 32-year-old. “It seems like now we are getting back to somewhat normal life again.”Football, naturally given the Italian psyche, seems key. “I think that’s been a huge factor in trying to get back as soon – and as safely – as possible here,” Begovic says. “It’s part of the culture, part of the religion here, especially in Milan. If we can bring it back for people then that should be positive all round. There has been a real collective effort across the country.“Training has been absolutely fine. So far the club and everyone involved has done a great job and you don’t feel uncomfortable at all. It has been tough, like pre-season really, but it’s awesome after such a long break to be back doing what we love doing. It is an honour to be part of this club. I have come to Milan and seen what this club means.”Begovic, who left war-gripped Bosnia as a four-year-old, was thinking of others long before coronavirus took hold. His expanding goalkeeper academy, with bases in Bosnia and England, involves 10 coaches presiding over 60 youngsters. Such is its popularity that there are regular calls to offer outfield classes, too. Lockdown did not stall the project. “We have tried to keep the kids engaged as much as we can, through Zoom and other technology. We have had online sessions, video analysis, educational sessions. The parents have been thankful for a bit of purpose as well.Begovic’s academy has partnered FirstPoint with a view to providing US scholarships. His younger brother, Denis, is a student in North Carolina. “We want to open up as many opportunities as possible some kids have been picked up by professional clubs, some by semi-professional clubs and the thing missing was a north American route,” the goalkeeper says. “That gives you so many opportunities NCAA from a sporting point of view but also education and life experience as well. We want to give our kids every opportunity to stay in the game.”Bournemouth’s upcoming mission is to remain in the Premier League. If Begovic is even remotely bitter about circumstances on the south coast, he hides it perfectly. Perhaps present surroundings would deem any such sentiment laughable in any case. “I hope things work out for them, of course,” says Begovic. “There are some superb people at that club and a very good manager. With the people at the helm and the people running the team there, I’d be confident things will be all right. It’s a club that has done so many of the right things.” Begovic’s own dedication continues to pay idends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8000c58952c616ebec1c04592acb6e91210048/0_128_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8406601c2458d6467f63de0d37ad4ac1","title":"the fiver primeira liga portugal porto benfica","story":"Sign up now!

Bruno Fernandes had made a fine start to life in England after his arrival from Sporting in January, yet others had dipped. Having looked back at the last six rounds of fixtures, here are the 10 players who were enjoying the best form before the league was suspended in March.Matt Doherty has been instrumental in Wolves’ bid for a Champions League spot this season and he played a pivotal role in their five-game unbeaten run before the lockdown. The Republic of Ireland international scored the opening goal in Wolves’ 3-2 victory at Tottenham on 1 March, having set up a goal in their 3-0 win over Norwich the previous week. The full-back also made 15 tackles in that unbeaten run. Rating: 7.40After a strong start it had been a difficult debut season for Sébastien Haller, though the Frenchman was showing signs of a return to form before the break. The striker scored his seventh goal of the season in the Hammers’ last home game – a 3-1 win over Southampton – winning a massive 14 aerial duels and even completing four dribbles. The absent fans will be hoping for more of the same once the action resumes. Rating: 7.46He has seemingly fallen down the pecking order in the England set-up, but James Tarkowski has enjoyed another impressive season for Burnley, excelling since the turn of the year in particular. A man mountain at the back, he played a key role in Sean Dyche’s side keeping four clean sheets from their last six matches, winning 29 aerial duels in that time and blocking 12 shots. Rating: 7.46An answer in many a lockdown football quiz, Harvey Barnes scored the last Premier League goal before lockdown in Leicester’s convincing 4-0 win over Aston Villa with what was his second of the game. The youngster certainly enjoyed home comforts before the break, having also scored in matches against West Ham and Chelsea at the King Power Stadium since the turn of the year. He mustered an impressive 15 shots in his last six outings. Rating: 7.47Richarlison has thrived since Carlo Ancelotti took over at Goodison Park and will be hoping to pick up where he left off. The Brazilian scored in four of his last seven appearances pre-lockdown. He was playing in a more central position and was forming a strong partnership with Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Rating: 7.47While some will suggest that the money spent on the England international was excessive – it was a world record fee for a defender, after all – but Maguire has had a very positive impact on United’s defensive resolve. He has been given the captaincy and has shown real leadership from the back. The 27-year-old was in top form earlier in the year, helping the club to four clean sheets in a five-match unbeaten run before the break. United have been strong at the back. They have reached the FA Cup quarter-finals without conceding a goal and have only conceded three in nine Europa League games. Rating: 7.49Another summer signing at Old Trafford who has undoubtedly come good since the turn of the year – if not before – Aaron Wan-Bissaka was beginning to show more attacking quality to complement his unquestionable defensive work. His tally of 14 dribbles in his last six outings attest to as much. He also maintained his impressive tackling numbers, with 21 in that time. Rating: 7.52If Dwight McNeil can maintain the form he was showing before the lockdown, he will certainly be competing for a place in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the European Championship next summer. His delivery from the left wing has been superb, with his crossed gobbled up with glee by the likes of Chris Wood. McNeil created 13 chances in his five appearances before the league was suspended. The 20-year-old’s industry has also been invaluable, with 15 tackles in his last six outings to complement a recent goal and assist against Bournemouth. Rating: 7.57While many feel this has been the Egyptian’s weakest season in a Liverpool shirt – ironically, in the Reds’ finest in Premier League history – Salah seemed keen to prove a point prior to the break. Five goals from his last six league appearances have thrust the forward right back into the running for what would be a third consecutive Golden Boot, while chipping in with 15 successful dribbles in that time. Rating: 7.59Liverpool may have dominated the season, but Kevin De Bruyne has been the league’s top inidual performer. He has set up 16 goals this season. To put that in some context, Trent Alexander-Arnold (on 12) is the only other player in double figures and the all-time Premier League record is 20 in one season, set by Thierry Henry in 2002-03. De Bruyne was at his creative best before the league was suspended, setting up four goals in his last six appearances.

Can you share food – or a hug? Scientists and etiquette experts weigh inFrom this week the lockdown rules in England have relaxed – groups of up to six can meet in an outdoor space, so long as they stay two metres apart. Anyone who can’t work from home has already been told to go back to work – while avoiding public transport. The sceptics among us smell a rat – with the alert level the same and the government’s five tests unmet, track-and-trace not ready and a government desperate to deflect attention from its shortcomings – is this easing really for our benefit, or just a way to kick responsibility back on to the population?\u0026nbspIn other words, we are living in one giant grey area, where judgment, common sense, good faith and, most of all, manners are going to be doing a hell of a lot of heavy lifting. So what advice do the etiquette experts – and the boffins – offer?\u0026nbspWilliam Hanson, an etiquette coach and host of the podcast Help I Sexted My Boss, was born to answer this question. “There was an awful tendency, before all this, to respond to an invitation with: ‘Who else is going to be there?’” (This implies you are checking that it will be cool enough, and is beyond rude.) “Now it is permissible, even healthy, to ask that. But you may still want to disguise the question, so if you’re bringing a cake or a homemade cordial, say: ‘Let me know how many it will be for.’” No manners specialist in town has given me an acceptable get-out for turning up only to find a packed party. Talk numbers before you arrive and then, as Debora Robertson, the co-author of Manners: A Modern Field Guide (out next spring), says: “It’s your job to express clearly what you need in a social situation, so just say: ‘I’m not ready yet for that.’” After that, it’s all in the tone and the intention. “If it’s not your intention to make people feel like they’re reckless or stupid, then that won’t come across in your tone.”\u0026nbspAgain, if you explain yourself plainly and make it a boundary of yours, a decent friend will accept that even if they think you are extremely cautious. Adam Collins, a doctor of emergency medicine, says: “If everything is washed and clean, and everyone, while they’re there, has their own inidual set of plates and cups, that should be fine.”\u0026nbspYou are now allowed to use someone else’s toilet if you wipe down surfaces afterwards. If you don’t want people to use your loo, tell them before they arrive. Regardless, Diana Mather, the author of The Good Manners Bears and host of the Granny Manners YouTube channel, has this timeless piece of advice: “Make sure you go before you leave.”If you’re happy for people to use your loo, Hanson says: “I would, as a host, put Dettol wipes out. I would hope that people got what I was trying to imply.” As a guest, you don’t then need to be sheepish about having cleaned the toilet, because they in effect told you to do that. I know. This is all getting pretty intense.\u0026nbspAccording to Mather, absolutely not as long as you would normally. The longer you are there, the more some of you will drink, the less observant of social distancing you will become, the more of an awkward spot you will put anxious friends and relatives in. It’s not a four-hour gig. It would be polite, as a host, to set the terms – shall we have a drink between six and seven? – “And if it gets to seven and people are still chatting,” Mather says, “you can push it to half past seven.” How do you make people leave, though? This bit is easy, apparently. “You stand up,” Mather says authoritatively. “Everyone should take that hint.”There is no way to not offer these around, yet I’m struggling to see how you would get a Quaver off someone without coming closer than two metres, so it’s sort of a pass-agg move. You’re asking them to either break the rules or make a big deal out of not breaking them. I think you just have to eat these things privately, or buy more than one bag of Quavers.At a whole population level, public health agencies are trying to move people away from buffet-style eating, where you are all digging in to the same bowl, and a large number of people are using the same serving spoon. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t safely cut a cake for six people or prepare salads for people.Hanson says: “If it’s a serious breach that is breaking the rules, then fine. But be prepared, if it becomes known who reported them, that is a serious breach of friendship and you probably won’t be friends with them going forward.” Robertson is more trenchant: “We’ve all got to stop the grassing-up thing. It came too easily to some people.” I think, from both a moral and manners perspective, no.\u0026nbspIt’s really up to you, but don’t leave things because you feel embarrassed or awkward. Robertson says: “Phone them up, or email, or send a postcard to re-establish connection. Just be normal, don’t be weird.”Remember, too, that it’s not all about you. We all have a tendency to blame ourselves when communication breaks down, but it takes two not to tango. “There’s this brilliant story in the Duchess of Devonshire’s autobiography,” Robertson says. “She’s upstairs on her wedding day, and she’s waiting to come down, and 85 million people are waiting to see her. And she says to her mother: ‘I feel a bit shy.’ And her mother says: “Don’t be ridiculous, nobody’s looking at you.’” I mean, it is brilliant. But mothers are also weird.\u0026nbspI am currently going with: “I have nothing to say and I hate Zoom.”Collins takes the point: “Given that you’re allowed to have as many different sets of six people as you want, to me, that’s no different to having a barbecue of 12.” This is the moment at which you berate them with science. The magic number is because any group larger than six finds it hard to stay in the same conversation, at two metres apart, so will naturally start to cluster together. Just be reasonable, is the overall medical message here.\u0026nbspSomeone doing it by accident can be repelled by a light remark. With a deliberate offender, Hanson says, you have to be firm. “You have got to step in and say: ‘It’s two metres, I’d appreciate if you would respect that.’ I wouldn’t say sorry, necessarily. Keep it short. If you soften it too much, it will weaken the impact. I know some of my friends probably would transgress, and I just won’t meet up with them until this is over.”Children are relatively unaffected by Covid and yet Covid\u0026nbspis all we think about. But there’s a danger that because of this we might forget about their other needs altogether. Heneghan counsels strongly against this. “There’s been a lack of thinking about our younger generation, right across the board up to university age. They are at such low risk, them going back to school is no more risky than it is after Christmas, when there’s been an outbreak of influenza.” They need education, but they also need fellowship, play, fresh air and normality. So yes, they should be allowed to play with one another. If they are too young to observe any meaningful social distance, you just have to chase them apart (try not to be terrifying).Heneghan says: “I got into a car with a person on Saturday. I’m also an urgent care GP, he had to drive me around. The important point here is that we’ve come through an era where, if you’re ill, you take a paracetamol and carry on. That has to end. The important alertness is that if you feel unwell, you have to take it seriously and get yourself a test.”Collins gives something close to a definitive answer on this, and all things: “What people should focus on is not: ‘Can I do this specific thing?’ It’s: ‘What am I doing here that is genuinely beneficial or genuinely necessary?’ Lockdown is driving us all a little bit crazy and it affects some people’s mental health in really serious ways.” It’s really not as simple as: “Responsible people stay locked down for ever” and very few rules are absolute. “You have to ask yourself, honestly, whether you’re doing everything you can to protect yourself and protect others.”Oh, hello fresh minefield. Alan Redman is an organisational psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London, with a sideline in the psychology of commuter cycling. His top manners tips are: “One, wavesmile at other riders. Always. Two, don’t shout at drivers or pedestrians. Three, don’t overtake and then immediately slow down.” More broadly, he says, there is too much focus on commuting being terrifying – it is at the start, but people overcome that fairly fast and afterwards get a huge sense of zeal from their sense of legitimacy on the road and their feeling of having sailed over the fear barrier.\u0026nbspAs it is allowed for two people to meet, there is no reason you can’t go out on a date, so long as you can cope with pubs not being open. Given the two-metre distance, however, you probably can’t do much else. There is a hilarious legal loophole, here – as of this week it is illegal for two people from different households to meet indoors and have sex. The rules around outdoor gatherings, however, are guidance not law, so in theory you could breach your two-metre rule and have sex in the garden without getting arrested. So long as you weren’t overlooked, which would of course breach another law. And so long as there were six of you. No, wait …\u0026nbspYou can continue to hug members of your own household. You can definitely hug any of the six people you have just had outdoor sex with, in for a penny etc (joke! This is a joke). People I’ve been extremely tempted to hug include those who have definitely had the virus already, with the antibody test to prove it, and those who are at the end of their lives and claim not to care whether they get it or not. The expert advice remains: do not hug any of these people.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6d584f0cc9b85851ae568c6b0dd9e69f","title":"england easing out of lockdown is it safe podcast","story":"Health officials and even government scientists have warned against the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, saying it could lead to a surge in infections. David Hunter, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford, looks at the risks Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more. This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not fall precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later. Those restrictions have meant the R0 now appears to be below 1.0 in the UK, and on Monday the government eased some of the lockdown rules, allowing people to meet outside in groups of up to six, outdoor markets and car showrooms to begin operating again, and schools to reopen. But is it actually safe? David Hunter, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, talks to Rachel Humphreys about the risks involved in lifting lockdown too early.

By Wednesday morning, 254,764 people had put their names to it.The petition says: “Farming throughout the UK has high standards of safety and welfare\u0026nbspwith an ambition to be net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. There are very strict controls on farming methods allowed in the UK and I expect the same of all food which is imported here so the food I eat is as safe, traceable and produced to high welfare and environmental standards.“Before the UK begins to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world, I call on the UK government to put into law rules that prevent food being imported to the UK which is produced in ways that would be illegal here.”Imports that are of particular concern to UK farmers and producers include US poultry products, such as chlorinated chicken and eggs, and hormone-injected beef.The TV chef Jamie Oliver issued a plea on social media for people to sign the petition, saying if there was no law to protect standards, the market would be flooded with very low quality, high salt and sugar products, and that trade deals allowing these imports would be “traumatic” to the British farming industry.The agriculture bill is moving to the House of Lords. Neil Parish, the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee, who put forward one of the amendments to the bill in the Commons, said he hoped the Lords would amend the bill in order to protect against substandard imports in trade deals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324953b35e1e542df687f0a0687867f2b40cf832/0_36_1086_652/master/1086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07e635389347d42dfeb63e8912098405","title":"lost father covid 19 legal action against uk government","story":"Dr Minesh Talati wants accountability not just for his father’s death, but the other coronavirus victims who didn’t need to dieI took my father into hospital on 20 March, because I was sure he had coronavirus. We walked in together. He had worked for 46 years as a community pharmacist and I am a dentist. Neither of us had any idea that his situation would deteriorate to the point that I would be turning off his ventilator four weeks later.My 74-year-old mother also got Covid-19, as did my pregnant wife. They recovered, but I could easily have lost all of them. I believe my father’s death, like so many others, didn’t need to happen. I want transparency, clarification of the facts and accountability not just for me, but for the tens of thousands of people who have lost loved ones.We need an inquiry, but more urgently, given that we’re still in the middle of the crisis, we need to learn from mistakes. That is all I have ever asked for and that is why I’m taking legal action against the government and Public\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspEngland (PHE), on the basis that the health secretary and PHE failed to comply with their duties under the Human Rights Act regarding the right to life.I knew something was wrong. I had a high heart rate, which I thought was strange. I managed to get a private test done which came back positive for Covid-19. I was ultra-worried because I’d seen my parents before I had symptoms. My father had otherwise been isolating because of his age, like I had told him to.Assuming a median incubation period of five to six days as the medical papers suggest, followed by seven days of symptoms, I must have caught Covid-19 at the end of February. On 13 March, over a week before lockdown was introduced, the scientific advisory group of emergencies (Sage) concluded “there are more cases in the UK than previously thought and we may therefore be further ahead of the epidemic curve”.Even though he was 80, my dad was very fit. When I took him in to hospital, the ward was half-empty. A few days later it was packed. Staff were off because they had symptoms and couldn’t get tested. There were so many bank nurses who were stretched and not used to working in an environment of infection. I could see how things would escalate.My dad didn’t want to die. He survived for weeks on the ventilator but his doctors and I knew that if he ever came off it, he wouldn’t be able to lead the life he had done before. He would have hated that. I went into a side room with the consultant’s permission in full personal protective equipment which I had bought Dad was unconscious and heavily sedated. I held his hand and said, “Dad, I’m really sorry that I couldn’t keep the promise I made you four weeks ago saying you’d be home by the end of the week.” I said I should have been more wary, that it should be me in that bed.It was so painful and surreal. Sometimes I still can’t acknowledge it happened, I think I’m having a bad dream.I believe the health secretary did not do all that could reasonably be expected to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which he had knowledge.Why did the government stop testing in those early days? Why didn’t it inform us when it knew there was community transmission in February? The UK doesn’t have the second highest mortality rate in the world for no reason. If the government and PHE had put this information in the public domain, and people still broke the rules of lockdown, that would have been different. It would have been because they’d disobeyed something the government had done to protect us.Lives would have been lost under Covid-19 but I believe if the government and PHE had acted sooner with the information that they had, the death rate would have been substantially lower.Once these matters are addressed hopefully we can prevent this from ever happening again. There will be more clusters of coronavirus and there may well be a second wave. We need to learn from the mistakes now, rather than later.More information can be found here: www.crowdjusticecaseholding-the-government-to-account"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a41952f75465c3c298f778df91c5d4f8d98b5c/278_0_1363_818/master/1363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d025de9609225f7c18795aecdcddf9","title":"they used to call me retard dark time dying inside shaun webster mbe learning disability","story":"Shaun Webster once faced abuse, but now has an MBE for helping others with a learning disability, he reveals in a new book I am standing on my dad’s doorstep. It’s 20 years since he called me a retard. I haven’t seen much of him since then. He told me I’d never work, never live on my own, never have a relationship. I came on the bus from the flat where I live alone. I’ve got an ex-girlfriend standing next to me for moral support. I haven’t told my dad I’m coming.He opens the door. He smells of booze. He looks at me, confused.“All right, Dad? You still a pisshead?”“You can’t talk to me like that!” he says.“Why not?” I say. “You’ve said so much bad stuff to me. You told me I’d never have a job, never live on my own. I’ve been abroad, Dad. I’ve met Prince Charles. He gave me this MBE.” I hold up the medal.He’s gobsmacked. I feel proud that I proved him wrong.I’ve been wanting this day for years. It’s not revenge – it’s to prove who I am now.In the past, I used to be ashamed of my learning disability because my dad used to put me down. I used to feel embarrassed, like a second-class citizen. But not now. My learning disability is a bit of me, but it’s not a big deal and it doesn’t define me. It hasn’t stopped me having a life.At 21, I moved into a council flat in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, with my younger brother. The flat was close to my mum who had split up from my dad by then. She’s an amazing woman and we have a brilliant relationship. My brother supported me with things like reading letters and cooking. I love my brother but I wanted to cook, clean, dust, pay my bills – just like a normal person.The stepping stone to self-belief for me was when I got my own place. I got help from KeyRing – an organisation which supports people to live independently.You wouldn’t know it now, but a long time ago I was like a doormat. I didn’t have any qualifications when I left school (they don’t teach you much at special school), but I got a job as a trainee hotel porter and then moved on to housekeeping work and handyman jobs at the hotel. I enjoyed it because I was meeting new people and earning my own wage. I felt like a proper adult.My next job in a warehouse was sweeping up, packing and taking boxes to the skip. The boss didn’t trust me to do anything else. I started to get very bored.The other blokes used to abuse me physically and mentally because of my disability. They used to call me – and I hate these words – “retard” and “spacca” (as in ‘spastic’). They’d mock me because I used to stutter quite badly. They’d imitate me talking because of my speech impediment. I hated that job because for the next five years I was bullied, ridiculed and abused. The first time someone said something to me I was on the second floor of the warehouse, pulling boxes off shelves. I heard “retard” from behind me, someone calling out. I said “what?”, like I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Another time, someone lobbed a shoe at me and it got me in the head. I wanted to punch them, but I didn’t want to lose my job. They used to throw boxes at me too. I asked them why and they said, “We were joking.” I told them I didn’t find it funny.Every time I reported the abuse, I thought, what’s the point? I’d get called “grass”. I used to get very down and I felt very small, like I was less of a human being. I was a dad by then and I needed that £100 a week, so I had to stick it out because of my kids and partner at the time, and I wanted to be independent. I used to cry when I got home, but I’d think at least it was another day done.It was a really dark time. I was dying inside.Eventually I heard about a job going at the human rights charity CHANGE. I got an interview through the support charity that had got me the warehouse job. There were two people with learning disabilities on the panel, which made me feel equal and respected. I told them I had experience of life as a father with a learning disability and I was passionate about our rights.Before this job I’d never been further than South Yorkshire. Now as an international project worker with CHANGE, I travel all over the world to to train professionals to work better with children and young people with learning disabilities and to support the young people to speak up for themselves. This builds my confidence. I eventually lost my stutter. In the past I didn’t use the telephone because I thought people wouldn’t understand me, but I do now.I’ve also co-authored a book called Leaving Institutions, Voices for Change, that aims to help social workers involved in moving people out of long-term residential care.I think that without work I’d be very timid, isolated and lonely, and I wouldn’t have a voice. The best thing about my job is that it’s helped me challenge people in a way that’s professional.I can’t read or write very well, but you can get around that. Apps on computers mean I can dictate my emails. I get government funding for disabled people in work it’s called Access to Work and it pays for someone to help with paperwork two mornings a week.Of course, being a father and grandfather is an achievement. I’ve got two grown-up children in their 20s and a 15-year-old daughter, who lives with my former partner in Sheffield. My daughter says, “My dad works to make things better for people with learning disabilities.” I listen to people a lot and they trust me. At work my nickname’s Father Shaun.When I became a dad, the first thing I got asked at the warehouse was, “Has the baby got a learning disability?” They asked this even before they asked if we’d had a boy or a girl. None of my kids have disabilities, but if they did, it wouldn’t be a big deal. It’s just a label people put on you.I wish the older Shaun could go back to the younger Shaun and tell him what I’ve done. I’m not sure the younger Shaun would believe him.Other people with learning disabilities can achieve great things too. I came from nowhere with no power and no self-respect. I didn’t know about my human rights. My message is this: Never stop believing in yourself don’t let other people tell you that you can’t do it. If you’ve got something you want to do, then do do it. I think before you try and inspire others to believe in themselves, you have to believe in yourself. And don’t take any crap.• This is an edited extract of Shaun Webster’s story, Father Shaun, from Made Possible: Stories of success by people with learning disabilities – in their own words, edited by Saba Salman.

I don’t see racism at all in the NFL, I don’t see discrimination in the NFL. We all live together, joined as one, for one common goal, and we all intermingle and mix tremendously.

Carson’s teammate Quandre Diggs tweeted: “Is he blind??”Others on social media pointed to the fact that Colin Kaepernick has been exiled from the league for protesting against the racial injustice and police brutality that led to the death of Floyd last week. Meanwhile, the NFL is struggling to persuade teams to recruit minority coaches in a league in which the majority of players are black. There were eight NFL head coaches from a minority background in 2018, now there are four.On Tuesday, Fangio spoke about his own sadness and anger at the death of Floyd and said he encouraged his players to protest over the killing. “It’s a societal issue that we all have to join in to correct,” Fangio said.Elsewhere, Kaepernick’s close friend and former teammate, Eric Reid, criticized the San Francisco 49ers for participating in the Blackout Tuesday movement. “I think you meant Blackball Tuesday … I digress,” Reid said.The 49ers are the last team Kaepernick played for.

It was mid-March – the last days before Europe went into lockdown. I went to Slovenia’s\u0026nbspmost\u0026nbspfamous cave system to witness something that might now, in the shadow of pandemic and imploding economies, seem frivolous: a sneak peek at what was to be the first public display of recently hatched olms:\u0026nbspblind, worm-like amphibians that are one of nature’s most remarkable underground\u0026nbspcreatures.\u0026nbspBut barely had the\u0026nbspyoung olms\u0026nbspsettled into their new vivarium than Postojna Cave closed to visitors for the longest time in its 200-year history.\u0026nbspPostojna’s 24km cave system – 50km south of the capital Ljubljana, and just a 40-minute drive from Trieste in Italy – is one of Europe’s most-visited subterranean attractions. In pre-Covid-19\u0026nbspyears nearly a million tourists took the red-and-yellow train through its caverns into\u0026nbspa floodlit, cathedral-size\u0026nbspchamber – and\u0026nbspPostojna’s\u0026nbspmost-photographed rock formation, the five-metre-tall “Brilliant” stalagmite.\u0026nbspThey would file past a tank of adult olms, with its dim red lighting to protect their photosensitive skinsand visit the world’s only underground post office, complete with its own stamp and postmark.Slovenia has fared better than many of its European neighbours through the\u0026nbspCovid-19 crisis\u0026nbsp- with 1,473 cases and 109 deaths to date. Bars and restaurants reopened on 5 May\u0026nbspand on Wednesday the lights will go up again in Postojna Cave. Public health measures include 1.5-metre social distancing, mandatory masks, the sanitising of equipment in between tours, and a limit of 60 people per train (instead of the usual 116). On 11 June, the young olms – or, as everyone in the cave calls them, the “baby dragons” – will at last go on display.If olms are dragons, Primož\u0026nbspGnezda, a blond biologist with a beatific smile and complexion untroubled by the sun of the over-world, is their handler. As Postojna’s resident biologist, he spends his days in the cave, observing creatures that remain stubbornly mysterious, even to scientists who dedicate careers to their study.Local legend had it that the olm (also known as the proteus or human fish) was the offspring of cave-dwelling dragons – it’s as good a way as any of explaining the strange, pink wrigglers that were washed out of the caves after heavy rain. The truth is hardly less extraordinary. Olms are neotenous, meaning they retain juvenile characteristics for all of their 100-year lifes – they never lose the pink external gills that look like sea anemone tentacles. At 30cm long, adult olms are the world’s largest subterranean animals these aquatic salamanders are also blind, sensing light and vibration through their skin and sensory pits on their heads. Their hearts beat just twice a minute, and they can go more than a decade without food.A display of adult olms has been\u0026nbsppart of Postojna’s offering since the\u0026nbspearly 19th century (they are mentioned in a 1868 Baedeker Guide), but the creature considered by some to be Slovenia’s national animal had never bred in captivity in the country before (the French, to Slovenian\u0026nbspchagrin, managed it in the 1950s). Nor had olms ever been seen breeding in the wild. So when, in 2016, a translucent spherical olm egg appeared on the glass of Postojna’s main vivarium, Gnezda and his colleagues couldn’t believe their luck. More eggs appeared. The nation held its breath for an agonising 120 days before 22 babies hatched in the underground laboratory.The babies have already yielded insights into olm behaviour. Researchers knew the animals could regrow lost limbs, but when one of the young tore off a sibling’s leg, they were able to study the regeneration process up close. Yet much about the amphibians remains mysterious. We have no idea how many olms live in the wild, nor even how many species there are, says Lilijana Mali, an amphibians expert at Ljubljana University. Her team think there are probably nine types, scattered throughout the Adriatic limestone karst. They do know, though, that the amphibians are sensitive to pollution as well as light, which makes Postojna’s breeding success all the more vital.Like skiing for the Norwegians or surfing for Hawaiians, caving is a national pastime in Slovenia. The limestone bedrock of this country of 2 million people is peppered with more than 13,000 caves. To experience the realm of the wild olms, I pulled on overalls, helmet and wellies and left behind the vivarium and the tourist train. Caver and guide Roman Bogataj, who studies astrophysics in his spare time, was to be my guide, and I warned him that I suffer from mild claustrophobia. “Just think of it as a walk with nice scenery,” he said, with a stroke of his beard.We followed an easy path along a thundering subterranean river, then turned off into a side chamber known as the Colourful Passage. Translucent curtain stalactites hung from the ceiling and the floor was adorned with cave pearls, glinting stalagmites and jumbled red rocks. Then Roman nonchalantly invited me to crawl through an oval opening in the rock face, a mere olm’s-length high. “I can fit, so for you it’s no problem,” he smiled, patting his modest belly.\u0026nbspI peered into the hole and felt darts of adrenalin shoot down my legs, but with Roman’s reassurance, and against every instinct, I found myself squirming into the crevice. The rock squeezed my chest from below and above, narrowing to a point where I had to angle my helmeted head to one side to fit through. I belly-wriggled and kicked until I was alone in a chamber that was the stillest place I’ve ever been.Roman joined me and we clicked off our headtorches. For a few clockless minutes we experienced the world the baby dragons know: a place of silence and deep, smothering darkness, to which my thoughts have often turned in the long lockdown months since. When Roman switched on his torch I found myself like the olm, flinching from the light and in no hurry to return to the bright, chaotic world above.\u0026nbsp• The trip was provided by Postojna Cave, which is open daily 9am-7pm from 3 June (summer hours), with baby olms in their new vivarium from 11 June. Tours: adult €25.80, 5-16 years €15.50• This article was amended on 3 June to say the vivarium will be on view from 11 June, not 8 June as originally stated"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a160cd1794565be08422bfb57f10d08a7976dee/0_140_4233_2540/master/4233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28c8e9ff6840f85faf22f54c889d9418","title":"its an exciting beginning venice opens to tourists","story":"As Italy eases restrictions further, we report from Venice, where hotels and restaurants are eager to welcome back overseas visitors but some fear a return to mass tourism‘We leapt at the chance of visiting Venice. The idea of seeing it with hardly any people was too good an opportunity to miss.” Marco Schmandt and Nina Goretzko are standing outside Venice’s railway station, checking Google Maps for directions to their B\u0026ampB.For the past two weeks, only those from the surrounding Veneto region have been able to go to Venice, but from today people from all over the country are free to travel again, and the country’s international borders are open, with no quarantine restrictions. Venice’s Marco Polo airport is functioning, with Air France-KLM flights to Paris and Amsterdam, as well as onward international connections. More airlines are looking at recommencing flights from July, though foreign tourists are unlikely to arrive until the opening of Schengen frontiers is confirmed, which could be as early as 15 June.Marianna Serandrei is the fourth generation running Hotel Saturnia \u0026amp International, in a 15th-century palazzo five minutes’ walk from Saint Mark’s. “We reopened on 30 May and immediately had guests from Vicenza, Padua and Treviso. Today is the big day though – the\u0026nbspopening\u0026nbspof the border – and we have 10 arrivals. This may not sound much but it is an exciting beginning, even if we have 87 rooms. We are expecting guests from China and Eastern Europe who booked a few weeks ago, though we will not know where they have flown\u0026nbspfrom until they check in. With flights arriving today from Amsterdam and Rome, it is likely they will have had international connections. And next week we are delighted that\u0026nbspa couple of Americans have made a new booking but, again, we will only\u0026nbspfind out where exactly they’ve come from when they arrive … as we hope they will.”As of 1 June,\u0026nbspVenetians are no longer required to wear masks outside, which makes walking around feel more normal, though it pays to have one in your pocket as they are mandatory in shops or on a vaporetto. People are supposed to stay one metre apart, and as throughout the lockdown, there will be a visible police presence ready to hand out fines, especially when late-night drinking at gets out of hand at hotspots such as Fondamenta dei Ormesini, Campo Santa Margherita and Campo Bella Vienna by the Rialto.Venice started gradually reopening early, from 14 May, and residents already see the greatest difference at weekends. Walking around Venice on weekdays is like stepping back in time, with most streets and squares deserted, vaporetti empty apart from rush hour, and the Rialto market, which stayed open throughout, no longer packed with slow-moving tour groups. The still waters of canals are disturbed only by slender wooden boats, rowed by locals standing up in classic gondolier style, rather than the moto ondoso waves made by speeding water taxis. How long it will stay like this is the big question, and no one can agree on the answer.\u0026nbspEverywhere I walk, bars and osterie are busy, with staff in masks and gloves, and customers using smartphones to scan barcodes on menus. While the flagship Architecture Biennale has been postponed till 2021, the Venice Film Festival is going ahead from 2-12 September, and the weekend of 18 July will see the traditional Festa della Redentore firework display. From 15 June, cinemas and theatres reopen, and the Fenice opera house is planning a spectacular musical installation, whose details are still secret. And the long sandy beaches of the Lido are already open, with spaced sun loungers awaiting a summer invasion. The many campsites along this Adriaticcoast are already gearing up for a short but hectic summer season.Two-star Hotel Guerrini near the railway stationis expecting its first guests on 11 June. “We already have two reservations for that day, so we will be open, as we have been for over 80 years,” says owner Adriano Mazzo. “Everything will be slow at first, to be sure, but we have had several inquiries from foreign travellers about availability and reservations in November and December.”Luxury hotels are not all rushing to reopen, but Giampaolo Ottazzi, director of the iconic Cipriani, tells me: “We will be greeting guests again from 19 June and I hope that flights arriving again at Italian airports will permit the return of our international clientele alongside Italian guests. In terms of reservation enquiries, the US market is especially interested from August onwards, whereas UK travellers are waiting to learn how and when they will be able to come here again.”He says the Cipriani is already getting enquires from countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria and France as well as places in the Middle East. “I believe there really is a strong desire to travel again, especially with family”Not everyone here is welcoming back tourists with open arms. Environmental scientist Jane da Mosto is co-founder and director of the NGO We Are Here Venice, and is also active in the movement against cruise ships. She says: “We have a genuine opportunity today to change the future of Venice, and when the free movement of people is restored, we have to stop having such a tourism-dominated economy. There is a lot of idealist talk going around, but government is not putting forward any serious, coherent policies or proposals at this unique moment. We can seize the chance to reinvent Venice and capitalise on the human potential of the residents of what is still a living city. To ‘save Venice’ you have to save the residents first, give them affordable places to live and alternative work opportunities.”Her views are echoed by Cesare Benelli of fine-dining restaurant Al Covo . “This is the moment we must grab to definitively change Venice, limit the number of visitors and stop the daily mass invasion of people who contribute nothing and disrespect our special city,” he says. “Yes, this may mean restaurants serving preheated pastas and microwaved pizzas have to close, along with gift shops peddling poor-quality carnival masks, plastic gondolas and fake Murano glass. Well so be it.”As I walk through quiet backstreets towards Saint Mark’s Square, gondolier Mauro Tochi is patiently waiting for customers. “We were asked to come back on duty from 1 June, ready to welcome visitors again,” he says, “but I don’t expect any work for the first few weeks, till flights really start working again in July. If there is one place in the world people will want to come back to when they can travel again I honestly believe it will be Venice. Nothing compares to our city. But I hope also that this new generation of tourists that come here will respect the city more. Who knows, maybe they will start listening to what I tell them of the history of the Serenissima as we glide down the canals, rather than snapping selfies and talking on their phones.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f3c00933510c9dfb1467ff880f9196c5e637728/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9b0b4ed14a7996ae86e69bfa371c0ee","title":"steve king loses re election iowa","story":"Randy Feenstra unseats nine-term conservative, who was repeatedly reprimanded by party leaders for interactions with white nationalistsThe controversial Iowa Republican congressman Steve King has been ousted in Tuesday’s primary, losing his re-election race to the state senator Randy Feenstra.King had faced the re-election fight of his life. The nine-term conservative congressman, who was repeatedly reprimanded by leaders in his own party for racist rhetoric and interactions with white nationalists, found himself in a nightmare situation for an incumbent congressman.He had been stripped of his committee assignments, abandoned by more mainstream\u0026nbspRepublicans\u0026nbspand chastised by party leadership. He had even lost support from prominent conservatives in Iowa.Feenstra declared victory on Tuesday evening, promising he’d deliver “results for the families, farmers and communities of Iowa”.King on Tuesday faced four Republican primary challengers, including Feenstra. Several of King’s former supporters had thrown their weight behind Feenstra.For years, King was a source of headaches for Republican party leadership.He has tied immigrant children to being drug mules, questioned whether minorities have contributed anything valuable to western civilization and displayed a Confederate flag on his desk. He has wondered why it is offensive to be called a white nationalist. He has also associated with far-right figures including the Dutch politician Geert Wilders, and once argued to a far-right Austrian publication that elites were trying to reduce the white population and increase minorities.Even the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, suggested that King seek other careers.In November, Feenstra will face his Democratic opponent, who is hardly a shoo-in. In the last five presidential elections, Iowa’s fourth congressional district has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee only once – in 2008 for Barack Obama.Iowa’s vote was held alongside a host of other primary contests on Tuesday that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest.Joe Biden, the de-facto Democratic presidential candidate, was on the cusp of formally securing the nomination after winning hundreds more delegates in Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota.Other victories of the night included Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader – who won an easy nomination in the Democratic primary in Maryland’s fifth district, a seat he has held for 40 years –\u0026nbspand Yvette Herrell,\u0026nbspwho won the Republican primary in New Mexico’s second district."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c3ca12e81f976ff6bf2cb6629480ca07be19ccd/0_570_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cffdee7ddc46f79fa02ba6568073b463","title":"share your coronavirus contact tracing experiences with us","story":"Whether you are a contact tracer or have taken part in the scheme, we would like to hear from youOn Thursday 25,000 new contact tracers started speaking to those with coronavirus and tracing people they have come into close contact with over the past two weeks.

Further details about the rules will be set out on Wednesday by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who has said avoiding a second wave of infections “will always be our top priority” and insisted the restrictions “are informed by the science, backed by the public and will keep us all safe”.\u0026nbspThere is widespread concern that the imposition of a 14-day quarantine will cause further damage to the travel and tourism sectors, which have been badly hit by a collapse in demand.On Wednesday the London Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 2,000 businesses in the capital, said a blanket quarantine for all international arrivals sent out a message that the UK is closed for business.\u0026nbspIn a letter to ministers, its chief executive, Paul Scully, proposed a “risk-based approach” involving country-by-country assessments as well as travel corridors with other nations. He said the government’s roadmap to restarting the economy should “recognise that arrivals from some countries with much lower transmission levels than the UK and low incidence of the disease would not increase our risk, provided they adopted our social distancing protocols on arrival.”Boris Johnson’s official spokesman confirmed on Tuesday that the government was still looking at the prospect of air bridges between the UK and other countries, creating specific exemptions from the quarantine rules.EasyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have announced plans to increase their operations next month, despite the Foreign Office advising against non-essential foreign travel.Public health experts have questioned the logistics of the UK forging travel arrangements with countries that have much lower levels of infection. The junior health minister Edward Argar said he hoped people would be able to go on holiday “at some point this year” but a quarantine policy was necessary to minimise the risk of the virus being “reimported” from other nations.Pressed on Today to name a European country with a higher infection rate than the UK, Argar repeatedly sidestepped the question, saying he did not want to pre-empt Patel’s statement to parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/252be9290a905b64ea94097b10aba896e598eb2e/0_307_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4077b3364c0db4753b45249af67c7265","title":"beijing draws up plans to outlaw criticism of traditional chinese medicine","story":"Draft legislation could lead to criminal prosecution for smearing medicinal approach backed by Xi JinpingAuthorities in Beijing are drafting legislation to outlaw criticism of traditional medicine in the Chinese capital.A notice published by health authorities called for public submissions on the draft, which would ban any inidual or organisation from making false or exaggerated claims about traditional Chinese medicine, or using it for illegitimate interests or to damage public interest.It would potentially lead to the criminal prosecution of people who criticise traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or “cause trouble or disturb public order” by breaching the law.The move comes amid a broader campaign by China to promote TCM at home and abroad. In March state media said TCM therapies had been playing a “critical role” in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19, and some were sent to other nations as part of China’s international aid.China’s president Xi Jinping is a fervent supporter of TCM as a pillar of industry, and its potential to grow and develop.The draft and explanatory notes for the move in Beijing did not give details on what would constitute a smear against TCM. Submissions for public feedback are open until 28 June.The medical approach has evolved over thousands of years, and encompasses a broad range of treatments, including acupuncture, eating habits, and a range of drugs.According to a white paper by China’s state council published four years ago, the total value of the nation’s TCM industry was expected to reach $420bn by the end of this year.TCM has been the subject of several controversies, including the use of endangered animals by some practitioners.Last month the  reported the continued use of endangered animal parts, including from pangolins, tigers, leopards and rhinos, was endangering the reputation of the practice and industry.In November, European doctors called for tighter regulation after the World Health Organization (WHO) added a chapter on TCM to the International Classification of Diseases, which lists globally available medical treatments and influences government health budgets. The WHO said the addition was not an endorsement, but European scientists expressed concern it would be used for promotion of TCM.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/771ef432703bea0f4c935ec1c95a4992626a3185/967_115_5416_3249/master/5416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce87f05a2733fdca04e429dca9618ea2","title":"china accuses uk of gross interference over hong kong citizenship offer","story":"‘Serious representations’ made after worries offer could trigger brain drain from regionChina’s foreign ministry has accused Britain of “gross interference” in the country’s affairs after Boris Johnson said he would offer millions of Hong Kong residents a path to UK citizenship if Beijing pushed ahead with a controversial security law for the city.The ministry’s spokesman\u0026nbspZhao Lijian\u0026nbsptold Britain to “step back … otherwise there will be consequences” and said China had made “serious representations” to London over its\u0026nbspoffer to holders of British national (overseas) passports.Although pro-democracy politicians and protesters in Hong Kong welcomed Britain’s offer, most said they would prefer international efforts to focus also on protection for the city – in the form perhaps of sanctions against China or officials in Beijing – and not just on providing sanctuary for those who want to flee.“I think it’s a shame in a way that they only offer us an exit, and do not offer to stand by us in our fight for Hong Kong,” said Lee Cheuk Yan, a veteran activist who was arrested in a widely condemned crackdown by Hong Kong authorities this year.There are also concerns that the offer excludes the city’s youth, who have been at the forefront of the year-long protest movement, because the BNO passports are issued only to people born before the 1997 end of British colonial rule.“We welcome the British giving BNO holders the right of abode. But young people born after British left are not BNO holders. They’re our hope and should be given the priority over old people like me who are near the end of their lives,” said Jimmy Lai, a media tycoon and outspoken critic of Beijing who was arrested this year.Britain’s position is based on the joint declaration between the two countries, which paved the way for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 and promised the city 50 years of autonomy from that date, with its rights and freedoms protected.The agreement was registered with the UN, and the UK considers it a binding international treaty Beijing now argues that as soon as the handover was complete, it effectively became void.“There is no single word or clause in the Sino-British joint declaration that entitles the UK to any responsibility for Hong Kong after its return,” Zhao said on Wednesday at a regular press briefing.“The UK has no sovereignty, governance or supervision over Hong Kong … Therefore, the UK has no right to lecture or interfere in China’s internal affairs under the pretence of the joint declaration.”Johnson said Britain would activate its offer only if Beijing “pushes ahead” with the law. China’s rubber-stamp parliament has passed the law but details of how it will be implemented in Hong Kong have not yet been spelled out.About 350,000 people hold British national (overseas) passports, and another 2.5 million people could become eligible for one under Britain’s offer. There is still a lot of ambiguity about what the “path to citizenship” proposed by Johnson would look like and who exactly might be eligible.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, accused foreign critics of “blatant double standards”, claiming every country had the right to pass national security laws.“Why should they object, resist or even condemn and take sanctions against Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China for taking similar actions to protect (themselves),” she told reporters.For now though, many in her own city do not believe those assurances. Elaine Leong, at 42 does not want to leave Hong Kong but plans to apply for a British national (overseas) passport for the first time, “just in case”.“It is more secure to have a foreign passport in our hands in case anything drastic happens.\u0026nbspIt’s not for us, but for our child’s future,” she said.“But having said that, we don’t have any roots in Britain, we don’t know anyone.\u0026nbspHow easy is it to find a job when the economy in the UK isn’t good?

It was also behind a decision by the WHO and research institutes around the world to halt trials of the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine.Two of the world’s leading medical journals – the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine – published studies based on Surgisphere data. The studies were co-authored by the firm’s chief executive, Sapan Desai.Late on Tuesday, after being approached by the , the Lancet released an “expression of concern” about its published study. The New England Journal of Medicine has also issued a similar notice.An independent audit of the provenance and validity of the data has now been commissioned by the authors not affiliated with Surgisphere because of “concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the database”.Questions surrounding Surgisphere have been growing in the medical community for the past few weeks.On 22 May the Lancet published a blockbuster peer-reviewed study which found the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which has been promoted by Donald Trump, was associated with a higher mortality rate in Covid-19 patients and increased heart problems.Trump, much to the dismay of the scientific community, had publicly touted hydroxychloroquine as a “wonder drug” despite no evidence of its efficacy for treating Covid-19.The Lancet study, which listed Desai as one of the co-authors,\u0026nbspclaimed to have analysed Surgisphere data collected from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19, admitted to 1,200 hospitals around the world, who received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with antibiotics.The negative findings made global news and prompted the WHO to halt the hydroxychloroquine arm of its global trials.But only days later  Australia revealed glaring errors in the Australian data included in the study. The study said researchers gained access to data through Surgisphere from five hospitals, recording 600 Australian Covid-19 patients and 73 Australian deaths as of 21 April.But data from Johns Hopkins University shows only 67 deaths from Covid-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April.\u0026nbspDesai said one Asian hospital had accidentally been included in the Australian data, leading to an overestimate of cases there. The Lancet published a small retraction related to the Australian findings after the ’s story, its only amendment to the study so far. has since contacted five hospitals in Melbourne and two in Sydney, whose cooperation would have been essential for the Australian patient numbers in the database to be reached. All denied any role in such a database, and said they had never heard of Surgisphere. Desai did not respond to requests to comment on their statements. Another study using the Surgisphere database, again co-authored by Desai, found the anti-parasite drug ivermectin reduced death rates in severely ill Covid-19 patients. It was published online in the Social Science Research Network e-library, before peer-review or publication in a medical journal, and prompted the Peruvian government to add ivermectin to its national Covid-19 therapeutic guidelines.The New England Journal of Medicine  also published a peer-reviewed Desai study based on Surgisphere data, which included data from Covid-19 patients from 169 hospitals in 11 countries in Asia, Europe and North America. It found common heart medications known as angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers were not associated with a higher risk of harm in Covid-19 patients.On Wednesday, the NEJM and the Lancet published an expression of concern about the hydroxychloroquine study, which listed respected vascular surgeon Mandeep Mehra as the lead author and Desai as co-author.Lancet editor Richard Horton told the : “Given the questions raised about the reliability of the data gathered by Surgisphere, we have today issued an Expression of Concern, pending further investigation.“An independent data audit is currently underway and we trust that this review, which should be completed within the next week, will tell us more about the status of the findings reported in the paper by Mandeep Mehra and colleagues.”One of the questions that has most baffled the scientific community is how Surgisphere, established by Desai in 2008 as a medical education company that published textbooks, became the owner of a powerful international database. That database, despite only being announced by Surgisphere recently, boasts access to data from 96,000 patients in 1,200 hospitals around the world.When contacted by the , Desai said his company employed just 11 people. The employees listed on LinkedIn were recorded on the site as having joined Surgisphere only two months ago. Several did not appear to have a scientific or statistical background, but mention expertise in strategy, copywriting, leadership and acquisition. Dr James Todaro, who runs MedicineUncensored, a website that publishes the results of hydroxychloroquine studies, said: “Surgisphere came out of nowhere to conduct perhaps the most influential global study in this pandemic in the matter of a few weeks.Desai told the : “Surgisphere has been in business since 2008. Our healthcare data analytics services started about the same time and have continued to grow since that time. We use a great deal of artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate this process as much as possible, which is the only way a task like this is even possible.” It is not clear from the methodology in the studies that used Surgisphere data, or from the Surgisphere website itself, how the company was able to put in place data-sharing agreements from so many hospitals worldwide, including those with limited technology, and to reconcile different languages and coding systems, all while staying within the regulatory, data-protection and ethical rules of each country.Desai said Surgisphere and its QuartzClinical content management system was part of a research collaboration initiated “several years ago”, though he did not specify when.“Surgisphere serves as a data aggregator and performs data analysis on this data,” he said. “We are not responsible for the source data, thus the labor intensive task required for exporting the data from an Electronic Health Records, converting it into the format required by our data dictionary, and fully deidentifying the data is done by the healthcare partner.”This appears to contradict the claim on the QuartzClinical website that it does all the work, and “successfully integrates your electronic health record, financial system, supply chain, and quality programs into one platform”. Desai did not explain this apparent contradiction when the  put it to him.Desai said the way Surgisphere obtained data was “always done in compliance with local laws and regulations. We never receive any protected health information or inidually identifiable information.”Peter Ellis, the chief data scientist of Nous Group, an international management consultancy that does data integration projects for government departments, expressed concern that Surgisphere database was “almost certainly a scam”.“It is not something that any hospital could realistically do,” he said. “De-identifying is not just a matter of knocking off the patients’ names, it is a big and difficult process. I doubt hospitals even have capability to do it appropriately. It is the sort of thing national statistics agencies have whole teams working on, for years.”None of the information from Desai’s database has yet been made public, including the names of any of the hospitals, despite the Lancet being among the many signatories\u0026nbspto a statement on data-sharing for Covid-19 studies. The Lancet study is now disputed by 120 doctors.When the  put a detailed list of concerns to Desai about the database, the study findings and his background, he responded: “There continues to be a fundamental misunderstanding about what our system is and how it works”.“There are also a number of inaccuracies and unrelated connections that you are trying to make with a clear bias toward attempting to discredit who we are and what we do,” he said. “We do not agree with your premise or the nature of what you have put together, and I am sad to see that what should have been a scientific discussion has been denigrated into this sort of discussion.”An examination of Desai’s background found that the vascular surgeon has been named in three medical malpractice suits in the US, two of them filed in November 2019. In one case, a lawsuit filed by a patient, Joseph Vitagliano, accused Desai and Northwest Community Hospital in Illinois, where he worked until recently, of being “careless and negligent”, leading to permanent damage following surgery.\u0026nbspNorthwest Community Hospital confirmed that Desai had been employed there since June 2016 but had voluntarily resigned on 10 February 2020 “for personal reasons”.“Dr Desai’s clinical privileges with NCH were not suspended, revoked or otherwise limited by NCH,” a spokeswoman said. The hospital declined to comment on the malpractice suits. Desai said in the interview with the Scientist that he deemed any lawsuit against him to be “unfounded”.Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the institution affiliated with the hydroxychloroquine study and its lead author, Mandeep Mehra, said in a statement: “Independent of Surgisphere, the remaining co-authors of the recent studies published in The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine have initiated independent reviews of the data used in both papers after learning of the concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the database”.\u0026nbspMehra said he had routinely underscored the importance and value of randomised, clinical trials and that such trials were necessary before any conclusions could be reached. “I eagerly await word from the independent audits, the results of which will inform any further action,” he said.Desai’s now-deleted Wikipedia page said he held a doctorate in law and a PhD in anatomy and cell biology, as well as his medical qualifications. A biography of Desai on a brochure for an international medical conference says he has held multiple physician leadership roles in clinical practice, and that he is “a certified lean six sigma master black belt”. It is not the first time Desai has launched projects with ambitious claims. In 2008, he launched a crowdfunding campaign on the website indiegogo promoting a “next generation human augmentation device” called Neurodynamics Flow, which he said “can help you achieve what you never thought was possible”.“With its sophisticated programming, optimal neural induction points, and tried and true results, Neurodynamics Flow allows you to rise to the peak of human evolution,” the description said. The device raised a few hundred dollars, and never eventuated.Ellis, the chief data scientist of Nous Group, said it was unclear why Desai made such bold claims about his products given how likely it was that the global research community would scrutinise them.“My first reaction is it was to draw attention to his firm, Ellis said. “But it seems really obvious that this would backfire.” Today Prof Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said: “I welcome the statement from the\u0026nbspLancet, which follows a similar statement by the\u0026nbspNEJM\u0026nbspregarding a study by the same group on cardiovascular drugs and COVID-19.\u0026nbsp“The very serious concerns being raised about the validity of the papers by Mehra et al need to be recognised and actioned urgently, and ought to bring about serious reflection on whether the quality of editorial and peer review during the pandemic has been adequate.\u0026nbspScientific publication must above all be rigorous and honest.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, these values are needed more than ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7e08cb74cab52ee3a9e2e76e4d2c8883e9112ec/0_668_3224_1933/master/3224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6322633c7be9e95617a7a59795d7c383","title":"facebook survey finds 1 of britons reporting coronavirus symptoms","story":"Figures show slow but steady reduction in number of people reporting Covid symptoms in MayThe findings are part of Facebook’s Covid-19 symptom survey, a global effort on the part of the company to use its enormous user base to track the spread of the virus.Since its launch in April, around 120,000 people in the UK have taken part in the survey, registering the presence or absence of Covid-19 symptoms by following a prompt from the social network. Globally, there have been more than 10m responses, the company said.The survey is being run in collaboration with statisticians at the University of Maryland, who worked with Facebook’s Data for Good team to build a publicly available map and dashboard\u0026nbspvisualising the international results.“By fielding questions that are comparable globally the UK is benefiting from additional data that will be even more valuable going forward as we jointly examine the conditions for reopening in different countries under different scenarios,” said Dr Frauke Kreuter, the director of the university’s joint programme in survey methodology.The symptom survey differs from a number of others in its selection process. Many large-scale symptom surveys require users to opt-in to the survey, by proactively downloading an app or visiting a website. That risks biasing the results, if certain demographics are more likely to volunteer themselves, or if people proactively join the survey when they begin experiencing symptoms.“Survey methodologists and statisticians at UMD value particularly the fact that people cannot self-select into the respondent pool, Kreuter said. “Unlike surveys done via specific apps or websites designed to collect symptom data, the recruitment through the Facebook platform allows us to reach everyone who is using Facebook, and then randomly select within those users.”In this, Facebook’s data is similar to that gathered by\u0026nbspGoogle\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspApple through their mapping programmes, released much earlier in the Covid crisis. All three companies have seen mobility rise significantly from the lockdown lows, with some countries, including the US and Germany, returning to normality, as measured by requests for directions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14eafbf2142e906b4b2c0fa633e35e1cb64df762/222_0_1325_796/master/1325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5e83114ee22950d0fd8e697666995e1","title":"irish mep luke ming flanagan caught with no trousers in eu debate","story":"Flanagan jokes about having legs insured after mistakenly putting iPad in portrait mode for callGazing into the camera while you sit on a bed with no trousers on might, in another context, arouse certain expectations.But Luke “Ming” Flanagan, an Irish MEP, was unaware his bottom half was showing as he beamed in from home to discuss agriculture policy on the European parliament’s official live broadcast.Flanagan wore a dark dress shirt for his contribution on European Union farming subsidies but the camera angle turned his two-minute address into a cautionary tale about pandemic-era remote working.“Thank you very much, Commissioner Hahn,” Flanagan began, after Johannes Hahn, the commissioner for budget and administration, gave him the floor. “Obviously at all times we should be trying to get the maximum bang for our buck.”Flanagan discussed CAP subsidies and the pace of convergence but viewers may not have been focusing on his words.

These assessments will take place online.The second semester will run from February 1st to Friday, 23rd April 2021.PodsTrinity is the latest university to announce that it is combining online lecture with face-to-face tuition, where possible.In addition, some are planning that students on campus will work together in “pods” or small groups to minimise physical mixing.The capacity of larger lecture theatres in many colleges cases will have to be reduced by up to 90 per cent in order to comply with 2m social-distancing requirements.University College Dublin, whose academic year is due to begin on September 21st, said it is planning to live-stream larger lectures, which will be physically attended by a much-reduced number of students.The university’s president, Prof Andrew Deeks, said core modules would have elements delivered in person.Technological University Dublin, president Prof David Fitzpatrick told students recently that restrictions on numbers in lectures will have a significant impact on timetabling and the mode of delivery, and also on how students experience university life.Dublin City University has also said it is planning a “hybrid” of online and face-to-face classes, with incoming first years due to begin two week earlier than other students.Maynooth University, NUI Galway, University College Cork and University of Limerick are also understood to be planned a “blended learning” approach when college reopens.In a message to students, UL president Dr Des Fitzgerald, said the university was examining the option of allowing groups of students and staff – perhaps 20 per cent – to rotate in periods of on-campus learning with periods of off-campus online delivery.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Taoiseach tells FG parliamentary party it may be next week before deal is finalisedUnions call for Government to lay out \u0026lsquoclear roadmap\u0026rsquo of just transition from peat productionUnthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debate"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutants"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins.Minister for Health Simon Harris has said he is concerned at the level of coronavirus cases that are being reported because of close contact with others.Ahead of the second planned easing of restrictions next Monday, he indicated that he wants to proceed with the phased plan rather than accelerating elements of it at this time.Mr Harris said “overall the metrics are positive in relation to the virus” with the number of people in intensive care with Covid-19 down from 99 on May 2nd to 36 or 37 on June 2nd and the number in hospital also down sharply. “But this idea that the virus has gone away, mission accomplished, is an enemy of the progress we have made,” he said.The Minister said the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) would consider all the issues and report to the Government.“One of the figures I will be interested in seeing tomorrow is the reproduction rate,” he said. “Once that R number stays below one it means we are suppressing the virus.“Once it goes over one we’re in a position again where we haven’t been in many weeks where the virus is growing. The figure that concerns me a little bit is the number of confirmed cases now that come from close contacts.”Close contactHe said recent figures show that more than 50 per cent of Covid-19 cases are a result of close contact with an infected person.“That basically means at the moment we are largely keeping a majority of the cases confined to close contacts but obviously as we start to move again our close contacts will grow in number. So we have to proceed with caution.” The Cabinet will meet twice this week - a routine meeting on Thursday in the Dublin Castle Conference Centre and a second on Friday in Government Buildings to decide whether to give the go ahead for the second phase of the coronavirus roadmap. The first meeting will see all members of the Cabinet gather in the same venue for the first time since the crisis began. Mr Harris said his “gut feeling” is that the next phase of the plan to reopen the country was at the right pace, with the next stage allowing people to travel up to 20km from home to visit other households while maintaining social distancing and the reopening of retail outlets. “My gut as of now is that if we can successfully get through phase one, and then successfully get through phase two, that would be a real confidence building block for all of us before we get into phase three and four, which is where we see a significant reopening of quite of a lot things,” he said. “There are some things in phase two that will result in a lot more movement. Once you get to 20km that’s actually a lot of movement.“There are also some measures in phase two that allow people to meet indoors with social distancing and there also measures that allow us to visit people cocooning or shielding. My sense is it is roughly speaking the right balance.”RationaleMr Harris said there was a public health rationale to the 20km limit.“There are parts of our country where we haven’t seen a Covid case in quite a number of days and some I believe in a couple of weeks. If we all start getting in our cars and travelling there, the virus will go there too.”The Minister also urged anyone who is considering organising a protest not to do so. “Now is a time where there is real human tragedy, social distancing is tough of all of us, and we have to stick with it,” he said. Mr Harris also said he wanted to remind people that if they are getting on public transport or shopping then they should wear face coverings as an additional hygiene measures.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Family has had no electricity for 15 years and has limited washing facilities, court toldEvent organisers say the rally has been set aside amid fears of Garda prosecutionMove is reversal of previous policy that did not require testing for people moved from hospitalsOnline lectures and on-campus tutorials for small groups may continue into 2021State alleges 96 offences were committed separately at family home in Co CorkWith travel limit due to rise to 20km, Minister cautions against bringing virus to less affected areasNorthern Executive and UK government deadlocked over who should pay \u0026pound100m costGeriatrician says half the patients he has seen lately have depression and anxietyFr John Kenny leads online Tourmakeady prayers following recovery of body from lakeFigure in international scout movement says Irish policies among best in world for decadesMove aims to pave way for planned \u0026euro15m renovation and extension of \u0026lsquoDead Zoo\u0026rsquoRapid serological tests could undermine public health response to crisis, report warnsHolohan says \u0026lsquowe\u0026rsquore in a good position\u0026rsquo for second phase of reopening to proceedTaoiseach tells FG parliamentary party it may be next week before deal is finalisedClimate expert urges Irish Water to fix decaying system to ease pressure on supplySince April, almost 200 online hearings have taken place as their style and form evolveStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4268752.1591111892!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"luke ming flanagan bares his bottom half to european parliament","story":" MEP Luke Ming Flanagan lived out a remote working nightmare by participating in a European Parliament committee meeting on agriculture in a state of undress.

File photograph: Pontus LundahlTT News AgencyAFP Sweden should have done more to combat the coronavirus and prevent a much higher national Covid-19 death rate than in neighbouring countries, the man behind the Public Health Agency’s pandemic strategy said on Wednesday.Nearly 4,500 Swedes have died in the outbreak, a higher mortality rate than in Denmark, Norway and Finland, and criticism has been growing over the government’s decision not to impose lockdown measures as strictly as elsewhere in Europe. Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency, said that in hindsight Sweden should have done more.“If we were to run into the same disease, knowing exactly what we know about it today, I think we would end up doing something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done,” Mr Tegnell told Swedish radio.“Yes, I think we could have done better in what we did in Sweden, clearly.”While most of Europe, including Norway, Denmark and Finland, closed schools, shops and businesses, bringing much of society to a halt, Sweden has relied more on voluntary measures, social distancing and common-sense hygiene advice to stem the outbreak.It shut care homes to visitors in late March, but around half of the deaths in the country have been among elderly people living in care facilities.Mr Tegnell said it was hard to know which measures taken elsewhere might have been the most effective in Sweden.“Maybe we will find this out now that people have started removing measures, one at a time,” he said. “And then maybe we will get some kind of information on what, in addition to what we did, we could do without adopting a total lockdown.”Earlier this week, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said the government would launch an enquiry into the handling of the pandemic. - ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"War and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role.

The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"have starved supermarkets behaved like schools","story":"A temperature check on the way in, and another one somewhere between the fish and cheese counter. Staff in full protective gear. Hand sanitisers and wipes on the corner of every aisle, and a system for shipping every packet of crisps off to the lab to make sure the packaging doesn’t have traces of the virus. Oh, and a pay rise for anyone coming into work, along with consultations on targets for gender and racial equality.If the supermarkets had imposed the same sort of restrictions on staying open through this epidemic as local authorities, Whitehall mandarins, and the teaching unions have imposed on schools we would all have starved by the middle of April.True, schools are not quite the same as grocery shops. Different rules and standards sometimes apply. And yet in truth, education is every bit as essential as food, and the logistical challenges are no more complex. Both teachers and the educational bureaucracy should learn some lessons in flexibility and adaptability from the private sector. At the risk of sounding like an especially platitudinous headmaster on speech day, challenges can be overcome, and difficulties surmounted, but only if everyone works together – and there sure isn’t much sign of that in the education system right now.Anyone who has been to a supermarket in the last month will have noticed how the big chains have adapted to a virus which, while infectious, is not completely deadly. One-way systems have been introduced, along with limits on the numbers of customers in the store at any one time, masks for staff, and cashless payment. It’s not just the supermarkets either: my local farm shop operated on a list system: tell them at the door what you wanted, and they packed a box for you. It is different. And it costs money. But the important point is this. Both the big chains and the local shops have adapted, and come up with something that works. The shelves are full. We can eat.The schools are very different. From Monday, primary schools were meant to finally reopen their doors to limited year groups. The aspiration was for all primary schools pupils to be able to spend a month in class before the summer holidays. But so far, things have been chaotic. Some areas have hardly any classes operating at all. In others, teachers are refusing to go back. Anxious parents and still more anxious five-year olds are confronted with a bewildering set of restrictions that threaten to rip out the soul of what a school should be.Many of the rules vary between the deranged and the slightly sinister. Do small children really need to be temperature-checked on the way in when there is so little evidence they carry Covid-19? Has whoever came up with the idea they shouldn’t be able to touch each other ever seen a bunch of five-year old boys in a playground? On what scientific grounds will class sizes be restricted? Is it really too dangerous for teachers to mark homework (and does it make a difference if the dog ate it? Does the library really need to be sanitised, or soft furnishings and toys removed? The list goes on and on.It would be easy to blame the teaching unions, and they are certainly using the crisis to push for a better deal – which usually means less work for more money – for their members. But the guidance from the Department for Education runs to dozens of pages. Schools are instructed to ensure “that toilets do not become too crowded by limiting the number of children or young people who use the toilet facilities at one time.”Local authorities are adding their own restrictions, and the more Left-wing they are, the more obstacles they are finding. No matter how hard inidual schools may be striving to make things work, behind the scenes, teams of bureaucrats and union officials are working overtime to make re-opening as hard as possible – while the parents and children suffer.The grocery chains, along with the rest of the private sector, have adapted to the crisis, and found a way to keep going. In truth, we over-regulate our schools, in the same way we over-regulate every nook and corner of the public sector. With some of the flexibility of the private sector, they could have re-opened a lot earlier. Sure, schools would be different, just as the supermarkets are different. But they would be open and operating – and that would be a big improvement on the chaos we are seeing right now.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bame covid coronavirus black ethnic minority background","story":"Despite only accounting for 13 per cent of the population in England and Wales, 44 per cent of all NHS doctors and 24 per cent of nurses are from a BAME background.Of at least 169 front-line health and social care workers in England and Wales known to have died because of Covid-19, 63.9 per cent were black or from an ethnic minority.Among them was Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a 53-year-old consultant who warned the Prime Minister about the need for more personal protective equipment (PPE) to support NHS staff during the pandemic.In a Facebook post in March, he warned Boris Johnson to “ensure urgently personal protective equipment for each and every NHS worker”.Manjeet Singh Riyat, who was the United Kingdom\u0027s first Sikh A\u0026ampE consultant, died on April 20. Mr Riyat was described as instrumental in building emergency services in Derbyshire over the last two decades, and was widely respected across the NHS.Bhai Amrik Singh, the Chair of the Sikh Federation (UK) said: “Manjeet had spent most of his life helping others as an A\u0026ampE consultant, from treating the sick to training junior doctors. Something very much in line with his faith principles of being a devout Sikh.”“This is a true tragedy, as another frontline NHS worker falls victim to this deadly virus. His death comes as a huge loss to the Derby \u0026amp Burton hospital, wider NHS family and to the whole Sikh community.”“The limited data available and images of those who have passed away suggests Covid-19 is disproportionally impacting on Sikhs and wider BAME communities.”Dr Chaand Nagpaul, British Medical Association (BMA) council chair, welcomed the review into BAME deaths, but stressed it must be informed by real-time data to understand why the virus appears to be disproportionately affecting BAME communities and healthcare workers. “This must include daily updates on ethnicity, circumstance and all protected characteristics of all patients in hospital as well as levels of illness in the community which is not currently recorded,” Dr Nagpaul said.“The government must send a directive to every hospital telling them to record the ethnicity of patients who are admitted and succumb to COVID immediately.”Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients are shown by new data to face a disproportionately high risk of death from coronavirus. Black men and women are more than four times more likely to die a coronavirus-related death than white people, new analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested.Black males in England and Wales are 4.2 times more likely, while black women are 4.3 times more likely to die after contracting the virus, after accounting for age. eople of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities also had an increased risk of death involving Covid-19.A study released on May 1 by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown that people of black African origin are three times more likely to die of coronavirus in the UK than white Britons, with deaths among those of Pakistani heritage 2.7 times as high.Of the 13,918 victims who tested positive in hospital up to April 17, 16.2 per cent of these were of BAME background. BAME communities make up around 13 per cent of the total population.Initial data on patients with confirmed Covid-19 from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) also suggested ethnic minorities are over-represented compared with the general population.Around 7.5 per cent of the population were Asian and 3.3 per cent black in the 2011 UK census.The first 10 doctors named as having died from Covid-19 in the UK were from BAME communities - a figure that the Labour Party described as deeply disturbing.Some analysts have suggested that the burden of coronavirus falls on poorer communities, in which BAME people are over-represented.Marsha de Cordova, the shadow equalities secretary, called for the Government to urgently investigate why BAME communities are more vulnerable to this virus.Her call came after the chairman of the BMA, Dr Nagpaul, said it could not be random that the first 10 doctors named as having died from the virus were all from BAME communities.Those doctors have ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa. However, the BMA chair said that even allowing for the over-representation of BAME staff in the NHS the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was “extremely disturbing and worrying”.England\u0027s Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was critical to find out which groups are most at risk. He said it remains unclear why some ethnic groups appear to be more vulnerable. I\u0027ve had discussions with scientists about this in terms of trying to tease this apart today, he said.It is not just in the UK that the number of BAME people affected by coronavirus has caused alarm.In the United States there has been growing concern over the rising number of coronavirus deaths among African-American communities. The latest data suggests that people who are black or hiic in the US are twice as likely to die from Covid-19.In states reporting fatalities by race, 34 per cent of American victims were black, according to research from John Hopkins University, and black Americans also represent 33 per cent of coronavirus hospital admissions.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up try size 75 shoes","story":"After all those one-hour-a-day walks outside, how are your shoes feeling?Fancy a new pair as a treat when the stores reopen?

I stand with them.There have been so many state sponsored acts of murder of black people, in Minnesota and across the country.When the news of George Floyd started to break I woke up to lots of friends checking in with me. Before his name was released the word had gotten out that police had killed an unarmed black man in the south side of Minneapolis. That\u0027s where I work, and where I live. It\u0027s where I raise my 15-year-old son.Throughout the day we started to get more information. Then they released his name, then the fact the white officer had been kneeling on his neck for nine minutes.It happened outside Cup Foods, a little store on 38th Street, just down the street from where we operate and live. People gathered there to express their sorrow, and anger quite frankly.They started moving toward the police precinct about a mile and a half away. It was peaceful and the crowd started to grow. I don\u0027t know what the tipping point was but at some point the police used tear gas and rubber bullets.We\u0027ve had police killings in Minnesota before. There was Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s different this time.I don\u0027t think anything is particularly different, except maybe social media. This murder was filmed by a bystander in the community.Really, I think the main difference is that we\u0027re just tired. People in my city are really tired of this and we just want to see the police held accountable, we\u0027re exhausted with it. There are people in positions of power who just continue to want to keep us in our place and we just are not having it any more.What\u0027s happening now is cross-class, cross-race, cross generational. We are all unifying. There are young people, women, everyone.But the reaction across the country has been amazing and it sends us a signal. The world is watching the twin cities right now and it is very validating.We have had gains and wins since the 1960s but what\u0027s still happening is extremely disappointing and upsetting. It\u0027s important to remember the gain, especially in the depressed state we are in now in this communal circumstance of pandemic and unrest.To press through and find joy, that\u0027s going to get us through. I would just say to people, these are the trials that will help us shape the world we want to live in.In the days since George Floyd\u0027s murder white supremacists have come from outside the twin cities, to the south side of Minneapolis. It\u0027s a historically predominantly black area and they came in to set fires and to loot. It\u0027s a really unstable situation.We\u0027re having to take care of ourselves on a block by block basis, to share information and food and raise money.People take shifts on vigil to chase away people that don\u0027t live here. There are a lot of cars around that don\u0027t have licence plates.I\u0027ve lived here my whole life and I\u0027ve never experienced anything like this. We are dealing with a whole new level of anti-blackness.People in our community are not going to damage our own buildings and businesses. We\u0027re not going to torch them. It\u0027s definitely outside elements. And messages from the president in his bunker aren\u0027t helping. He\u0027s blaming Antifa which isn\u0027t even an organisation, it\u0027s an ideology.I was driving around with my son and there are National Guard on every corner. My son is traumatised.We have black hawk helicopters circling our neighbourhood, shaking our house. My son is cuddling up in my bed and he\u0027s not a cuddler.

Portugal has been quick off the mark in establishing a clean and safe stamp for its hotels, while beaches are due to reopen fully on June 6 with enforced social distancing and a traffic light system indicating occupancy levels.Mr Silva\u0027s comments come as Italy reopens to European travellers today without quarantine restrictions in a bid to revive tourism – and the country\u0027s economy – for the start of the summer season. Italy is facing its deepest recession since the Second World War after three months of strict lockdown. Free movement within the country will boost domestic tourism, while international flights are only expected to resume in the three main cities of Milan, Rome and Naples.The southern region\u0027s governor, Jole Santelli, has said: Come to Calabria. There\u0027s only one risk: that you\u0027ll get fat. But experts have warned that with dozens of new cases still being reported there every day, particularly in the worst-affected northern Lombardy region, it may still be too early to allow widespread domestic or international tourism.The Home Secretary, Priti Patel, in a statement to the House of Commons, said the government\u0027s quarantine plans for international arrivals will initially be reviewed on June 28, after they come into effect on Monday, while discussions begin to establish \u0027travel corridors\u0027 or \u0027air bridges\u0027.Follow the latest news below.Commercial flights will resume to Malta\u0027s airport from July 1 Travel will only be permitted to a short list of destinations at first, which unfortunately does not currently include the UK. Ireland is on the list, as is Germany, Austria, Sicily, Cyprus, Switzerland, Sardinia, Iceland, Slovakia, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, Finland, Lithuania, Israel, Latvia, Estonia, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic. Visitors will take infrared temperature checks and fill in locator forms on arrival, but it is still unclear whether they will have to take Covid-19 tests. Dr Gavin Gulia, Chair of the Malta Tourism Authority, said of the country\u0027s confirmed opening date:Now that the situation is improving in many countries, and we can finally reopen our borders, we look forward with cautious optimism.The Thai government has announced it will be lifting all lockdown restrictions from July 1, including those on inter-provincial and international travel. Secretary-general, General Somsak Roongsita, said the lifting of all restrictions would mean a complete reopening of the country. While exact guidelines for international travellers haven’t yet been announced, the Tourism Authority of Thailand has said it is looking at offering long-stay packages in isolated areas that can be controlled, such as Koh Samui and Koh Pha Ngan. People will also be expected to wear face masks, follow social distancing and wash their hands regularly.Brits could still be unable to visit the country however, if our coronavirus record remains poor. Thailand will be looking at restrictions on who can visit, said Governor for the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn. He told CNN that Thailand would look at tourists\u0027 country of origin, to see if their situation has truly improved.As airlines resume their flying schedules, it will dawn on passengers that air travel will not be as it once was.In a post-pandemic world, a number of measures have been introduced to help lessen the spread of the coronavirus. Along with changes such as extended boarding protocols, restrictions regarding the use of on-board bathrooms and removal of in-flight magazines, some carriers are asking passengers to wear face masks.Charlotte Johnstone has the lowdown – from which airlines have made face masks mandatory, to when you have to wear them, what happens if you don\u0027t have one, and whether you can eat and drink.There is a glimmer of hope for Britons looking for their cruise fix this summer after Viking teased the possibility of operating summer sailings around the UK, reports Benjamin Parker.Dates and details on the itineraries can’t be revealed yet, a spokesperson told The , with the focus right now on “feasibility and asking UK guests to register their interest”.

It has now accelerated that move by lifting checks for other neighbours tomorrow.Austria\u0026#39s neighbours (except those from Italy) will be able to return to ViennaMr Schallenberg said at a press conference:“We will lift all the coronavirus-related border and health checks in relation to seven bordering countries - Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary.We are thereby returning to the pre-corona situation regarding these countries. For Italy, unfortunately the pandemic figures do not yet allow such a step. I emphasise, not yet.When can we go on holiday again?There is no point in arguing over the UK’s quarantine policy so long as there is no end in sight to the Foreign Office travel ban – according to a growing number of travel experts as controversy rumbles on over the Government’s plan to ask all international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days from June 8. Lloyd Figgins, international risk expert and chairman of the Trip Group, said:“The Foreign Office advice is to best protect its citizens, and until that advice changes no one is going anywhere. This is why when airlines say they are going to be putting on flights in July, it’s not helpful as the Foreign Office advice is still against all but essential travel.Hugh Morris has the full story.Mary Lussiana sends a dispatch from on the ground as Portugal stirs – and it sounds promising. She writes:I went, with my family, to Quinta do Lago, the manicured California of the Algarve, to eat at Casa do Lago on their first day of opening. It was so easy. Yes, the waiters wore masks, as we did to arrive. But seated in the open air (a huge strength of the Algarve in a Covid-19 world is the predominance of al fresco restaurants) with an excellent plate of calamari in tempura with a chilli dip in front of us, we soon forgot the tribulations of the previous weeks and basked in the atmosphere of the restaurant. The sun shone, music played, the dishes kept coming.Meanwhile in hotels, the DGS (Portuguese General Directorate of Health) has created a bible of ‘Clean \u0026amp Safe’ – the rules of which, when implemented, allow hotels to display a seal indicating that they have put the measures in place. They are rigorous and – compared to my stay at a hotel around the beginning of lockdown when bottles of alcohol gel were really the only addition to hotel life – stringent. Now, temperature readings at check in are the new normal.Portugal has relentlessly and impressively been on top of the Covid-19 crisis and this attention to detail ensuring that it is ready for the tourists it needs is the icing on the cake.Read the full story on how the beloved Algarve will reopen.Priti Patel has confirmed that the first review of the government\u0027s 14-day quarantine plan, which comes into effect on Monday, will be on June 28.Addressing MPs in the House of Commons, the Home Secretary also said she and the Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, will host a round-table discussion tomorrow to help form a long-term plan for the travel industry.  Travel corridors – mutual quarantine exemptions between the UK and other countries with similar infection rates – will be considered in a bid to explore all options for future safe travel.Ms Patel described the government\u0027s approach as proportionate and time limited, echoing her defence of the plans in The  along with Mr Shapps.We are working with the transport industry to see how we can introduce agreements with other countries when safe to do so, so we can go abroad and tourists can come here.Read more here.The Males has backtracked on plans to introduce a raft of expensive Covid-19 precautions for tourists entering the country when borders reopen sometime in July, reports Lee Cobaj.In a dramatic U-turn, tourism officials announced that they will now offer cheaper holidays to the upmarket Indian Ocean destination, while scrapping the fees proposed in their original reopening plan. These first-draft fees included a US$100 (£80) visa fee (before the pandemic, a free 30-day visa on arrival was available for all British visitors), plus the same fee again for a COVID-19 antigen test on arrival at the airport.Greece has suspended flights to Qatar after 12 passengers on a plane from Doha to Athens tested positive for Covid-19. The Qatar Airways flight, which landed in Greece on Monday, was carrying 91 passengers. The passengers were taken to a quarantine hotel. Those who tested positive will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and those who tested negative will remain in quarantine for seven days, according to the country\u0027s Civil Protection Ministry. Following these epidemiological facts, flights from and to Qatar are suspended until June 15, the ministry said in a statement.Among those who tested positive were nine passengers from Pakistan with Greek residency papers, two Greeks travelling from Australia and a member of a Greek-Japanese family, reported Reuters. Greece has recorded a low number of Covid-19 infections compared to many other European countries. As of June 3 it had registered 2,937 cases and 179 deaths as a result of the virus.When can we travel to Greece again?Germany\u0027s plans to lift the current travel ban for all European Union member states includes Britain as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland - but there is a key caveat. Travel is only permitted provided there are no entry bans or large-scale lockdowns in the reciprocal country, according to a report by Reuters that quotes Germany\u0027s foreign minister Heiko Maas.  As it stands with Britain largely still in lockdown and due to instate a 14-day quarantine on all arrivals from June 8, Heiko Mass added that Germans would be urged not to travel to Britain when not essential until the quarantine is lifted. Norway is in the same position owing to its own entry ban, and Germany is yet to decide on whether to extend the entry ban to Spain as well.The decision from Germany to reopen travel to many countries on June 15 signals a wider move away from the blanket travel restrictions that were in place across Europe throughout April and May.Should you risk booking a holiday now? Nick Trend has the answers.Europe\u0027s biggest budget airline has rejected the UK Government’s 14-day quarantine as ineffective and useless. Ryanair argues that for a quarantine to be effective, inbound passengers arriving at ports and airports need to be “detained” at their point of arrival.The government however proposes to collect mobile phone numbers from inbound visitors, but then allow them to travel on the London underground, the Heathrow Express, the Gatwick Express, the bus network, andor taxis to and from London, and tofrom every other airport in the UK, giving opportunity to spread the virus.Furthermore there is nothing to stop these visitors collecting groceries or any other essentials before arriving at their quarantine address. Less than one per cent of visitors will be contacted to check on them, and via mobile phone, which could be answered from anywhere.A spokesperson for Ryanair said:“This 14-day UK quarantine is ineffective, completely useless, and will have no effect on British passengers who will largely ignore it. At a time when the medical science across Europe, in countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Germany, have safely removed all inbound visitor restrictions, the imposition of this completely defective quarantine in the UK is utterly useless and a total waste of time.Read more on the airline\u0027s plans to restart flights.As  Travel\u0027s Portugal expert, Mary Lussiana would say that – but she\u0027d be more than justified in doing so. She writes:In the new dawn of travel, when the starting gun has sounded and we are all longing for a taste of the unknown, exotic or merely different, Portugal is that rare thing of being near but with beaches that rival the Caribbean, of being foreign but familiar.Now emerging, impressively unscathed, from Covid-19, the Algarve is throwing open its shutters. Restaurants are back in business, albeit at 50 per cent capacity to allow for social distancing, and they will be followed, during June and early July, by hotels across the region, displaying the Clean \u0026amp Safe seal created by the tourism board to signify all necessary health regulations have been complied with. Add to that hints of a possible “air bridge” arrangement with the UK and just possibly we can dare to dream again.A tram in Lisbon, Portugal\u0026#39s capitalRead her full and compelling list here.Commercial domestic flights will have resumed at London City Airport by the end of this month, with international flights restarting in early July.The airport, located close to the capital\u0027s financial district has been completely closed since March 25.

The system will be based on the traffic light, and Britain falls into the red category, which is deemed the riskiest and so requires extra precautions such as taking a coronavirus test. In order to enter the Czech Republic, those travelling or returning from \u0027red\u0027 countries will be required to present a negative test. Sweden is also in the red category.\u0027Green\u0027 countries include Germany, Austria, Croatia, and Greece among others this is the category deemed the safest and so there are no restrictions on travel. It is not a requirement for travellers from these countries to present a test.Free movement will also be restored with neighbouring Slovakia from midnight tonight.

Outstanding balances on loans fell by a further £2.4bn, taking total consumer credit lending to £64bn, the Bank of England said.The fall in net borrowing was primarily driven by consumers taking out less new credit than in previous months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBorrowers benefited from a sharp reduction in overdraft interest rates to just under 11 per cent, some 15 percentage points lower than the previous average.Under pressure from regulators to help struggling customers, banks have introduced £500 interest-free overdraft buffers.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The figures raise questions for the Treasury as it attempts to get Britain’s economy back on its feet.While ministers may welcome a reduction in high-cost borrowing, the figures also point to a sharp drop-off in consumer spending which will severely hurt many businesses.“Households have reduced the amount they are borrowing in consumer credit as spending has fallen with Covid-19,” the Bank said.With benefit claims rising at their fastest rate ever and the threat of millions more becoming jobless as the government’s job retention scheme tapers off over coming months, there is a risk that demand for goods and services will crash further, an outcome that could put companies out of business, thereby deepening and prolonging the recession.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, forecast that spending and borrowing would rebound this month, as shops re-open their doors.He added: “But we doubt that households will spend the cash they have accumulated during the lockdown soon, given heightened job insecurity and lingering concerns about catching the virus.”The Bank of England’s data also showed that mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since comparable records began in 1993.“Mortgage approvals likely will snap back too, now that in-person property viewings are allowed,” said Mr Tombs. “But with mortgage rates having fallen only marginally so far this year, unemployment set to rise and banks intending to restrict the supply of secured credit, we expect mortgage lending to remain at least 10 per cent below its pre-virus peak in the second half of this year.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Nissan has warned that its Sunderland factory will be unsustainable if the UK does not secure a trade deal with the EU.The company’s chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta poured cold water on optimistic speculation that the plant, which employs more than 6,000 people, would be protected from job cuts.Nissan announced last week that it would close a plant in Barcelona with the loss of 2,800 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive to help deal with plunging demand for vehicles.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo redundancies were announced for the Sunderland plant and a spokesperson said at the time that it remained “an important part of our plans for the European business”.However, Mr Gupta told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday that the factory’s future was dependent on a deal being struck to preserve tariff-free access to the EU.Nissan closes Barcelona plant but spares UK factory from job cutsMr Gupta said: “You know we are the number one car maker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed.“Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it’s not our intention but the business will not be sustainable.“That’s what everybody has to understand.”There had been reports that Renault, which forms part of an alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi, would move some of its production from mainland Europe to Sunderland, but Mr Gupta said the decisions was a matter for Renault alone. When pressed on the matter he said that “absolutely no decision has been made”.Trade talks with the EU are ongoing but time is running out before the transition period ends on 31 December. If a deal is not struck by that date, UK government ministers have said that they intend to go ahead with trading on World Trade Organisation terms rather than extending the transition period.That would mean tariffs on a range of goods including cars. Under tariff plans announced by the government in March, cars imported into the UK will be subject to a 10 per cent duty (about £1,500 for the average new car) which manufacturers including Volkswagen have said would be passed on to consumers.

That would offer some help to companies that make and sell a lot of cars in the UK but would need to be balanced against the increased cost of selling into the EU. The majority of cars made in the UK are exported, with the EU currently accounting for half of those sales.If no trade deal is reached, cars made in the UK and exported to the EU would be subject to a 10 per cent tariff. Nissan and Ford suspend car production due to Covid-19Nissan pushes on with £400m investment in UK plant despite BrexitFour ways the Brexit transition period could still be extendedEU Brexit trade demands won’t change to suit UK, Brussels saysFarmers fear government might slash tariffs on US food importsFord said at the time that the planned tariff regime would “deal a devastating blow to much of the complex and integrated automotive industry, and would damage the competitiveness of Ford’s engine manufacturing in the UK”.Nissan’s Sunderland plant is a major employer in the northeast of England and supports thousands more jobs through its supply chains.The factory – considered to be among the most advanced car production lines in Europe – has been at the centre of a row over Brexit since former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn warned back in 2016 that its future could not be guaranteed because of tariffs that might be imposed.Theresa May’s government offered assurances to Nissan in order to keep the plant open but repeatedly refused to publish details of what promises were made. It was later revealed that the sweeteners included up to £80m of support for skills, training, research and development and training – as long as Nissan built its new Qashqai and X-Trail models in Britain. The company eventually decided to build the X-Trail in Japan.Despite concerns over the uncertainty of Britain’s trading relationship with the EU, Nissan said in March that it would go ahead with a £400m investment at the Sunderland site. Less than two weeks later, production was suspended after coronavirus prompted a drop in demand and caused difficulty importing parts from Japan. Last week, Nissan reported its annual global sales had fallen 6.9 per cent. Europe was hit hardest with a drop of 19.1 per cent.The company reported an annual operating loss of 40 billion yen (£300m) for the year to 31 March, its worst performance since the tail end of the financial crisis in 2008-09.It sold 4.8 million vehicles during the period, down 13 per cent on last year, allowing Honda to take its position as Japan’s second biggest car manufacturer behind world-leader Toyota.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Triple Point are delighted to have partnered with the Evening Standard to fund the next generation of talented founders during this difficult time“.Some of the world’s most spectacular business success stories have born in times of recession. Around 20 so-called “unicorn” companies – start-ups which are now worth over $1bn (£800m) – were launched in the darkest days of the global financial crisis. These include Airbnb, Slack and Pinterest, as well as Uber.Russ Shaw of lobby group Tech London Advocates, said: “This will be a hugely popular initiative. We are hearing from a lot startups who are struggling to get funding and it is those in the earliest stage businesses that are hurting the most. The very people this fund is aiming at.”The UK government has recognised the importance new businesses will have in employing people likely to be losing their jobs in the coming months. It has set aside £500m for early stage companies in its Future Fund.The post-coronavirus world will offer new investment opportunitiesCoronavirus will strengthen the case for responsible investingThe start-ups fighting to feed the nation during this moment of crisisWhile that has been inundated with applications and is welcomed by entrepreneurs, the Future Fund is only available to firms who have already raised £250,000 in private investment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Outstanding balances on loans fell by a further £2.4bn, taking total consumer credit lending to £64bn, the Bank of England said.The fall in net borrowing was primarily driven by consumers taking out less new credit than in previous months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBorrowers benefited from a sharp reduction in overdraft interest rates to just under 11 per cent, some 15 percentage points lower than the previous average.Under pressure from regulators to help struggling customers, banks have introduced £500 interest-free overdraft buffers.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The figures raise questions for the Treasury as it attempts to get Britain’s economy back on its feet.While ministers may welcome a reduction in high-cost borrowing, the figures also point to a sharp drop-off in consumer spending which will severely hurt many businesses.“Households have reduced the amount they are borrowing in consumer credit as spending has fallen with Covid-19,” the Bank said.With benefit claims rising at their fastest rate ever and the threat of millions more becoming jobless as the government’s job retention scheme tapers off over coming months, there is a risk that demand for goods and services will crash further, an outcome that could put companies out of business, thereby deepening and prolonging the recession.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, forecast that spending and borrowing would rebound this month, as shops re-open their doors.He added: “But we doubt that households will spend the cash they have accumulated during the lockdown soon, given heightened job insecurity and lingering concerns about catching the virus.”The Bank of England’s data also showed that mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since comparable records began in 1993.“Mortgage approvals likely will snap back too, now that in-person property viewings are allowed,” said Mr Tombs. “But with mortgage rates having fallen only marginally so far this year, unemployment set to rise and banks intending to restrict the supply of secured credit, we expect mortgage lending to remain at least 10 per cent below its pre-virus peak in the second half of this year.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the Department for Health and Social Care has repeatedly failed to provide a daily testing figure in May, an omission which No 10 has been unable to explain.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the number of people tested remains unclear, the highest known daily total was 80,297 on 21 May. The health secretary revealed on Monday that capacity is now at 206,000, however this includes at least 40,000 antibody tests, which were counted towards the target after hospitals were instructed to start using them on Friday.The largest number of tests given on a single day was 164,757 on 19 May, with the most recent total at the time of writing on 31 May being less than 130,000.The government has acknowledged that large-scale testing and contact tracing will be vital to ending the lockdown, having promised in the earlier stages of the pandemic to eventually deliver 250,000 tests a day.After the government declared it had met its initial goal of providing 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April – a claim contested amid accusations of data manipulation – a new target for May was set.​This pledge was then watered down, with Downing Street stressing that the 200,000 target set by the PM related only to testing capacity and not to the number of tests actually carried out.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Nissan has warned that its Sunderland factory will be unsustainable if the UK does not secure a trade deal with the EU.The company’s chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta poured cold water on optimistic speculation that the plant, which employs more than 6,000 people, would be protected from job cuts.Nissan announced last week that it would close a plant in Barcelona with the loss of 2,800 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive to help deal with plunging demand for vehicles.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo redundancies were announced for the Sunderland plant and a spokesperson said at the time that it remained “an important part of our plans for the European business”.However, Mr Gupta told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday that the factory’s future was dependent on a deal being struck to preserve tariff-free access to the EU.Nissan closes Barcelona plant but spares UK factory from job cutsMr Gupta said: “You know we are the number one car maker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed.“Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it’s not our intention but the business will not be sustainable.“That’s what everybody has to understand.”There had been reports that Renault, which forms part of an alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi, would move some of its production from mainland Europe to Sunderland, but Mr Gupta said the decisions was a matter for Renault alone. When pressed on the matter he said that “absolutely no decision has been made”.Trade talks with the EU are ongoing but time is running out before the transition period ends on 31 December. If a deal is not struck by that date, UK government ministers have said that they intend to go ahead with trading on World Trade Organisation terms rather than extending the transition period.That would mean tariffs on a range of goods including cars. Under tariff plans announced by the government in March, cars imported into the UK will be subject to a 10 per cent duty (about £1,500 for the average new car) which manufacturers including Volkswagen have said would be passed on to consumers.

That would offer some help to companies that make and sell a lot of cars in the UK but would need to be balanced against the increased cost of selling into the EU. The majority of cars made in the UK are exported, with the EU currently accounting for half of those sales.If no trade deal is reached, cars made in the UK and exported to the EU would be subject to a 10 per cent tariff. Nissan and Ford suspend car production due to Covid-19Nissan pushes on with £400m investment in UK plant despite BrexitFour ways the Brexit transition period could still be extendedEU Brexit trade demands won’t change to suit UK, Brussels saysFarmers fear government might slash tariffs on US food importsFord said at the time that the planned tariff regime would “deal a devastating blow to much of the complex and integrated automotive industry, and would damage the competitiveness of Ford’s engine manufacturing in the UK”.Nissan’s Sunderland plant is a major employer in the northeast of England and supports thousands more jobs through its supply chains.The factory – considered to be among the most advanced car production lines in Europe – has been at the centre of a row over Brexit since former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn warned back in 2016 that its future could not be guaranteed because of tariffs that might be imposed.Theresa May’s government offered assurances to Nissan in order to keep the plant open but repeatedly refused to publish details of what promises were made. It was later revealed that the sweeteners included up to £80m of support for skills, training, research and development and training – as long as Nissan built its new Qashqai and X-Trail models in Britain. The company eventually decided to build the X-Trail in Japan.Despite concerns over the uncertainty of Britain’s trading relationship with the EU, Nissan said in March that it would go ahead with a £400m investment at the Sunderland site. Less than two weeks later, production was suspended after coronavirus prompted a drop in demand and caused difficulty importing parts from Japan. Last week, Nissan reported its annual global sales had fallen 6.9 per cent. Europe was hit hardest with a drop of 19.1 per cent.The company reported an annual operating loss of 40 billion yen (£300m) for the year to 31 March, its worst performance since the tail end of the financial crisis in 2008-09.It sold 4.8 million vehicles during the period, down 13 per cent on last year, allowing Honda to take its position as Japan’s second biggest car manufacturer behind world-leader Toyota.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the source of the bursts – which are so unusual they have been explained by everything from stars slamming together to alien technology – still remains mysterious.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFast radio bursts are very short, very intense blasts of energy that come to us from deep in space. They last just a milisecond but release more energy than our Sun emits in 80 years.They were first discovered in 2007, and scientists have spent the years since attempting to understand how something can give such bright but brief signals. But spotting them is difficult, since there is no way to predict where one may come from, and understanding their origin is even harder.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Now researchers have made a new breakthrough by looking at the precise location of four previously discovered fast radio bursts. Using the ASKAP radio telescope located in the Western Australian outback, astronomers were able to zoom in onto the host galaxies of the burst, in an attempt to understand whether their neighbourhoods could give any clue about where they are coming from.They found that all four of the bursts they studied appeared to come from massive galaxies that are forming new stars at a modest rate, like the Milky Way.While the process creating them still remains clear, the fact they are being ejected from the edges of their home galaxies does rule out some explanations of where they could be coming from.“These precisely localised fast radio bursts came from the outskirts of their home galaxies, removing the possibility that they have anything to do with supermassive black holes,” said Shivani Bhandari, a researcher at CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, who led the research which is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Last week, researchers revealed that they had used them as a measuring stick to find the universe\u0027s missing matter.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eventually they will form part of a 12,000-strong constellation designed to beam high-speed internet down to Earth.Elon Musk responds to Twitter time travel conspiracySpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed new details about how Starlink will work last month, stating on Twitter that it will only work for higher latitudes at first.This will cover places like Seattle and London to begin with, he said, before coverage progressively spreads closer to the equator.Created with Sketch.SpaceX Dragon heads back to earth after ISS mission Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Space X Dragon departs from the International Space Station and heads for earthSpace X Dragon undocks from the International Space StationSpaceX Crew Dragon is pictured about 20 meters (66 feet) away from the International Space StationA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on March 2 2019Astronauts aboard the Space Station preparing to open hatchet to the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummy after it successfully docked with Space StationA dummy(L) named Ripley onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraft onboard after the opening of the hatch during the Demo-1 missioNThe SpaceX team watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space StationSpaceX Falcon 9 rocket docked with the International Space Station during the Demo-1 missionA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraftAstronaut David Saint-Jacques taking a look inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummyA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off on an uncrewed test flightA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on an uncrewed test flight A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a demo Crew Dragon spacecraft on an uncrewed test flightSpaceX\u0027s new crew capsule approaches just before dockingAstronaut Eric Boe, assistant to the chief of the astronaut office for commercial crew, left, and Norm Knight, deputy director of flight operations at Nasa\u0027s Johnson Space Center watch the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraftSpace X Dragon departs from the International Space Station and heads for earthSpace X Dragon undocks from the International Space StationSpaceX Crew Dragon is pictured about 20 meters (66 feet) away from the International Space StationA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on March 2 2019Astronauts aboard the Space Station preparing to open hatchet to the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummy after it successfully docked with Space StationA dummy(L) named Ripley onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraft onboard after the opening of the hatch during the Demo-1 missioNThe SpaceX team watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space StationSpaceX Falcon 9 rocket docked with the International Space Station during the Demo-1 missionA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraftAstronaut David Saint-Jacques taking a look inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummyA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off on an uncrewed test flightA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on an uncrewed test flight A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a demo Crew Dragon spacecraft on an uncrewed test flightSpaceX\u0027s new crew capsule approaches just before dockingAstronaut Eric Boe, assistant to the chief of the astronaut office for commercial crew, left, and Norm Knight, deputy director of flight operations at Nasa\u0027s Johnson Space Center watch the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraftIn May, SpaceX signed a three-year deal with the US Army to test Starlink’s broadband internet service when connected to military systems.A report in SpaceNews claimed that the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (Crada) will evaluate potential applications and assess whether the Army invests further in the network.The swarms of satellite have drawn criticism from some astronomers, who claim that they disrupt optical and radio telescopes. Some even claim that the Starlink satellites could potentially even block sightings of Earth-bound asteroids.Trains of Starlink satellites have been visible following previous launches and continue to be visible at certain times.Following the last launch of Starlink satellites, Mr Musk said SpaceX was “taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness”.These measures include paining the underside of the satellites black and changing the angle of the solar panel at certain times.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The Independent’s sister newspaper, the Evening Standard, today launched a major drive to find and fund the next Uber or Deliveroo.It has teamed up with one of the UK’s leading venture capital firms, Triple Point, to offer £100,000 to £150,000 to the most promising start-up tech ideas.The Spirit of London Kickstart Fund was launched against the backdrop of a challenging time for start-ups, as investors are fearful of investing amid the economic uncertainty triggered by the Covid crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, while funding is proving difficult, the crisis is creating huge opportunities for entrepreneurs in areas such as health technology, education technology and retail technology as industries struggle with working under more restricted circumstances of lockdowns and work from home.Triple Point’s Daniel Cardenas-Clark said Covid-19 has lowered the cost of starting a business due to cheaper office rents and advertising rates, creating huge opportunities for start-up businesses. “The world is now a different place than it was before the lockdown and the way we used to do almost everything has changed.We are looking for great innovators to help the post-covid recoveryThis change has brought with it an array of opportunities for innovative start-ups and creative entrepreneurs.  Triple Point are delighted to have partnered with the Evening Standard to fund the next generation of talented founders during this difficult time“.Some of the world’s most spectacular business success stories have born in times of recession. Around 20 so-called “unicorn” companies – start-ups which are now worth over $1bn (£800m) – were launched in the darkest days of the global financial crisis. These include Airbnb, Slack and Pinterest, as well as Uber.Russ Shaw of lobby group Tech London Advocates, said: “This will be a hugely popular initiative. We are hearing from a lot startups who are struggling to get funding and it is those in the earliest stage businesses that are hurting the most. The very people this fund is aiming at.”The UK government has recognised the importance new businesses will have in employing people likely to be losing their jobs in the coming months. It has set aside £500m for early stage companies in its Future Fund.The post-coronavirus world will offer new investment opportunitiesCoronavirus will strengthen the case for responsible investingThe start-ups fighting to feed the nation during this moment of crisisWhile that has been inundated with applications and is welcomed by entrepreneurs, the Future Fund is only available to firms who have already raised £250,000 in private investment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The satellites can also be tracked in real-time through the Find Starlink website.They form part of Elon Musk’s project to deliver space-based internet and will eventually be part of a 12,000-strong constellation of satellites.Previous occasions when Starlink satellites have appeared have resulted in a spike of UFO reports due to their unusual formation.How to see SpaceX Starlink satellites in the sky this weekAstronomers have compared their appearance to that of a “string of bright pearls” in the sky, though some have criticised them for potentially disrupting observations.The Starlink project was described as a “tragedy” last year by Dave Clements, an astrophysicist at Imperial College London. He warned that the presence of vast satellite constellations could interrupt radio frequencies and disrupt images from optical telescopes, which may obscure sightings of Earth-bound asteroids.SpaceX said it is working with space agencies to minimise any potential impact of the Starlink satellites, while also taking a number of its own measures to reduce their visibility.Following April’s launch, CEO Elon Musk said he is working on a solution to hide the satellites from ground-based observers.“We’re fixing it now,” he tweeted. “We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness.. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle and all satellites get sunshades starting with launch nine.”Created with Sketch.Jeff Bezos\u0027 plan for future space colonies Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceAn artist rendering of the future space colony that Jeff Bezos envisions as the future home of the human raceJeff Bezos introducing a life-size model of the Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could move many tons of cargo between earth and the moonAn artist rendering of Blue Moon on the surface of the moonBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerThe Blue Moon would be powered by the BE-7 engineBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerBezos also announced that his company Blue Origin will meet the current Administration\u0027s goal of putting Americans on the Moon by 2024 with the Blue Moon lunar landerWhen questioned about the Starlink satellites’ potential interference at a recent conference, he said that concerns were being exaggerated.“I am confident that we will not cause any impact whatsoever in astronomical discoveries, zero. That’s my prediction,” he said at the Satellite 2020 conference in January. “We will take corrective action if it’s above zero. I’ve not met someone who can tell me where all of them are, so it can’t be that big of a deal.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are some of the stories behind the statistics:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines‘I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics’: The NHS worker with no support from the stateTheo Manugerwa was struggling before the coronavirus crisis began. The 47-year-old, who lives with her two daughters aged 12 and 10 in Leicester, has been working in the NHS for 11 years, but her immigration status means she has no recourse to public funds (NRPF) – meaning she cannot claim any form of state support. As a result, the single mother has always had to work overtime in order to afford rent and provide for her children.Since lockdown started, Theo has been unable to work the extra hours.Her children are still going to school as she is a key worker, but after-school clubs are no longer operating and the friends who used to look after them while she was at work are no longer able to, due to the lockdown.She says: “It has become very hard. Once I take off my rent, I’m left with nothing at all. It has always been difficult, from the day they gave me that NRPF condition, but at least I could get extra shifts here and there to put food on the table for my children.How to support our campaign“The money I’m making now is not enough to cater for the three of us. We are depending on charity. I’ve always been very proud. I didn’t want to give in and ask for help. The feeling when you walk into a food bank is very painful. I work so hard yet I can’t afford the basics.”Theo, a Ugandan national who moved to the UK 20 years ago, is due to apply for her next visa extension next month, at a cost of more than £2,000, and she says the thought of it makes her feel sick. The Home Office told The Independent it would help Theo apply to get access to benefits under measures introduced to tackle the pandemic. But for now, she has also fallen into rent arrears, and fears she is going to generate serious debt. “I just need some support. I have no support at all. You get tired of depending on people. You don’t want to keep telling people your problems. I feel undervalued as a health worker during this time.“I feel abandoned. I’ve always worked hard to provide for my children, but it makes me feel like I’ve let them down.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Both financially and mentally,” says Sian Abbott. The 28-year-old’s family of seven started using food banks about a year ago when her husband lost his job as a poultry farmer – and she says things have become even more difficult during the Covid-19 crisis.Sian, who lives in Pembrokeshire and has five children, aged between 10 and three, says: “Three weeks into the pandemic I had a breakdown. We ran out of food because the food bank people couldn’t get to us. I ended up reaching out to my church and they sent us an emergency supply package.“It’s stressful, especially with the school closures. At least when the kids were in school they were able to get a meal. My husband and I go without meals sometimes so the children can eat.”Sian, who previously worked as a taxi controller and a carer but had to stop working to look after her autistic son, says she has noticed a lot more people who didn’t previously use food banks are now turning to them, but worries that the supply isn’t there.“In the supermarkets there used to be trolleys full of donations, but now there’s barely one. Prices are higher. The cost of nappies have nearly doubled, which is really difficult for us,” she adds.“It’s funny because when we first heard about food banks six years ago we were donating to them – usually around £50 or £60 a week – but now we’re having to rely on them ourselves.”Zoe Green and her husband David are “really struggling financially” for the very first time. The couple and their four children – aged from two to 11 – now depend on a weekly parcel from a food bank based at their local school in north London, a project supplied with fresh produce by The Felix Project charity.Ms Green, a 36-year-old freelancer who worked in TV and documentary production, hasn’t been able to find any work over the past few months. She received less than £1,000 pounds for a three-month period after applying for the government’s self-employment income support scheme.Although 39-year-old Mr Green still gets around £400 a month while on furlough from his part-time retail job, the couple have found they have a shortfall of around £300 a month for household bills. This is being met by The Film and TV Charity, but the couple do not know how long the emergency stipend will last.“It’s not been an easy time – we’ve never known food poverty until the coronavirus hit,” she said. “When we got the first food package from The Felix Project, I was literally crying as I took out all the fresh food. The work they and the other charities are doing right now is really, really appreciated. I never thought we’d need it.”“I’m really hoping the government will extend the self-employment scheme. I’m also hoping they might factor out the periods I was on maternity leave and wasn’t able to earn as much, so I can get a higher average amount.”‘Food banks have been a godsend’: Self-employed mother who isn’t eligible for government support Susan, 45, said she found herself in financial difficulty in the months before the pandemic after her fledging health drink business collapsed.The children going hungry during the coronavirus pandemicFood bank demand soars as newly unemployed wait weeks for benefitsAlthough she set herself up as a private education tutor in February 2020, she found she wasn’t eligible to apply for the government’s self-employment income support scheme after lockdown began.“I struggled to be able to buy food during the lockdown, as I’d lost income and also fell through the government net,” said the west Londoner. “It made a difficult situation even more difficult.”She and her two children, aged 10 and 12, are now relying on a weekly food bank set up at the Bollo Brook Youth Centre on her south Acton estate. “The children being at home is tough to manage. It’s stressful trying to keep up with it all and help with their school work whilst worrying about bills,” she said.“We’ve been fortunate and receive help with food that we would not have been able to buy. It’s been godsend to get us through this time until we can rebuild our lives back to normal.”‘It’s a battle to keep going’: Food bank manager whose demand is up tenfoldOriginally set up to provide support for single fathers, the Dads House charity now runs food banks for anyone in financial need at two sites in west and south London.Founder Billy McGranaghan said he and his volunteers saw between 30 and 50 people looking for help each day before the pandemic, but in the past couple of months demand for food parcels has shot up tenfold to between 300 and 500 people a day.“It’s heartbreaking to see the long queues,” he said. “The volume is something we’ve never seen before. It’s poverty like you’ve never seen. People tell us they’ve got £20 or £30 to get through the week. Some are telling us they’re having to sell possessions or borrow money from loan sharks.”Mr McGranaghan added: “Some people had been in very casual work before the crisis – bar staff, nannies, cleaners. So there’s no furloughing going on to help them. But in many cases they’re not necessarily self-employed either – they were dependant on that weekly wage. So they’re not eligible for the government self-employed scheme.”The food bank founder said many people were applying for universal credit, but they are forced to face at least five weeks before any money appears in their bank account.“I’m just hoping some people are able to get back into work when the shops re-open in a couple of weeks,” he said. “But at the moment it’s a battle for people to keep going.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

The Felix Project has supplied 1,376 tons of produce since 23 March, the equivalent of 3,276,190 meals. This support has ameliorated the deep distress of those unable to afford or access food – in particular, families struggling below the breadline, NHS workers and the elderly.The sum raised from sales of Hirst’s rainbow butterfly hearts means that we are more than halfway to our goal of securing £10m for The Felix Project to help food-poor Londoners over the next three years. It is a pledge given added urgency by the latest jobless claims, which have surged to more than two million.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 4,400 people backed our campaign by purchasing the Hirst limited edition prints – 3,109 bought the small size, costing £300 each, and 1,299 bought the large size, costing £1,000. The net proceeds amounted to £1.55m. Mr Hirst said: “It’s amazing to see how people have pulled together and helped each other during this crisis. I am so grateful to everyone who has helped me do my little bit and bought a butterfly heart edition – it’s turned out to be a brilliant communal way to help raise money for The Felix Project and support their important work across London.”How to support our campaignEvgeny Lebedev, shareholder in The Independent, said: “I have long believed in the power of art and this is a wonderful affirmation of that. With the support of Damien Hirst we have passed the halfway point in our mission to ensure no Londoner in any corner of the city goes hungry because of Covid.”Other substantial new donors to our campaign include management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Company, whose employees voted to make our appeal partner their charity of choice.Olga Nefedova, associate partner, said: “We are making a donation to organisations helping our most vulnerable communities. The Felix Project is very much one of these organisations.”So far, more than six million meals have been delivered by the London Food Alliance – established in response to the coronavirus pandemic and made up of Felix, FareShare and City Harvest – of which over half have been supplied by The Felix Project.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, paid tribute to the extraordinary all-round effort. “London was hit hard and fast – but oh, how it has stepped up and fought back,” he said. “We are inspired by the mobilisation of businesses, donors and supporters who have joined forces with our staff and volunteers.” The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

I feel so angry, isolated, desperate to talk to someone. I have been contacting people I lost touch with a long time ago, just to have someone to talk to.”Ms Olley, who is 73 and has no television and only last week bought a computer, said staying in her London home of 40 years was having an impact on her physically.“I am beginning to feel old,” she said. “I sit on the sofa and don’t move much, so you feel like an old lady. You see people out and about and you’re stuck inside. You want to go out but I have been feeling fearful about coronavirus because of my age. You see people outside and think, ‘How come they get to go out? Why can’t I?’”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor many people over 70 who have been told to self-isolate, the pandemic has been a mental and physical challenge. For some, it has also meant extra anxiety of being unable to access food easily.Ms Olley has come to rely for her daily meals on a doughty little charity called Made in Hackney, a cookery school delivering food supplied by our appeal partner, The Felix Project. The charity supplies 500 nutritious meals a day to the borough’s most vulnerable and nearly half its beneficiaries are over 70. Although the service was due to stop on 17 June, it is fundraising so the team can continue.How to support our campaignShe added: “Knowing that someone would come to my house and see if I was dead or alive every day – it sounds bad, but it is reassuring. The volunteers have been wonderful. They ring you occasionally to check in as well.”Another Made in Hackney beneficiary is Nigel Howat, 79, a former sightseeing bus company boss who has lived in his Hackney housing association accommodation for more than 20 years.Due to his age, he sometimes struggles to breathe. He also has a gluten intolerance, with wheat products making him violently ill. While he has neighbours to chat to from a safe distance, he has been missing his family. His stepson, Darren, was recently diagnosed with lymphoid cancer.“He lives in Merton and I haven’t seen him since his diagnosis,” said Mr Howat. “Normally I would be there to support him, but that is impossible at the moment, so it’s been hard.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The charity suggests up to 2.4 million people aged 70 and over have difficulty with at least one element of daily living.Angus Wyllie, 72, from Barnet, has struggled with cooking and operating his iPad to keep in touch with his relatives.“I am more of a ‘put a ready meal in the oven’ kind of person,” he admitted. “My iPad packed up early into lockdown which meant I couldn’t contact people, or get deliveries.”He has benefited from the largesse of Katie-Louise Barber who has been cooking hundreds of meals from Felix-supplied produce out of her home in Barnet since the start of the pandemic. She delivers her food parcels across London every week and about half are to the elderly.Top chefs ‘rhyme for restaurants’ in support of our appealIt’s a laugh cooking with kids, says actor David MorrisseyHelp the Hungry tops £5.5m following successful Hirst heart sale“Katie has been a lifesaver,” Mr Wyllie said. “She has been delivering to a few neighbours including a family of three nearby who have been struggling.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

The education committee was told such a programme had not been costed, but Ms Longfield added: “The risk of not doing that would be the deficit in learning for those children.”Reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils began returning to schools this week, but a plan to get all primary children back for a month before the summer appears to have been dropped.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A clear and obvious case,” he added.His intervention came after Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, defended the government’s plan to end virtual voting – a system put in place in April during the the height of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK.Mr Rees-Mogg insisted those MPs shielding or self-isolating due to Covid-19 would be able to continue to participate in parliamentary debates and questions virtually, but said the practice of online voting would come to an end.During the first physical votes on Tuesday since ending the virtual parliament, MPs criticised “ludicrous scenes” and images that circulated on social media showing members in long queues stretching across the Palace of Westminster.Ress-Mogg faces backlash as government ends virtual voting for MPsIn his response to Sir Keir on Wednesday, Mr Johnson added: “He needs to consider what is going on throughout the country where ordinary people are getting used to queueing for long periods of time to do their shopping or whatever it happens to be.“I must say I do not think it unreasonable that we should ask parliamentarians to come back to this place and do their job. I know it’s difficult, I apologise to colleagues for the inconvenience.“I apologise to those with particular difficulties because they are shielding or they are elderly and it’s vital they should know the changes we are making today they should be able to vote by proxy.”In a statement published yesterday, the Equality and Human Rights Commission also wrote to all MPs warning the proposals to end remote voting will “place at significant disadvantage MPs who are shielding or self-isolating”.“It cannot be right for parliament to proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person,” they added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

and the number can inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that each sick person will pass the disease on to three more people -no containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.If the R rate of a disease is one or above, it will spread exponentially, infecting more and more people.Therefore, being below R is key because it means the virus will likely peter out.Scientists work backwards to estimate the R rate, as we can’t know the exact moment people are infected.A range of data is used, such as ICU admissions, hospital admissions, deaths and positive tests.It takes two to three weeks for changes in the R rate to be shown in this data, due to the time gap between infection and the need for treatment. The World Health Organisationestimated at the beginning of March that the coronavirus R rate stood between  and . - meaning the spread of the virus could snowball, with each infected person infecting between two and three others.Thanks to the lockdown and the social distancing measures that have been in place, the UK is now below that.In May, the R rate crept up, but it is thought that this is due to the outbreaks of the virus in care homes.In comparison, the R rate of the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly ., while for the highly infectious measles its between  and .Despite this, these figures are not set in stone because a given pathogens R value is constantly changing, as behaviour changes or immunity develops.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told The : R is an indication of how much an infectious virus will spread in a population, and ious things impact that value.The susceptibility, size and density of the population that the infection is introduced into matters, as well as the infectiousness of the virus itself.Predictions of the R for Covid- are currently ied because no one knows exactly how many people have been infected in total.According to modelling published by Imperial College London, the R value stood somewhere between  and . in Europe before lockdowns came into effect.We dont know the exact R rate for the UK right now as its an estimate thats constantly changing.But as of Friday, May , the nation-wide R-rate is said to be between . and ..This means that every infected inidual passes the disease to less than one other person.This shows the lockdown has had a positive impact on the coronavirus pandemic as to bring an outbreak under control the R value needs to fall below one.However,the number rises higher than one, the epidemic will grow, which could lead policymakers to tighten lockdown restrictions.Data released on May  from Cambridge University suggested that in the North East and Yorkshire the R rate - the average number of people an infected person can pass the virus on to - is feared to be at around ..On May , , Boris Johnson urged the British public to help reduce the R value.In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.He continued: And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. Sir Patrick admitted that the R value could be higher in some care homes and hospitals.He said: As I’ve said, it’s not true that the R is necessarily below one in every hospital or in every care home, and that’s the important area that we now need to look at and make sure that the appropriate measures are in place to try and reduce the R there.But it doesn’t change the overall view that I’ve described, that the R overall is below one and therefore we expect to see the slowing and the turn of the epidemic.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.  The social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is a lower chance for the virus to spread.More generally, a vaccination would help reduce the R rate of any given disease as this would mean that one infected person wouldnt be able to infect an inidual who had been given a vaccination.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children who have lost a term’s schooling are effectively immune and don’t spread the virus.We know thousands are missing le-saving early diagnosis and treatment for non-Covid diseases.We know depression, drugs and domestic abuse are costing lives.Yet there are virtually no new cases of Covid outside hospitals and care homes.Scientists think the virus was already petering out as the world pulled down the shutters.They can find no evidence that ending lockdown leads to a deadly second wave.How did we end up in this state of paralysed confusion The question must be put as soon as possible to a public inquiry led by a figure of impeccable authority.It will inevitably focus on “the Blob” — the well-meaning but short-sighted officials who think they run the country.If the inquiry does its job, it will shake up the vast NHS bureaucracy, bungling Public Health England and the poorly named Sage committee of scientic experts.It will find outthe so-called Care Quality Commission let down care homes and why the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat was caught with its pants down.It will swtly provide the basis for a shake-up of the entire civil service, whose mandarin class desperately needs reform as Britain takes on the world after Brexit.Their foam-flecked four-letter fury is matched only by their hypocrisy.Alastair Campbell is a sad relic of his former self.

Yes, the Prime Minister might feel uncomfortable singling out a specic town or city for draconian restrictions.But the economy must come before political niceties. And shutting down businesses in Cornwall because of a minor new outbreak in Newcastle would be economically bonkers.France — with a population comparable to the UK — introduced “red” and “green” zones when restrictions were first eased on May .

The entire show was given over to Dominic Cummings.None of it was funny, obviously. Have I Got News For You hasn’t been funny in years.What still slightly surprised me, however, was that they chose to believe every single negative story the Press had written about him, last week, including some of the stuff which, like the police hauling him in for questioning, was clearly a load of cobblers.Quite a contrast to the previous week when, based on one Mail on Sunday story, host Charlie Brooker asked: “Why do you think the Press has got it in for Keir Starmer ”Apart from the fact the entire Press hasn’t got it in for him , it’s the question’s assumption that gives the game away here.The BBC and HIGNFY have already decided Keir Starmer is great and will not tolerate any dissent.I’m grateful for it anyway, as it shines a light on the dumb equation that’s come to govern this show: Have I Got News For You believes every bad word written about the Government and disbelieves every bad word written of the Opposition.If a satirical show is stupid enough to put every politician it agrees withoff limits, it’s guaranteed to fail, which is why HIGNFY’s time has come and long gone and it deserves to be jettisoned as quickly as possible.For that to happen, though, the BBC would need to dismount its high horse, admit errors and bias and change its political culture entirely.So expect it to keep coming back.

They have croissants.”The real grit in the oyster, however, was actress Britt Ekland who, apart from those moments when she was chasing after multi-millionaire Duncan, always gave the impression she’d rather set fire to her own Wicker Man than spend one more second in India.Would she finally be converted to the idea, the last episode of the series asked, by spending a night at a luxury retirement complex, in the foothills of the Himalayas, with Henry Blofeld and Paul Chuckle Well, Britt arrived like a dry cough in the morning, but  hours later . . .“This is my ultimate hell.

Yet now the rate is going down we are going to start doing so.This will seem perverse to the millions of us who have complied with ­lockdown laws while seeing planes arrive from highly infected nations.While we are effectively ­closing our borders, other nations are loosening their restrictions and opening up their markets to foreign travel.Many British companies have offices and subsidiaries overseas but the bosses of those firms won’t be able to visit their foreign-based business centres because they will face a two-week quarantine upon their .It gives totally the wrong impression to the world.The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had rightly ­campaigned for Brexit on the basis that Britain would be an outward-looking nation. That won’t be possible with international travel curtailed.Travellers will want to be reassured that airlines are ­taking measures to counter the spread of the virus, so ­temperature checks could be put into place at UK airports.That would tell the authorities which passengers have symptoms of the virus.It would be better than the two-week quarantine, which would only prolong a terrible ­nightmare for the British ­tourism industry upon which so many livelihoods depend. Around  per cent of the ­British workforce — four ­million people — have jobs either in or linked to tourism in this country.The industry is worth £billion to the economy but since lockdown it has stalled.The winter months are quiet, the spring has been spent in lockdown and the summer months are the most crucial.When the Government’s­ ­furlough scheme comes to an end, businesses will face some very tough ­choices.I am concerned about my ,-strong workforce and the last thing I would want to do is lay off staff. But I have got £.million going out the window every month due to lockdown.There are many businesses in this country that will not be able to weather the storm.Tourist destinations across the country, such as the Cotswolds and Bronte country in West Yorkshire, rely heavily on foreign visitors.At my London hotels, more than  per cent of the ­business comes from overseas.To make matters worse, while most European countries — including Italy — have reduced the two-metre social distancing rule to one metre, just about making operating possible, we continue to persist with the two-metre ruling.How can you go to a restaurant where everyone will be two metres apart  How will staff serve you at a distance Of course, every Covid- death we have seen is a ­tragedy and my heart goes out to the families of the victims.But the reality of the disease is that for the majority of the population, the virus is not deadly unless there are underlying health issues.I am  and had three bad weeks with the virus — a week of high temperature, a week of gradually losing the symptoms and a third week where I was like a wet rag.At my age, it takes four or five weeks to properly recover from it.We must not lose sight of the number of livelihoods that have already been seriously damaged and the millions of people who will find themselves out of jobs at the end of lockdown.For the tourism industry, which has already been brought to a standstill, the two-week quarantine would be the final nail in the coffin.Let’s keep Britain open, so there is hope for the future.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the Black Panther Party has long used it as a symbol of resistance.In the sporting world, US runner John Carlos made history by raising a black-gloved fist on the podium at the  Olympics to protest against racism.A bronze medallist in the  metre sprint in Mexico City in , Carlos joined the gold medallist, fellow black American Tommie Smith, in raising his fist and bowing his head on the podium while Americas national anthem was playing.The men’s protest against racism and in favour of “black power” marked a milestone in the civil rights movement in their home country and is an iconic image in Olympic history.John Carlos later explained to Le Monde: “When you make that kind of public declaration, you send a message of courage to the world.”These days, raised fists are also strongly associated with the Black Lives Matter movements fight against racism.Black Lives Matter was founded by three women who popularised the slogan during protests over the  killing of Trayvon Martin, an African-American teen who was shot by George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida.Zimmerman was acquitted of second degree murder and manslaughter.The Black Lives Matter movement began with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media, and grew into a nationwide movement in response to the use of excessive force by police, particularly against black men.Its website explains that BLM is a global organisation in the US, UK, and Canada, whose mission is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.Before the clenched fists became synonymous with the movement, however, raised hands were seen at rallies to symbolise the hands up, dont shoot slogan.Khanya Dalton wrote about this gesture in a column for The Black  White, the student news website for Walt Whitman High School in Maryland, US.Dalton explains that the “hands up, don’t shoot slogan, along with the accompanying gesture of raising one’s hands above his or her head, became one of the core symbols of the Black Lives Matter movement after unarmed -year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer [in Missouri], in August .Brown reportedly was holding his hands above his head and mouthing the words don’t shoot as the fatal shot was fired while this claim was later debunked, the image has stuck.Since [then], the mantra has been used in protests against police brutality around the country.The hands up, dont shoot gesture has recently been seen at rallies along with the clenched fist gesture in the wake of the brutal death of George Floyd - an unarmed black American who died in police custody in Minneapolis.Video showed a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes before he died.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Conventional wisdom about sound money and financial prudence has disappeared.Until recently the enemies of socialism, the Conservatives have now become converts to government action.Mrs Thatcher famously talked about “rolling back the frontiers of the state.”Now, in the wake of the Covid crisis, they have come sweeping forward once more.In the process, the public finances have taken a battering.In April the Government borrowed over £billion, a larger sum than for the whole of .The fiscal deficit is now projected to reach no less than £billion, perhaps even £billion in the worst case scenario.At the same time, more than million people — more than half the entire national workforce — are effectively on the state payroll.Even as lockdown eases, much of the economy has now been taken into the custody of the state.All this has to be paid for — and the bills cannot be met simply by printing more money.That is the route to a debased currency, soaring interest rates and hyperinflation.The reality is that massive state intervention is simply not sustainable except in an emergency.If printing money were the recipe for prosperity, then Zimbabwe would be the richest country on earth rather than mired in poverty.That is the lesson of history.If the Government carries on spending and intervening on a level that would have even made Jeremy Corbyn blush, then our country will be in real danger of sliding back to the dark days of the s.Gripped by industrial unrest and economic decline, Britain then was known as the “sick man of Europe”.Because of extravagant spending, the public finances were in a desperate state. In  inflation reached  per cent.The following year, Britain’s deficit was so enormous that the Government humiliatingly had to ask for a £.billion handout from the IMF.With the economy limping from one crisis to another, taxes soared, with the top rate on “unearned income” reaching  per cent.Some of the revenue was swallowed up in bailouts of troubled companies.In  the engine and car maker Rolls-Royce was rescued, followed by the Upper Clyde shipbuilders in  and volume motor manufacturer British Leyland in .Indeed, this was an era of institutionalised bullying by the strike-happy trade unions, who held the Government and the nation to ransom by flexing their industrial muscle.When Sir Horace Cutler, the Tory leader of the Greater London Council in the late s, was asked how many people work for London Transport, he replied, “about half of them.”In , which saw the Winter of Discontent, no fewer than million working days were lost to stoppages.At the peak of the disruption, bodies were left unburied and rubbish piled high in the street.The very fabric of society appeared to be falling part.“There is madness in the air,” recorded Bernard Donoghue, an aide to the Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.It was precisely the public’s revulsion at failed socialism and trade union irresponsibility that brought Margaret Thatcher to power in  on a  of reviving the economy.She achieved it by taming the unions, reinvigorating enterprise, restoring the work ethic and shrinking the Government.We need the same again today. All the good work of the last four decades will be undonewe slide back into the dependency culture, headed by a sprawling, sclerotic state machine.The only sure foundation on which to build a lasting recovery is by the wealth creation of the private sector.In practice that means the Government’s priority must be to encourage commerce and competition, not to dish out subsidies.So businesses should be urged to re-open as soon as possible, backed up by reductions in corporation tax and rates.Barriers to growth, like the strict social distancing limits, should be lted.At the same time, the Government should drop its plans to impose heavy-handed rules on quarantine for all travellers to Britain.It is a policy that will do nothing to protect public health but will cause huge damage to the economy, especially the travel industry.Similarly, Britain’s highly flexible labour market — the engine of the job creation miracle since  — must be maintained in the face of demands for more regulations.The best support that the Government can provide is not bailouts and bureaucracy, but a dynamic business environment along with a strong civic infrastructure, including modernised transport links and improved broadband.Soon after he became Prime Minister in , Jim Callaghan said: “We used to think we could spend our way out of recession. I tell you in all candour, that option no longer exists.”Under siege from inflation and the unions, his government was unable to abide by those sensible words.But as we come out of lockdown, their truth is more important than ever.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The NHS also removed ibuprofen as a suggested treatment for mild cases. But, a subsequent study suggested the drug did not worsen or improve patients conditions.Now, a team of scientists in London are starting a new clinical trial to seethe anti-inflammatory could in fact help speed up the recovery in some patients by reducing serious side effects.Its hoped a special formulation of the drug - not the standard painkiller - could lead to shorter hospital stays and fewer people ending up in intensive care units .Animal studies have shown that the treatment can increase survival rates by  per cent.Prof Mitul Mehta, whos leading the trial at Kings College London, told PA: This is very promising, but of course it is an animal study, so we want to translate that really compelling result into humans.Its a trial for patients with Covid- disease to seegiving them an anti-inflammatory drug - a specic form of ibuprofen - will reduce the respiratory problems they have.Prof Mehta stressed that the trial was for patients already in hospital, not those with mild or suspected Covid-.Volunteers will be selected from patients who are in hospital, but that are not so ill they need intensive care.Prof Mehta said: If we can reduce their symptoms at that stage we have a number of benefits. We could reduce the amount of time someone spends in hospital - they might recover quicker and go home, thats obviously a fantastic outcome.We also might be reduce the degree of respiratory distress so that it can be managed in the hospital setting, without needing to go to ICU, and thats a fantastic outcome as well.Theoretically, this treatment, given at this time, should be beneficial.But, of course, this is based on animal studies. Its based on case reports, we need to do a trial to show that the evidence actually matches what we expect to happen.The Liberate trial is being carried out at KCL as well as Guys and St Thomass NHS Foundation Trust, along with the pharmaceutical organisation, the SEEK Group.Prof Richard Beale, a consultant in intensive care medicine, at Guys and St Thomass, said: As a new illness, there are limited treatment options for patients with Covid-.The clinical trial will assess whether this unique formulation of an established drug benefits patients.Half of the patients taking part will be given standard care, while the other half will receive standard care as well as the special ibuprofen formulation.Prof Matthew Hotopf, director of the NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, said: This highly innovative therapeutic approach seeks to rapidly advance a potentially important new treatment.If successful, the global public health value of this trial would be immense given the low cost and availability of this medicine.Earlier this year, at the start of the pandemic, there was some controversy over the use of ibuprofen after a French health minister advised against using it.Scientists in the UK launched a review and the NHS removed the drug as a recommended treatment for mild cases. But the findings showed ibuprofen does not make Covid infections better or worse.The Commission on Human Medicines expert working group concluded: There is currently insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen and susceptibility to contracting Covid- or the worsening of symptoms. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Britain has been very good at it.But as we slowly move out of lockdown with thoughts of shopping, seeing our friends and family, and a cool drink in a pub garden, how effective this two-metre rule actually is has become a new national obsession.Many are starting to ask: Do we really need to keep a two-metre gap  Could it in fact be ONE metre  It may sound trivial, a metre is still too far to hug, kiss, even to shake hands with friends and loved ones.But for many businesses which rely on allowing people to gather more closely — theatres, restaurants, pubs, to name but a few — cutting the official social distance in half could be the dference between keeping afloat or going under.The official advice of the World Health Organization is that one metre is sufficient, a belief shared by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The Danes changed their position three weeks ago to one metre and most of the European countries’ public health officials advise one metre in certain circumstances.Now a new study by the WHO has found that while a two-metre distance reduced the risk of the virus being passed on to . per cent, a one-metre gap only increased the chance of transmission to . per cent.So a small risk either way, but enough to justy potentially endangering some of the industries we both enjoy and, for many thousands, rely upon for work. I have been asking for a couple of months how that distance was established, yet its origins are very obscure.It seems to go back to research on the distance between beds in the old-fashioned Nightingale wards in the s. It has become a folklore of infection control and public health, until people have started asking questions about it today.Experiments about the distance droplets travel have been conducted under such articial conditions that they are not applicable to everyday lives.Laboratory air is articially still, whereas air is not still, even when you are sitting in a room with all the windows and doors closed. Air flow breaks up the particles from a sneeze or a cough and they tend to fall pretty quickly on to your clothes or face.The serious risk of infection is when you get up to half a metre away from somebody with Covid- who sneezes or coughs.But the dference between one metre and two metres is the dference between a very small risk and a very tiny risk.To the economy, the dference is a radical one. Shting from two metres to one metre would allow us to get back to something close to business as usual. If you imagine a two-metre circle drawn around any inidual, that takes up  and a half square metres.When you come down to a one-metre safe zone, it is only . square metres. So you could get four times as many people into any given space. With the two-metre rule,  per cent of pubs and bars say it wouldn’t be economically viable to reopen. With four times as many customers, only small pubs would face dficulties.The current approach doesn’t grasp that town centres are leisure destinations and that people won’t go outit is an unpleasant experience. Shoppers want to have a coffee, lunch, try on clothes, it is a social activity with their friends.I believe that cinemas are safe to reopen and that perhaps we might be able to allow some fans back into football stadiums to cheer on their teams again.In a typical cinema, where seating is tiered and there is air conditioning,you do happen to be coughing out, the thermal heat from the bodies should rise it up out into the air conditioning system.Allowing fans to attend football matches again would be a challenge, because of the congestion going into the stadium.They would have to carefully plan entrance and exit times and leave every other seat vacant unless there is a family group, so you would probably be playing in front of a stadium which is  per cent full.I may be part of a faction that favours one metre, but the consensus is that the risk of transmission outside is very low.So joggers don’t have to go into the road to avoid getting too close to someone  on the pavement — because their slipstream will mean the droplets will probably stick to them anyway.The best way to reduce the risk of the virus spreading is a good standard of hygiene, sanitising your hands at the end of a journey and after eating.If you are involved in a lot of customer interactions, such as supermarket checkouts, Perspex barriers are helpful.The Government has taken so much flak on easing lockdown restrictions that they seem to be reluctant to get into a fight on this one. But we need to remember that interrupting the transmission of the virus is not about rules and their enforcement.It is about assessing the risk at each inidual venue, because sticking to two metres in all cases poses a risk to our economic health.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think that’s just the nature of the beast.”Downing Street said it was not willing to compromise Britains interest.A spokesman for Downing Street said: We have always been clear there is no question of splitting the dference on fish.We aren’t compromising because our position is fundamental to an independent country.Mr Deas said any attempt by the EU to block a free-trade deals to gain ground on fishing would be a nuclear option that would damage both sides.He added:would be extremely damaging to the EU as well as to the UK, that’s why I think there will be a compromise."},{"url":null,"title":"dad mcdonalds camped drive thru","story":"Rik Dove, , pitched his tent outside the fast food joint in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts., on Sunday night hoping hed be the first customer on Monday morning.The dad-of-five is seen smiling in a tiny pink tent in the drive-thru lane, with a childs plastic car in front of him as his vehicle.But Riks hopes were crushed when he was told he had the date the wrong and the restaurant doesnt actually open until Thursday.McDonalds plans to reopen  of its drive-thrus between from June  to June  - meaning Rik has to wait a little longer to get his burger.Rik said: I got moved on not long after I got there.

or whether shes dead or alive - remains a mystery.Madeleine vanished  years ago on May , , when her family, from Leicestershire, were holidaying in Praia da Luz, in the Algarve, Portugal.Parents Gerry and Kate left their three children – including toddler twins Sean and Amelie – sleeping in their apartment while they dined at a tapas bar -  metres away.When Kate ed to check on the kids at around pm that evening, she discovered that Madeleine was not in her bed and was missing.In September of that year, Gerry and Kate, both doctors, were sensationally named as ‘arguidos’ by Portuguese police.The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.Madeleine would have turned  on on May , .In April , UK cops released a computer generated image of Madeleine showing what she would look like aged nine.However, parents have said new images of Madeleines age progression are bogus. Kate and Gerry are warning the new fake images were neither commissioned nor endorsed by them or Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange team.A number of potential leads have emerged since the little girl vanished, but none amounted to anything and no arrests have ever been made.In May , witness Jane Tanner said Gerry had played tennis with a man wrongly identied as her abductor on the day she went missing.She said she spent up to half an hour watching Gerry McCann and Dr Julian Totman, , play on May , .Less than three hours later, she saw a man carrying a child in pyjamas near the McCanns’ apartment in Praia da Luz.But she did not recognise Dr Totman and cops pursued the lead for four years, despite the GP saying it was probably him.There have been more than , potential sightings of the Brit three-year-old since her disappearance, but police have so far failed to locate her.politan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there are signicant investigative avenues that are of great interest to both the UK and Portuguese teams pursuing the case.Met cops believe she was stolen by child traffickers or sex fiends, or during a burglary gone wrong.Meanwhile, cops are now hunting a person of signicance in a shock new development.A source close to Scotland Yards search Operation Grange said the person is now a critical line of inquiry in the £million investigation, according to The Times.And a former Met police chief has called for a fresh interview with Madeleines parents and the Tapas Seven - who have never been quizzed by British cops.Cops moved the search to Bulgaria as they tried to find a woman in purple they wanted to speak to.On May , , it emerged that Portuguese police were hunting a sex fiend who speaks English and wears a surgical mask in relation to Madeleines suspected kidnapping.In one of his previous cases, he broke into a British familys home and loomed over a seven-year-old girl who woke up and asked Is that you Daddy  and he replied Yes in a foreign accent, author Anthony Summers said in the Netflix doc.Detectives have discovered a creep carried out nearly  attacks within a -mile radius of the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz where Madeleine vanished from  years ago.He crept into Algarve properties rented by families and many victims were British.And a judicial source is reported to have confirmed the unnamed man was definitely in Portugal at the time the three-year-old suddenly disappeared.And the insider also alleged he was known to local cops and had previously been investigated on suspicion of involvement in paedophile cases.A chilling reconstruction features in the final episode of Netflixs eight-part documentary The Disappearance Of Madeleine McCann.A German paedophile Martin Ney, , emerged as a key suspect in May .He was jailed for le in  for abducting and murdering three children and sexually abusing dozens more.It is believed he was in Portugal when Madeleine went missing.Goncalo Amaral, the Portuguese cop who first led the hunt for Madeleine, revealed that police were probing a “German paedophile who is in prison”.Ney was working for an evangelical church on a project for the homeless in Portugal when Madeleine disappeared, its claimed.Ney also looks like a photofit of a man, who was seen acting suspiciously before Madeleine vanished from her Portuguese holiday apartment  years ago.Funding for the search was due to expire in October .But on September , , it was confirmed investigators have received £, to keep the probe alive until March .Then more funding - said to be around £, - was granted in March .The extra cash for Operation Grange is being used to investigate signicant leads, which Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley described as very worthwhile.Kate and and Gerry are “extremely thankful to both the Home Office and Scotland Yard for the continued funding,” their spokesman Clarence Mitchell said.The Home Office announced it was ploughing more money into Operation Grange, the official investigation, at the latest request of Met Police.In June  it was confirmed that the politan Police were asking the Home Office for more funding to continue the work of Operation Grange.Scotland Yards investigation has been ongoing since .During that time the number of detectives working on the case was cut from  to four in .The Home Office said in June  that the previous year saw it provide “£, of funding to the MPS. “The cost of Operation Grange to date is £.m.”Those still involved with the investigation are now said to spend a lot of their time eliminating known sex offenders and chasing down potential witnesses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But now there’s light at the end of the tunnel, as some children begin toto school from this week. Schools have remained open to support vulnerable children and key workers’ kids, but now nursery and reception plus years  and  are getting ready to go back too. Secondary schools will also offer some face-to-face support to pupils in years  and  as they prepare for their exams next year. As any parent knows, telling younger children to stay two metres apart will be a challenge, so it’s recommended that they only mix in the same small groups each day.  Andrea Parker is lead head teacher of three London primary schools, Bonneville, Jessop and Stockwell. She explains how a “bubbles” system will work: “There will be a maximum of  children in class. In our reception classes, we’ve got around eight children in each bubble. And it’s not just about the size of the bubble, it’s about the dynamics of the bubble as well. Children are people. “We’re going to really use more of our outdoor space for reception in particular, where they will be working in smaller groups. We’ll be removing all soft furnishings, and with things like the climbing frames only one bubble can use it at any one time and then it will be cleaned down before another bubble can use it.”  Staggering the drop-off and pick-up times is important to keep children and their carers safe – and schools are putting a new system into place. “We’ve got lines painted at the entrance a two-metre distance from the boundary of the school for drop-off,” says Ms Parker. “The bubble lead will be there for  minutes, and will then take her group through a marked route to their room. And then there’ll be  minutes after that for parents to leave the streets and to wait for any late children that might come here afterwards.

Luke Hall raised the half-baked idea in a letter to council chiefs, urging them to consider all options for supporting homeless people in the pandemic.More than , rough sleepers were offered emergency accommodation as coronavirus unfolded, including in hotels, as part of a scheme called aposEveryone Inapos.Mr Hall has now given English councils until June  to produce a next steps plan of where people should be housed. He wrote to town hall chief executives on May : In terms of move-on accommodation, all options need to be considered. We ask that you seek to encourage people, where appropriate and possible, toto friends and family. The letter went on to advise councils to find as many sustainable move-on options for people as possible. This could include working with housing associations to supply more homes, supporting people to move into private rents, or short-term accommodation to stop people ing to the streets. But Shadow Housing Secretary Thangam Debbonaire slammed the letter - which came after the government pledged to end rough sleeping in the wake of Covid-. She said: This half-baked suggestion shows that this Government is already rowing back from that promise. “These comments smack of incompetence.  Luke Hall has shown a woeful lack of understanding about the complex reasons why so many people sleep rough in this country. If rough sleepers were able toto their friends and family, they would not be sleeping rough. They need somewhere safe to live and the support to make a go of it. “The Government should be working with councils to fulfil its commitment to end rough sleeping, not washing of its hands of the responsibility to house the homeless. Coronavirus rules make it illegal in England to stay overnight away from the place where you are living. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman insisted people wouldto friends or family only where appropriate and possible. He added: Our new rough sleeping taskforce has one overriding objective: to ensure as many people as possible who have been brought in off the streets in this pandemic do notto sleeping rough.

So they will have had sympathy for Keir Starmer today having to deal with a similarly irrational outburst of anger and frustration. On the very day Boris Johnson vowed to “take control”, the Prime Minister stood up in the Commons and promptly lost it. Like a lb gorilla asked to do long ision without a pen and paper, Mr Johnson grunted, stomped and slammed his fist on the despatch box. Detective Chief Inspector Starmer spent another episode of CSI Westminster applying gentle scrutiny to the government’s handling of the Coronavirus crisis. “I really do not see the point,” Johnson growled, “of his endless attacks on public trust and confidence. The suggestion that the Johnson should have a word with his friend Donald about the horrendous, heavy handed policing of Black Lives Matter protests was met with more grumping. “I perfectly understand people’s right to protest what took place,” he said, like a man who had never spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on illegal anti-protest water cannons. Questioned on his plan to force MPs toen masse to Parliament - a building singularly unsuited to social distancing - was snootily dismissed. MPs should expect to come back to “do their jobs” - which now includes spending hours queuing up in a snaking round the creaky building’s grounds. It’s just like Disneyland, only the mice running across the canteen floor don’t wear trousers and white gloves. Meanwhile, scores of disabled, elderly and shielded Parliamentarians - not to mention thousands of members of the public who’ve been working from home - will question whether the PM thinks they’ve been sitting with their feet up since March.  Surely due for his trenchcoat and cigar any day now, Starmer asked why the PM’s promised “world beating” test and trace system was still missing key elements. He asked why lockdown was being eased before the PM’s own alert level said it should. And he asked why Johnson had failed to reply to a letter from Starmer offering support with plans to re-open schools. But answers there came none and Johnson tossed his Captain Calamari out of the pram, thumping his fists and accusing Starmer of undermining the public’s confidence in him.

Experts have admitted that the killer bug may have been imported from the beginning of December . Recordings from a meeting on January  has emerged that shows the World Health Organisation was struggling to obtain information from China during the crucial early days of the pandemic.WHO officials said China was withholding vital information needed to evaluate the risk of the virus to the rest of the world, Sun Online reports.On January  China finally admitted the virus was contagious and  days later WHO declared Covid- as a global emergency. If China was hiding the true date of the first infection, experts believe the virus may have entered the UK in December.Public Health England previously said it couldnapost dismiss the theory that coronavirus was in the UK in December or early January.Data gathered through the Covid- symptom-tracking app developed at King’s College London also indicates that people in the UK were contracting coronavirus from the start of January. Epidemiologist professor Tim Spector said: The reports I am getting are from people who were ill from early January onwards and strongly suggest they had Covid- but were not recognised as such.  The first confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK were recorded on January  when two Chinese nationals staying in a hotel in York tested positive. Steve Walsh was the first Brit to test positive on February . The businessman had attended a sales conference in Singapore in January. Recently it was revealed a man treated for suspected pneumonia in a hospital near Paris on December  had tested positive for the deadly bug.  This has raised the possibility that coronavirus was imported into Europe sooner than previously believed. Dr Stephen Baker, from Cambridge Universityaposs Infectious Diseases Institute, told the : Letaposs say it was kicking off fairly substantially in Wuhan and people werenapost being informed: could there have been people travelling to and from China at that point who may have been infected by coronavirus  That is completely possible. Is it then possible that they transmitted the virus to other people when they were in the UK  Yes, of course thataposs possible. Catherine Mayer fears her late husband, Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill, may have been killed by the virus after he ed home from touring in Asia in November.  The -year-old, who had been receiving treatment for the inflammatory condition sarcoidosis since , fell ill in January and died of pneumonia on February .

Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise, and the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.

The body of schoolboy Adam Kay was found in the River Irwell on Tuesday following a huge search operation. He was last seen in the water near Clton Country Park in Manchester on June .  The park was evacuated and a huge search operation got underway at around .pm. Witnesses told Manchester Evening News they saw at least  response vehicles and a helicopter at the scene. His body was found by underwater search teams a short while later. The tragic incident has since sparked an outpouring of grief for the teenager, who was a pupil at Harper Green School in Bolton.  Kellie Thygesen said: “I really wish this wasn’t true. Sleep well your dad will keep you safe now. We will all miss you. Love you my baby nephew.” Jessica Kay said: “love u million ur with dad now... “...heartbroken isnapost the word I shouldnapost be saying good bye to u.”  Leon Murphy Hayes said: “Rest in peace Adam. Thoughts are with you and your family.” A number of teachers from Harper Green School have since paid tribute to Adam, describing him as a “charismatic inidual” who “always had a smile on his face”. Headteacher, Stephen Gribbon, said: “Adam only joined our school this year but he very soon became popular due to his kind nature. “Adam always had a smile on his face and his boundless energy was infectious. In school Adam was always laughing and joking with his friends and had time for everyone. “Adam’s innate ability to befriend anyone that had the pleasure to meet him meant that people liked being around him and the loss of such a young and charismatic inidual will affect so many people. “My thoughts are with Adam’s family and friends and I offer the support of all the Harper Green community at this incredibly sad time.” Deputy Headteacher, Sally Heppenstall, said: “Even though he had only been at Harper Green School a short period of time, Adam very quickly became a valued and well liked member of our school community.  “I will remember him for his infectious laugh. He would spend breaks and lunch-times on the yard and in the year team with his close group of friends laughing and joking around. “His laugh was infectious. He was a loyal friend whose tragic passing will affect so many. My thoughts are with his family and friends.

The countryaposs education minster, Kirsty Williams, said a four-week term ending on July  would give pupils, staff and parents time to prepare for a new normal when the next academic year begins in September. Today she said a phased approach would see staggered starts, lessons, and breaks for dferent year groups, with a third of pupils at most in school at any time. Under the plans, teachers will also be given priority for antibody testing. My announcement today gives schools three-and-a-half weeks to continue preparing for the next phase, she said. We will use the last weeks of the summer term to make sure pupils, staff and parents are prepared - mentally, emotionally and practically - for the new normal in September. June  means there will have been one full month of test, trace and protect, which will continue to expand. I can also announce that teachers will be a priority group in our new antibody-testing programme. As we continue to keep Wales safe, this approach will be critical.The evolving science suggests that warm weather and sunlight gives us the best opportunity to ensure more time in school.Waiting until September would mean almost half a year without schooling. That would be to the detriment to the wellbeing, learning progress and mental health of our young people.

The measures could include social distancing, school closures, shielding by the elderly and vulnerable, and self-isolating at home, the study said. It comes as the Governement gradually eases lockdown restrictions in England after  weeks amid fresh signs that more Britons are ignoring social distancing rules.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. Confirmed cases and deaths have been trending downwards since late April, but there are fears that the UK will suffer a devastating second wave as the lockdown is relaxed.The study, carried out by the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Covid- working group and published in -X fulltext utm_campaigntlcoronavirusutm_content\" target\"_blank\" rel\"nofollow\"The Lancet medical journal, analysed the potential impact of dferent measures to control the spread of Covid-.The group includes John Edmunds, a member of the Governmentaposs Sage committee and a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It looked at four main control measures, or base interventions, that have already been imposed in the UK - school closures, social distancing, the shielding of the elderly and vulnerable, and self-isolation when people come down with symptoms. Using ious models, the researchers tried to predict the number of new cases over time, patients requiring intensive care treatment and deaths, and how the measures would influence the rate of infection, or R rate. With no control measures, the study projected  million cases and , deaths by December .  The toughest lockdown scenario resulted in a projected , cases and , deaths, according to the study. The authors wrote: Intensive interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability. The characteristics of SARS-CoV- mean that extreme measures are probably required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs. As of this week, more than , people have died from coronavirus, according to official figures based on death certicates mentioning Covid-.Britain has the worst death toll in Europe and the second highest total in the world, behind only the US. The four base interventions were each likely to reduce the rate of infection, but not enough to prevent hospital intensive care units from being overwhelmed.

Star Wars actor John Boyega gave an emotional speech - describing demonstrators as a physical representation of our support for George Floyd. The event was organised following the shocking killing of Mr Floyd, who died after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was filmed pressing down on his neck with his knee. The footage has sparked outrage around the world. Todayaposs protest in Lonon moved from Hyde Park as crowds walked towards Downing Street via Victoria Station.At Victoria, demonstrators hung a sign reading justice for Belly Mujinga, including members of the rail workeraposs family. Belly Mujinga was a rail worker who died from coronavirus after being spat at while on duty at the London station by a man who said he had COVID-. Many held banners saying I canapost breathe - the words Mr Floyd repeatedly told the officer shortly before he passed out. Others said the UK is not innocent and demanded justice in tackling racism.After leaving Hyde Park, hundreds headed south as they blocked off Park Lane Road, stopping traffic and at least  double decker buses.Many drivers stuck in traffic sounded their horns in time to chants from the crowd.As part of the protests today, actor Boyega referenced two other black Americans who controversially died in the US and the racist UK murder of Stephen Lawrence, as he told demonstrators: We are a physical representation of our support for George Floyd.  We are a physical representation of our support for Sandra Bland. We are a physical representation of our support for Trayvon Martin. We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence. He added: Iaposm speaking to you from my heart. Look, I donapost knowIaposm going to have a career after this, but f*** that.

US President Donald Trump has come under fire for threatening to bring in the military to tackle disorder after curfews were imposed in cities across the country following eight days of protests. Today Boris Johnson was pressed on why he had stayed silent - before he finally voiced his condemnation. Protesters were urged by campaigners behind the rally to stick to social distancing rules. Organiser Naomi Smith, , told the Evening Standard: “It’s important that we do this in London to show solidarity.  We will keep to the social distance rules and this is a peaceful demonstration.” Todayaposs rally comes after a protest march on Sunday in Central London, with gatherings also held in cities across the UK, including Liverpool and Manchester. Earlier today the Prime Minister was grilled about his response to the crisis, amid calls for him to condemn Trumpaposs heavy handed approach. In answer to a question from Labour leader Keir Starmer, Mr Johnson replied: I think what happened in the United States was appalling, it was inexcusable, we all saw it on our screens and I perfectly understand peopleaposs right to protest what took place. Though obviously I also believe that protest should take place in a lawful and reasonable way.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said: I am surprised the Prime Minister hasnapost said anything about this yet. I do hope that next time he speaks to President Trump he will convey to him the UKaposs abhorrence about his response to the events.

Amy Louise Thorpe, from the South Island city of Invercargill, was addicted to the popular fizzy drink, he told a coroner holding an inquest into her death. The mum-of-three died of an epileptic seizure two years ago. Her consumption of the caffeine-laden beverages were considered as potential factors in the hearing probing her death, reports Stuff. The inquest was told the young woman drank two litres of Coke almost every day, and additionally consumed up to a litre of energy drinks daily too. She was found unresponsive in her Invercargill home on December, , . Findings delivered this week say her soft drink consumption may have contributed to her death. Samples of Ms Thorpeaposs blood and urine analysed after her death reportedly uncovered the presence of caffeine and nicotine. A report released by Coroner David Robinson said she smoked around  gramsof tobacco a week. He noted she had a history of epilepsy and was up to date with her medication, but her most recent seizure had been just three days before her death. Ms Thorpe also suffered from depression, anxiety and sleep apnoea, the report said. Mr Robinsonaposs report said she had a raised body-mass index and a history of gestational diabetes.  Ms Thorpeaposs partner described her as being addicted to Coca-Cola. He told police his partner consumed advising police consumed on average two litres a day, along with around ml to litre of Mother branded energy drink a day. A friend, Madonna Bresolini-Meikle​ provided a statement to police. According to Stuff she said: Amy had more energy drinks a day than people have coffee. She enjoyed her V drinks and Coke. The coroner considering her death referenced research linking high caffeine energy drinks to seizures in adults. A neurologist consulted for the inquest added that research on the phenomenon was ided and described the data as lacking. He said some studies suggesting caffeine intake could increase seizure susceptibility, while others found it could potentially protect against them. However caffeine was also shown to inhibit anti-seizure drugs commonly used to manage epilepsy, such as Topiramate, he added.  Dr Graeme Hammond-Tooke​ said: In the case of Ms Thorpe, I think it is possible that excessive caffeine contributed to poor seizure control. While modest intake of caffeine contained in drinks is not likely to affect seizure control, large amounts probably do increase seizures, and may have other adverse effects on health. The coroner encouraged the case to be publicised, saying people with epilepsy and doctors advising them should should be made aware of potential consequences from using too much caffeine. A tribute page for Ms Thorpe described her as a aposmuch-lovedapos mum-of-three and partner. Her case bore similarities to another death in the same city in . A coroner found Invercargill mum-of-eight Natasha Harrisapos death was also linked to excessive Coke consumption after she drank up to eight litres a day for several years before she died. At the time, Coca Cola denied its product played any proven role in the -year-old womanaposs death.  Meanwhile, the UK is banning the sale of energy drinks to children following a campaign backed by teachers unions and stars including celebrity chef and sugar-tax advocate Jamie Oliver.

They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

alternatives to a refund, such as a credit note, in the event of cancelled bookings, it is a customerrsquos legal right to be given the option of a full cash refund.However, only five per cent of Ryanair customers surveyed by Which  have reported receiving their money within this time frame.Almost  per cent of Ryanair customers are still waiting to be refunded.This is in stark contrast to rival airline Jet, with only  per cent of customers still awaiting a refund, and  per cent of customers at British Airways.Refunds are also slowly being processed by easyJet, with  per cent of customers still waiting to get their money back.Do I have to accept a voucher Ryanair has come under fire for confusing customers with its numerous changes in approach to refunds and vouchers.The airline initially told customers it was processing refunds at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, although many reported that the refund forms did not work.Ryanair then attempted to force vouchers on passengers who had specically requested a refund, and suggested that customers may have to wait as long as  months before getting their money back, according to Which .What has the Civil Aviation Authority said In May, the Civil Aviation Authority warned airlines that the law was clear and customers must be granted a refundthey request it, rather than being offered a voucher or credit note.The CAA said: ldquoUnder the law, consumers are entitled to receive a refund for their cancelled flights.ldquoDespite the challenges the industry is currently facing [...] it is important that consumers are given a clear option to request a cash refund without unnecessary barriers.In a statement, Ryanair said it would offer refunds, but customers may have to wait until the coronavirus crisis is over.The airline said: ldquoThe process time for cash refunds is taking longer due to the fact we are having to process , times the usual volume of cancellations and have fewer staff available due to social distancing measures.ldquoCustomers who choose not to accept a free [booking] move or voucher will be refunded in due course, once this unprecedented crisis is over.How can I

Scotland, however First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advised protesters to avoid large groups.Ms Sturgeon backed the Black Lives Matter movement, saying she sympathised with those looking to protest, but warned of the risks involved with gathering due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.She said: \"Right now, it is the case, unfortunately, and regrettably, that large gatherings of people could pose a risk to health and indeed to le.\"Unfortunately, thats the case whether it is a peaceful protest or a football match or any other gathering where people are coming together in close proximity.\"What I would say to those who want to protest, and I say this as an ally and supporter, is that we need to find ways of allowing people to make their voices heard and to make the points that many of us want to be made and to be heard right now but to do so in a way that is safe and is not putting people protesting or wider communities at

These allow vets to make the best diagnosis possible and give advice or treatment whichever is required.Medications and prescriptions can be collected from the Tranent surgery or posted or delivered via courier to clients.Reception staff are extremely busy as they have to determine which category the phone call falls into. There is no such thing as making a basic appointment now. Everything takes much longer to discuss and consequently sometimes the telephone system is overwhelmed.You can, of course, leave a message or send an email, contact websites or Facebook pages. Someone will respond to your question as soon as possible. The reception team are doing a wonderful job, as of course they are at all veterinary practices. They are our frontline heroes who deserve special applause.At Dunedin Vets, we are now seeing more emergency cases after triage.Dogs and cats who are now almost three months overdue their boosters can now have them. This will prevent them having to restart their vaccine course and means their owners only having to visit the practice once.All pups and kittens who had first vaccines before lockdown should have had their second vaccines now. Pups can start vaccine courses as long as they have been in their new home for at least one week, are over ten weeks old and their owners are not self- isolating.We are trying to delay kittensrsquo vaccinations as long as possible ndash especiallythey are not going out.We will try to do one vaccine at neutering time, to reduce the number of visits. If your rabbit is due boosters just now, as many rabbits are, prior to going outdoors, both vaccines can be given at the same time rather than two weeks apart ndash again reducing the number of outings to the surgery. Clients are not allowed in the surgery, having smaller animals in cages and dogs on leads helps in the handover of pets.I am sure all veterinary practices have been thinking about when we can have clients back in the surgery.At Dunedin Vets, we will have safety shields on reception desks and distancing stickers as well as hazard tape on the floor. Staff will be wearing masks and visors and there will be a limit to the numbers of clients allowed in the surgery at any one time.Hopefully we can open our other branches and have all our staff back at work soon. Until then we continue doing as we are doing and keeping everyone safe.During this period of lockdown there have been some ongoing cases which have required regular treatment, examinations and blood tests. These include diabetics, dogs with Addisonrsquos or Cushingrsquos conditions and cats with blood pressure and thyroid problems as well as those with heart conditions.One patient who had to be seen throughout this time is Buri.Buri is a four-year-old German Shepherd dog belonging to Mrs Sarah McHale and family who visit our Dunbar surgery.In November , Buri was seen at Dunbar with an apparent urinary tract infection. He had been drinking more and going to the toilet lots. When examined, he was a fit, lively dog, but had several large lymph nodes under his neck.Rhiannon the vet took a sample from the glands which I examined under the microscope. I found some large, unusual cells. Buri came for a biopsy under anaesthetic.The samples were sent to a laboratory for testing and unfortunately the results were not good. Buri had lymphoma, a cancer of blood cells which results in enlargement of lymph nodes. This is a form of cancer which we can treat in practice with chemotherapy.The particular type of lymphoma Buri had would respond better to a drug he needed to have at Edinburgh Vet School. So for the next five months, every week Buri attended either our Tranent branch for one type of chemotherapy and sometimes to the Vet School at Penicuik for the other.He had to take tablets every day as well. He had numerous blood tests to check his blood count and to check all his organs were ing well. He also had urine samples checked to make sure no problem was developing.He was such a good lad. He had to be away from his family when the chemotherapy was being administered.Vet Jonny and nurse Fiona, dressed in their chemotherapy PPE, became his best friends. He seemed to love coming to the surgery bouncing about and wanting to play with everyone.He responded very well to his treatment. His lymph nodes reduced rapidly. He remained happy and healthy, eating well and had very few side effects from the chemotherapy. The weeks wore on and Buri became a regular at the surgery, usually on a Tuesday afternoon, when all the staff looked out for him.When lockdown came, we received a message from the Vet School that they were unable to carry out further chemotherapy treatments.Buri was at the end of his treatment there.We continued to give him his chemotherapy for three more weeks, when on April , he received his very last dose.He was still the happy boy we adored. We decided to ring that final chemo bell and give him a round of applause which he justly deserved.His mum had to stay at home self- isolating but we shared a video and photos with her, which she loved.She was happy for us to spread the good news and our Facebook video post went viral.No doubt Buri will have ups and downs and may require further treatment but we wish Buri and his family every good wish for the future.Stay safe everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"column-qmus-important-research-role","story":"NICOLA Sturgeon has now released the Scottish Governmentrsquos lsquoroute maprsquo for leading us through the Covid- crisis, which is available for everyone to read on the Scottish Governmentrsquos website.As of today , we will begin to work through the phases of our gradual emergence out of lockdown.Whilst we all want to get back to normality, it is important that we strike a balance between protecting the publicrsquos health but also in allowing people to have inidual freedoms.In phase one, you will be able to meet with one other household at a two-metre distance, as long as it is outside, and many outdoor sports such as golf and tennis will be permitted.The overall message remains: stay as home as much as we can, to avoid a second wave.I would like to congratulate Queen Margaret University on being awarded pound, from the Scottish Government to support it in rapid coronavirus research.This will be sure to play a signicant role across Scotland in understanding the effect that the virus will have.Research such as this is fundamentally important in developing policies and treatment for Covid- and this will undoubtedly contribute to saving lives.To commend this good news, I have submitted a congratulatory motion to my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament and I hope this will be well supported by them.I would like to thank QMU for undertaking this work, and wish the researchers working in this area all the best.I would like to thank community councils for all their work in supporting the local area through this challenging time.I know that many have been making efforts to ensure people have access to food, prescriptions and also emotional support.Our community councils often make huge dferences in our community but receive little recognition for their hard work."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-aberlady-gifford-haddington-athelstaneford-longniddry-macmerry-gladsmuir-ormiston","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at six of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Aberlady.

But it will remain for some time I suspect.My thoughts on the beach the other day drted to my older kids, who I have been unable to see because they are on the other side of that invisible fence.Then I remembered a scene in a novel I read when I was at high school.The novel was Lord of the Flies by William Golding.It left a deep impression on me at the time.The story is about a group of boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island after an airplane crash.They are without any adults, and so they must organise and govern themselves in order to survive.At first they do this by having rules and symbols of authority that everyone respects.One of the boys finds a conchand itrsquos used to give democratic order to discussions.A boy called Ralph tries to maintain this semblance of order and fairness, but it all starts to break down.Gradually, the modes of behaviour they learnt in society before the crash erode, as some of the boys realise they can now do what they want.The scene from the novel which I remembered describes how one of the older boys, called Roger, throws stones close to a younger boy named Henry, who is playing on the beach.He wants to hit him, but he doesnrsquot.Golding explains why: ldquoRoger gathered a handful of stones and began to throw them.ldquoYet there was a space round Henry, perhaps six yards in diameter, into which he dare not throw.ldquoHere, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old le. Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law.Later of course, Roger finally rejects these taboos of the old le, and actually kills another boy with a rock.By this time, the new society created by the boys on the island has become cruel and despotic.The conch has been smashed and a boy called Jack has become a power crazed leader, ruling with terror.At its core, the novelrsquos message is a very pessimistic one that when the constraints imposed by commonly agreed standards of behaviour and humanitarian respect are removed, people will descend into uncaring and savage norms of behaviour, led by power crazed rulers.The novel was criticised for this pessimism, but of course there are many examples in history, and in current times, of despotic cruel regimes and societies.But my thoughts on this, as I played with my younger kids on the beach, were that there are more good folk in this world whose collective will has made those boundaries and keep them in place.I see it all around me people in communities creating norms of kindness, consideration and care.Yes, therersquos rudeness, selfishness and aggression too, but every smile, every kind act, every respectful exchange dilutes them and helps shore up the norms of a caring society.That protective invisible fence we currently have around ourselves is a product of our care for others as well as for ourselves.What gives it strength is not so much enforcement, but the understanding that for the benefit of others we sometimes canrsquot, or shouldnrsquot, just do what we want.Integrity and honesty are the cornerstones of this.We can disagree on objectives and priorities, but without these values our conch is broken.I have had some discussions with my youngest daughter recently about the importance of owning your actions and taking responsibility. Shersquos six and she gets it.These were my thoughts as I walked the Pans shore with my youngest kids.But I was thankfully taken out of them by my wee boy, who is currently obsessed with King Kong.He asked me: ldquoIs that island over there where King Kong lives "},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-communities-cockenzie-port-seton-humbie-east-west-saltoun-bolton-musselburgh-prestonpans-tranent-elphinstone","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port Seton.

This can lead to problems starting your car when it comes time to get back to work. Better keep those jump leads handy.Rustybrake discsA rusty brake disc can be a real problem.When your car is being usedregularly, your brake discs can take care of themselves - but when left standing for too long, they can rust.This happens when rain falls on your brake discs and is left to dry out.Normally any surface rust comes off through using your brakes the next time you drive, but when the cars off the road this doesnt happen and repeated soaking and drying can cause the rust to build up and badly damage the brake discs.Fortunately most of the country has enjoyed mostly dry weather during this lockdown so - butyou think your brakes arent working as they should, you need to get them checked out urgently.Flat tyresIm sure it wasnt like this when I parked it.If youve got a slow puncture, it can take quite a while before your tyre deflates enough to be noticeable. If you had one before you stopped driving, by now it could well be completely flat. Before setting out on your journey, check your tyre pressures to make sure theyre all still safe.Low oilOver a long period of a car not moving, oil can start draining down through the system into the sump.

The top priority to ensure more people cycle is dedicated, segregated cycling paths, separate from traffic.ldquoIncreasing access to bikes, places to store them and cycle training wherever required are the other measures to ensure even more people can enjoy cycling for essential journeys or exercise.Even with new cycle lanes, we have a lot of pedalling to do to catch up with some of our European cousins: in the Netherlands, % of journeys are by bike, while in Denmark the figure is %. Prior to lockdown, Britain managed just % of journeys by bike.And there are lingering concerns that the rise in cycling may be offset by people who would normally use public transport choosing to travel by car instead.ldquoTherersquos no doubt therersquos an increase in cyclists, but Irsquom not convinced itrsquos driven by anything more than leisure and keeping fit, he says. ldquoThere seems to be a big rush to change things when we donrsquot know what the new normal is.ldquoWhen people do go back to work, they will still be living in suburbs, theyrsquoll still work in dferent parts of the city, and still want to get around. Evenwe multiply cycling -fold, itrsquos not close to the amount of trips done by car.ldquoItrsquos taking a bit of a punt to hope that people will stick with bicycles.To do that, Tim Burns of Sustrans suggests there will have to be more than pop-up cycle routes.ldquoEven the most ambitious plans for walking and cycling from cities across the UK are unlikely to meet the needs of all people who formerly took public transport, he says.He suggests making mph the default speed in all urban and residential areas, removing VAT from cycle sales, more cycle parking, free cycle servicing, and the development of ldquopark and cycle facilities at park and ride hubs.ldquoStaggering sht patterns during the day and rotating shts during which people can come into the office will also be important, he adds.At home in Edinburgh, Scott Gammie ndash who, ironically, works in the car trade as a franchise principle at Lexus in Edinburgh and Glasgow ndash is certain the family will be more than just lockdown cyclists.ldquoWersquoll keep doing this, he says. ldquoMy we is now planning to cycle to work in the city centre.

Naturally, quite a few people then asked the obvious question: why,we value these workers so much, donrsquot we pay them more money, rather than just applauding them  This is a sentiment echoed by a new paper from the Jimmy Reid Foundation, which argues that the coronavirus has exposed failings in the economy.Professor Gregor Gall from the foundation declared that the pandemic has revealed that ldquoour economy and society are far too much based on money and markets, which makes them ldquofragile and ldquolacking in fairness. The proposals include paying public sector workersmore, a Universal Basic Income, increased spending on public transport, a ldquomore just tax system, making universities co-operatives ndash in short, familiar socialist priorities.This is a popular sentiment. Eighty other organisations, mostly on the Left, described the recovery from the coronavirus as ldquoa rare chance to markedly accelerate the repurposing of government away from economic growth and towards goals of wellbeing and sustainability, ending inequality and environmental destruction.Itrsquos interesting that their, and Prof Gallrsquos, solution to a society based too much on money and growth is to spend money ndash other peoplersquos money, presumably extracted from private firms and rich iniduals. Fair enough. Thatrsquos socialism, after all, and the only objection to it is that it has failed and made people poorer, less free and more miserable every single time it has been tried. What interests me more is that those who think in those terms criticise advocates of the market as being interested only in the bottom line, knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing, and so on, yet their prescriptions are drawn from a view of the world which sees things primarily in economic terms, and as a clash of class interests that must be regulated by the state. Again, not very surprising,you start with a book called Capital. This world view does exactly what Marx accused capitalism of doing: reducing people to objects.Yet thatrsquos the wrong way round. A free market demonstrates that just making money is not most peoplersquos main objective. Indeed, it is when societies are based on markets and growth ndash a group into which billions of people have moved over the past four or five decades ndash that iniduals have the freedom to enjoy leisure, provide welfare, and choose occupations and lestyles that they find personally fulfilling.Most of us will agree that people who work in the care sector do an extremely valuable and demanding job that is not well paid. Itrsquos also not very controversial to think of lots of jobs ndash directors of quangos, university vice-chancellors, television presenters, middle-managershellip take your pick ndash where far too much is being paid for something that lots of people could easily do. But many people ndash especially those in the health sector, or in teaching, or in charitable or certain types of political work ndash go into those fields because they find them rewarding in ways that have nothing to do with money.To be, for example, a research associate at the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Social and Political Sciences demands much more in the way of qualications, and has a higher status attached to it, than being an electrician. But an electrician may very well be better paid. That doesnrsquot make Prof Gall an idiot for not choosing to become an electrician, nor does it suggest that we should tax electricians more in order to bump up the salaries of university lecturers.Many people certainly do jobs that they donrsquot enjoy or ndash as farmers having trouble finding UK natives prepared to work on the harvest are discovering ndash wonrsquot do some work because itrsquos too demanding or unpleasant. But the market solution is either to find people from where who are prepared to or, where thatrsquos impossible, pay more in order to attract such workers.Some people do jobs they find dull because they pay well. Others work in poorly paid jobs that they enjoy, or that fit in around their family le . Most probably feel that they deserve more pay for the work they put in, unless theyrsquore stinking rich, in which case they tend to express the view that theyrsquore worth every penny.But, at least in the private sector, the monetary value of a job is a balance between how many people are capable of doing it, and willing to, and its cost to the business. That doesnrsquot mean that the value of a supermarket shelf-stacker, say, is solely measured in money ndash and we should all have realised how important it is to the rest of us. It is, however , not especially dficult to find people who can do it, and certainly easier than finding someone who can run the whole of Tesco and keep it in profit, so itrsquos not at all surprising that there should be a disparity in the wages.It would be nicethis crisis makes us appreciate some of the workers, often not well paid, upon whom we depend.

I refused to apologise and I refuse to this day to apologise.In a career noted for busting taboos on everything from sex to sectarianism, few of Connollyrsquos routines have caused more controversy. Connolly says the row led to his name being ldquoremoved from the books at his primary school, St Petersrsquo Girls and Infants, in Glasgow. Glass said at the time: ldquoIf the Forth was lava, I would throw him in.Connolly says the routine stemmed from a palrsquos joke. ldquoThe disciples were in a pub and they were eating Chinese takeaway. Jesus came in and said lsquoWhere did you get that rsquo One said, lsquoOh, Judas bought them, he seems to have come into some money.rsquo That was the joke. I thought it was hysterical. That night I told it on stage and I expanded on it.The routine featured in Connollyrsquos best-selling album, Billy Connolly Live. The resulting furore put his name in the papers, which led to his first booking on the BBC chat show, Parkinson, in . He never looked back.ldquoIt was the making of me, says Connolly of the sketch.In the documentary, part of a season celebrating Connollyrsquos career, the now -year-old discusses what he calls his ldquolelong love affair with sending up organised religion.ldquoReligion is re with comedy material and I canrsquot resist having a go at it.Born in Partick, Glasgow, in , Connolly says he believed in God in his early years.

I didnrsquot set out to do that but they take offence so easily. All yoursquove got to do is talk about them, what they do, and theyrsquoll find offence in it.Introducing religion into his routines was another way Connolly broke the mould. Once voted ldquothe comediansrsquo comedian in a poll of his peers, Connolly says the dference between him and traditional comics of the time was that they were happy to do racist, sexist, homophobic material, and he was not.ldquoYou didnrsquot speak about religion or politics. It was considered bad manners.Kevin McKenna, columnist for The Herald, says the Crucixion routine presented a lot of west of Scotland households with a dficult choice.ldquoYou had these parents who of course found it hilarious, but up and down the country priests were telling them, lsquoThatrsquos mocking the central tenet of our faith.

Pastor Glass and protesters are seen handing out a newsletter, Scottish Protestant View, denouncing Connolly. One banner calls the comedian a ldquoblasphemous buffoon. Another takes him to task for calling the crown of thorns ldquoa jaggy bunnet and describing Jesus in ldquoa drunken state.ldquoIf he makes a public apology we would be happy to end our campaign, says Glass.The preacher died in . According to Connolly, he could be menacing at times.ldquoHe became kind of evil, Jack. He would come up beside me and say, what would you doChrist was to judge you now  Crucy Christ again, he would say, and hand me three nails.Connolly, who was diagnosed with Parkinsonrsquos in , now lives in Florida. Just as his persona has shted from scourge of the church to beloved Sir Billy, so the film reveals his attitude towards religion softening.ldquoTherersquos a side of religion I really like. The side that comforts the lonely, that encourages art. It explained the world to a lot of people for a long time.

Itrsquos actually a very modest uplt with green roofs in terms of the initial capital cost.ldquoIn Edinburgh there are a few examples of some really nice green roofs but they tend to be part of office accommodation. More generally, and especially in terms of housing, they are not that common in Scotland - they are really quite rare.ldquoWe are hoping that construction firms, developers and the housing sector can see the benefits of incorporating this.

While many species canrsquot cope, some types of animal are especially good at living within cities.Red foxes are prevalent within several UK cities, including in Scotland, where they have become well-established.Dr Kevin Parsons, of the Institute of Bioersity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, said: ldquoWe wondered whether this change in lestyle was related to adaptive dferences between urban and rural populations of red foxes.ldquoWe assessed skulls from hundreds of foxes found within London and the surrounding countryside and saw that urban foxes had a smaller brain size capacity but also a dferent snout shape that would help them forage within urban habitats.ldquoThere was also less of a dference between males and females in urban foxes.The researchers - from the Universities of Glasgow, Bristol, Edinburgh and Massachusetts and National Museums Scotland , tested whether dferences found between urban and rural red foxes had any similarity to what is found across dferent species of foxes.Dr Parsons added: ldquoThis could tell us whether the evolution of urban rural dferences was completely unique or something that has potentially happened previously.ldquoIt turned out that the way urban and rural foxes dfered matched up with a pattern of fox evolution that has occurred over millions of years between species.ldquoWhile the amount of change isnrsquot as big, this showed that this recent evolutionary change in foxes is dependent upon deep-seated tendencies for how foxes can change.ldquoIn other words, these changes were not caused by random mutations having random effects the way many might think evolution occurs.The findings suggest that, while urban foxes are not domesticated, they are changing in ways that move them closer to what is seen in many domesticated animals.Dr. Andrew Kitchener from NMS, co-author of the study, said: ldquoThis is important because human-animal interactions are continuous and some of the basic environmental aspects that may have occurred during the initial phases of domestication for our current pets, like dogs and cats, were probably similar to the conditions in which our urban foxes and other urban animals are living today.\"So, adapting to le around humans actually primes some animals for domestication.The teamrsquos research paper, ldquoSkull morphology erges between urban and rural populations of red foxes mirroring patterns of domestication and macroevolution, is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society Series B."},{"url":null,"title":"evidence-5-000-year-old-neolithic-fabric-found-orkney","story":"Evidence of woven Neolithic textile has been confirmed at the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute research excavation at the Ness of Brodgar.Only one other such example has been found in Scotland.The archaeologists at the site do not physically have a piece of ,-year-old fabric, but the impression it leaves when pressed against the wet clay of a pot.Organic material from prehistory does not survive often unless in very specic oxygen-free conditions in the archaeological record, so the study of Neolithic textiles has to rely on secondary evidence.To date, there is only one other piece of evidence suggesting the use of woven textiles in Neolithic Scotland - another clay imprint discovered in  in Dumfries and Galloway.These exciting new discoveries have come to light during a project started in  at the Archaeology Institute of the University of the Highlands and Islands by Jan Blatchford and Roy Towers to closely examine impressions left on the surfaces of sherds of Grooved Ware pottery unearthed at the Ness.The project uses Reflectance Transformation Imaging- a technique that uses a photographic rig to take multiple photos of a subject, each with a dferently angled light source.These pictures are combined, using computer software, to create a highly detailed digital image of the surface of an object that can be examined from all angles and enlargements and examined on screen. The results reveal surface details not visible during normal examination.In this case, two co-joining sherds carry the imprint of a woven cloth. The impressions appear on the inner face of the vessel, suggesting they were made by the potterrsquos clothing during the potrsquos creation.These were first discovered by one of the Ness post-excavation volunteers, Lorraine Clay, who noted a clear impressed cord.She showed the sherds initially to Jan Blatchford and then Emma Smith, a regular at the Ness and a textile analysist and conservation specialist.Dr Susanna Harris, an expert in European prehistoric textiles, was able to give a second opinion on the RTI confirming the identication.This impression of a piece of Z-ply cord, around cm long and mm in diameter, is so clear it is possible to see the inidual fibres. Although the possibility of an additional textile impression was noted by Emma on initial viewing of the sherd, the ability to view the sherd under RTI has allowed this to be confirmed.The imprint appears to show finely woven cloth, but the impression is less defined than the cord, meaning details of the weaving technique used is dficult to ascertain - although the yarn used was probably plant-based, possibly flax.Within Neolithic Scotland textile finds are incredibly rare, and no other examples on Orkney. The one other documented example from Mainland Scotland was found at Flint Howe, Dumfries and Galloway. It consisted of a small impression of a plain-weave textile on the exterior of a Late Neolithic Early Bronze Age vessel.Ness of Brodgar Site Director Nick Card said, There is no evidence of textile tools available in Neolithic Orkney, suggesting textiles were made by hand, or using tools made with organic materials that have not survived in the archaeological record.ldquoThis lack of material culture around textile production can help us to infer what techniques they may have been using. The project is also revealing rare basketry and other cord impressions.ldquoA growing number of base sherds from the Ness have impressions of coiled mats used in the construction of clay vessels. These match examples found at Barnhouse and Rinyo in Orkney and also at Forest Road in Aberdeenshire. All specimens suggest fibre mats of spiral construction that may have eased the turning of the pot as it was formed and even facilitated its transportation whilst it was dried and then fired.Some body sherds have plied cord impressions on their exterior surfaces. Short s of plied cord impressions, known as lsquomaggotsrsquo, are often used as a decoration on some Neolithic pots but the irregular and unevenly impressed nature of the markings on the Ness examples may indicate that the marks are accidental.It may be that the pot was held in some form of basket whilst the clay was still wet. Further examination of the lsquomaggotsrsquo is ongoing. Cordage and textiles would have been essential in prehistory, facilitating essential survival activities such as hunting, fishing, foraging, storage, cooking and providing warm clothing, matting and bedding. The incredible survival of organic remains at the Bronze Age site of Must Farm, Cambridgeshire, highlights the prevalence and complexity of fibre technology in British prehistory.Work continues to document and interpret these impressions, which, it is hoped, will provide an invaluable insight into the fibre technology of the Neolithic.The Neolithic British Isles refers to the period of British, Irish and Manx history that spanned from circa  to circa , BC."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-cant-snp-treat-us-like-adults","story":"The SNP-led Scottish Government has lectured us for more than a decade about our eating, smoking and drinking habits, all to no avail for the most part.

The UK Government has already been extremely slow and dangerously lax in its approach to quarantining and health checks of the hundreds of thousands of arrivals to the UK during the pandemic. It has been out of step with other countries who have had public health measures in place at their airports and ports for months.ldquoDespite repeated calls from opposition politicians including myself and public health experts for measures to be taken, the UK has had no such protections in place. The Home Secretary has abjectly failed to take charge of this policy, implementing quarantining so late that it may have missed the point of its effectiveness, watering down her plans further undermines the basis of the policy change she has announced.ldquoWhen the Home Secretary comes before Parliament she must outline the scientic advice behind her decisions, and why the UK Government has moved so slowly and out of step with the international community.:Ian McConnell: Is it Tory instinct that is risking the ship for a haprsquoorth of tar on furlough scheme From Monday anyone arriving in the UK will have to quarantine in one place, and provide contact details of relatives in case they fall ill.

Funny though, the words Donald Trump never crossed his lips.As expected, Sir Keir picked up on a report that suggested our straw-haired premier was taking ldquodirect control of Governmentrsquos response to the virus and so asked, to Labour laughter, who had been in direct control thus far.The PM snfed and hit back, to noises of encouragement from the Tory benches, listing his Governmentrsquos achievements, like getting the death rate down, and once again insisted the publicrsquos ldquogood British common sense would see the country through.Then came Borisrsquos first level of irritation, telling the Labour leader: ldquoWhat the country would like to hear from him is more signs of co-operation in that endeavour.The chief comrade, leaning on the dispatch box, pointed out how he had written confidentially to the PM two weeks ago to offer support in getting children back to school south of the Border buthellipdidnrsquot get a reply.When Sir K claimed a poll had shown the public had lost trust in the Governmentrsquos handling of the pandemic Boris reached the second level of irritation.He expressed surprise at the Labour knightrsquos tone given he had ldquotaken the trouble to ring him up and had gone through the Governmentrsquos plan, which the Leader of the Opposition had ldquothoroughly endorsed.The atmosphere got icier as the chief comrade rounded on the Governmentrsquos ldquoworld-beating test and trace scheme, which, he said, was not fully up and running as promised but the PM muttered from his seat: ldquoItrsquos not true.Then, banging the dispatch box, Boris reached the third level of irritation, accusing his opposite number of casting aspersions on people who had volunteered to set up the new scheme from a standing start as a result of which ldquothousands of people had been tested and were self-isolating.As Tory hear hears rang out, the Labour chief calmly pointed out there were no precise figures and that even when the Government used statistics there were concerns from the official Statistics Authority they were not being used properly.

While the ious schemes put in place have been a welcome response by the UK and Scottish Governments, far too many tourism businesses have continued to fall through the gaps.“The requirement for applicants to have a standalone business bank account has proved particularly problematic.  Certainly it has prevented support reaching precisely the sort of businesses who need it most, including BBs.“I have been raising this point repeatedly with Ministers in recent weeks, including during discussions with the Finance Secretary earlier this week. To her credit, Kate Forbes accepted the unfairness in excluding so many genuine tourism businesses and agreed to review the position.  I welcome the fact that this review has led to a change that will give more local BBs the chance to access the support they need.“There are certainly more gaps that require to be filled, and I will continue to make the case on their behalf.  Meantime, for many BB businesses in Orkney, I’m sure there will be a sense of relief at this decision.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orcadian has made continued appeals to for the figures to be made public, along with other key figures relating to the outbreak in Orkney, and members of the wider community have called for transparency when it comes to way the crisis is being managed in the county.As it stands, Orkney has recorded eight test-positive cases of coronavirus, but no figure is available for the number of tests which have actually been conducted within the county.Now, it appears that regular updates on the number of folk being tested in each health board area in Scotland will soon be made available.Responding to a question put forward by Mr McArthur on the matter at today#s Topical Questions at Holyrood, health secretary Jeane Freeman indicated that information on tests conducted through NHS controlled facilities will be available shortly, subject to quality assurance. She explained: “We’re working to make sure that we give as clear and as robust data as we can possibly can and, as soon as we’re ready to publish that, and with what frequency we will update it, I’ll make sure Mr McArthur knows that.”Responding to this confirmation from Ms Freeman, the Orkney MSP said: “With test and protect already up and running and some restrictions now being eased, it is even more critical that the public are equipped with accurate, reliable and timely information so that they can make informed decisions going forward. “The number of confirmed COVID cases and COVID-related deaths are already published daily, but the public are still being left in the dark about the level of testing taking place.  Without these figures, it is impossible for anyone to make sense of what is happening on the ground.  “Being open and transparent about testing numbers is crucial to building public trust and confidence which, ultimately, is a key component in keeping our communities safe as we begin to ease restrictions over time.  “The First Minister not only agreed with me this point but also gave an assurance that ministers would now consider how to make this data available. “The Health Secretary has now provided her own assurance that the information will be available shortly. This needs to happen now, however, as the continued delays are doing nothing to help build public confidence at a time when people are desperately looking for clarity.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also indicates there will be further major costs from Brexit for years to come and also highlights that without an extension or having a free trade deal in place, Scotland’s agriculture, fisheries and manufacturing sectors will be especially badly hit.Ms Todd said: “Coronavirus is causing enormous economic disruption and people across the Highlands  Islands expect government to be focused on protecting public health and the Scottish economy.“It would be an act of extraordinary recklessness for the UK government to allow us to crash out of the transition period at the end of this year.“The SNP believe the best future for Scotland is as an independent member of the EU.“But regardless of your opinion on Brexit or independence, it makes no sense to crash out of the European single market at precisely the moment we need stability.“Businesses in the Highlands  Islands are focused on securing their future — they simply don’t have the capacity to prepare for Brexit on top of a pandemic.“The UK government must do the sensible thing, protect jobs in the Highlands and Islands and extend the transition period.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately, when the ban on non-essential travel hit in March we went from being fully booked to nothing, almost overnight.“Despite our bookings normally being largely made up of international travellers, we’re hopeful for a rise in UK staycations and a busy end to the year for our business.”The public’s “sensible and prudent” use of Household Waste Recycling Centres in the Western Isles since they reopened earlier this week, has led Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to revise the rules governing access to the facilities. The HWRC in Creed Park reopened on Monday after being closed as part of the coronavirus lock-down measures, with access initially limited to those arriving with waste for recycling in cars, with access for other vehicles planned to start later in the month.  But the authority has now confirmed that from todaythose arriving at the HWRC in Stornoway and at Rueval HWRC in Benbecula with household waste in vans, pick-ups and in vehicles towing trailers will also now be able to access the sites on weekdays, but with the cars-only rule remaining in place for Saturdays.Forestry and Land Scotland has been working with Raasay Development Trust to help keep a renewable energy scheme on track.The Inverarish Hydro Scheme is the first application of its kind to FLS’s Community Asset Transfer Scheme # to build and operate a community owned ‘run-of-river’ hydro scheme.But to secure feed-in tarf for providing power to the National Grid, the scheme has to be operational by September .Because of Covid- restrictions, the community is having to make some major adjustments to its plans to meet the deadline – and that includes working with FLS to reschedule some harvesting work.RDT Chair Iain Hector Ross said: “Sustainable energy solutions will help us tackle fuel poverty on the island and strengthen our continuity of supply while helping us fulfil our commitment to safeguard our environment for future generations.“The hydro scheme will improve the resilience of our community, giving us access to power, reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and establishing a small income stream that can fund other projects and contribute to a community benefit fund.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/francesca-tosolini-GyCD3-QbBdw-unsplash.jpg","title":"small b and bs now eligible for support through new government","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine Prior to the Scottish Government#s announcement on Tuesday, some small B and Bs had been ineligible for support due to not having a business bank account.Now those establishments will be able to apply for a share of £ million of funding which has been repurposed from the Newly Self-Employed Hardship Fund.This funding for small B and Bs will be administered by local authorities and applications are expected to open on th June.Commenting on Tuesday, Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: “Today I announced that £ million of the Newly Self-Employed Hardship Fund allocation will be re-purposed to support B and Bs who were ineligible for other support due to not having a business bank account.#These businesses are an important part of Scotland’s tourism sector, particularly in rural areas, yet were not eligible for support from the hardship fund.#I hope this change will help ensure they are ready to welcome visitors once again as soon as circumstances allow.“This support is not available to equivalent businesses in the rest of the UK and is another example of how the Scottish Government is reacting to meet the needs of businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.”Commenting on the news, David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses Highlands and Islands Development Manager said: “I have been approached by a range of long-established and well-known B and B operators during this crisis, all very concerned that they were missing out on Scottish Government support because they did not have business bank accounts.#There is absolutely no reason why they should, and it seemed very unfair that they were being refused funding on a technicality.“FSB Scotland is campaigning hard to ensure that cracks in the support mechanism for smaller businesses are filled in, and we are sure that right across the Highlands and Islands, many, many B and B operators will be drawing a huge sigh of relief at this news.”Highlands and Islands MSP Edward Mountain, who had been campaigning on behalf of businesses that were ineligible, welcomed the change of tact by the government.He said: “At long last, there is some business sense from the Scottish Government. I am delighted that this u-turn will mean hundreds of B and Bs will now receive the leline support they so desperately need.#Since I began this campaign I have been contacted by B and Bs in Glencoe, Strathspey, Skye, Aberdeenshire, and Dumfries – all have felt let down and abandoned by this Scottish Government.#Businesses who operate without business bank accounts should never have been ineligible for funding in the first place.#If the Cabinet Secretary for Finance had been more aware of the reality of how small businesses operate, then this fiasco could have been prevented from the beginning.#B and Bs have been made to wait too long for funding and I trust the Scottish Government will now make the application process as smooth as possible so funding can be delivered quickly.Skye MSP Kate Forbes said: “I am aware that some B and Bs had missed out on previous funding because they didn’t have a business bank account, and I have been working hard behind the scenes to help find a solution.“As of  June, such B and Bs can apply to a scheme administered by local authorities for a lump sum of £,, which was the default amount through the Hardship Scheme. This is specically for B and B businesses that don’t have a business bank account.“I realise that many people are facing signicant dficulties as we look ahead to a challenging tourist season, and also that this funding will not replace the lost income. I do hope, however, that it offers some help.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138062.jpg--.jpg?1590480532000\n","title":"slemish is part of three peaks fund raising event for air ambulance","story":"AIR Ambulance Northern Ireland, supported by Boost Drinks, has launched the annual ‘Three Peaks Challenge’ - which includes Slemish Mountain on September !

We did see a big crowd of young people walking down to the beach but it#s quiet enough.There should be more police about, but not so much this afternoon because it#s all families out. I saw the pictures of the crowds last night.Meanwhile, Pat Quinn from north Belfast was pleased to get some fresh air but it was actually the images of the crowds at the beach that made him want to visit.I go out for a walk most days for no more than half an hour but this is the first I#ve been out properly, stated Mr Quinn, who was sitting with his family. I saw the crowds on TV yesterday and that#s what made me come down today.The weather was supposed to be good so I thought I would take advantage. It#s just great today.The crowds seemed very big yesterday and thankfully it#s just not as big today.I#ve seen a lot of police knocking about and they#ve been walking around and talking to people.

I didn#t go out and I wasn#t in a good place mentally.It was Pete who got me online, without him I wouldn#t have access to the online exercise classes. He taught me how to get on this Zoom thing, so I could get the Friday chat with my friends. We all have a chat with Pete and his we Kathleen, we sit and talk about how we#re feeling. It all means a hell of a lot to us.He had the patience when others didn#t to make sure I was connected as I live alone.Ms Doherty said being able to log on for the classes has given her a reason to get out of bed.She continued: The classes make me get out of bed in the morning and it helps to have routine to my day. It starts the day on the right note.The exercise class can involve sitting on a chair and using tins of beans as weights and other things around the house. We would also do relaxation moments to help you relax and it is a gentle pace of exercise. Pete is one of the best andyou spoke to anyone out of our class they#d be saying the same thing.Before lockdown part of Mr Simm#s job with the Old Library Trust was community visits to carry out blood pressure checks.But when Covid- prevented him from doing this aspect of his job he was determined to ensure the physical and mental health of the people in his local community didn#t suffer. He said: When lockdown happened we couldn#t go out into the community to check people#s blood pressure but there were many people who were borderline high blood pressure or have hypertension or diabetes, who already took part in our exercise classes at the Old Library Trust to help manage their conditions.Keeping physically active is important in helping to manage such conditions as hypertension and diabetes as well as helping people#s mental health during this time. So although we couldn#t physically meet up we wanted to ensure people kept exercising so we increased the amount of exercise classes we offered and moved them online.Belfast Most ReadDerry twins Aoe and Adamsaw beloved dad die from a massive heart attack at  ... now their mum wants you to send them a birthday card to help heal their griefCoronavirus: Call for travel restrictions to halt scenes like this as young people in Northern Ireland urged #act responsibly# during lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann warns lockdown #not a holiday# as he announces £.m support for care homesCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Eight further deaths as Naomi Long warns that lockdown restrictions could be increased, NI workers may be exempt from UK#s -day air travel quarantine rule,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More shops at its retail park section will be open next week, such as Argos and Currys.However, in the short term only outlets with direct street access or direct access within a retail park are allowed to open - which rules out many non-essential outlets in shopping centres such as fashion retailers.Rushmere says it already has well-established social distancing practices, with one-way systems, live footfall cameras, floor stickers to mark two-metre gaps and heightened hygiene measures.It is in a category of shopping centres which have fared relatively well during lockdown because of its essential shops. But for other centres which are dominated by fashion and leisure offerings such as restaurants and coffee shops, it may be a dferent matter.Gone will be the pattern of shopping centre visits in the past - a leisurely dander through Primark or Next, followed by spontaneous visits to other shops, rounded off with a cappuccino and cupcake in a coffee shop.Instead, we are likely to face prolonged queues for the most popular stores - and once inside, there will be one-way systems restricting our way around. And the popularity of stores like Primark could mean that you will have to book a visit in advance.After all that queuing and bulk-buying, you might fancy a coffee and a sit-down - that could mean even more queuing outside the coffee shop, especiallyits capacity is cut from  tables to  in order to maintain social distancing.You might think, I#ll sit down on a mall seat for a rest instead. But as Peter Murray of Newry#s Buttercrane Shopping Centre has said, mall seats have been taken away, which means no lingering.The role of shopping as a family expedition might also change - stores which have to restrict numbers may not want a family group of five taking up space. The only customer who counts is the one with the buying power, rather than the bored kids.Many stores rely on impulse buys to bump up average spend - but there will be less scope for impulse.However, the hassle of queuing may mean that people do more planning ahead, therefore more bulk-buying could take place. There are just a small number of essential retailers open in CastleCourt Shopping Centre in Belfast, such as Halax, Holland  Barrett and Superdrug. It usually has around . million visitors a year. Across the city centre, Victoria Square is closed as it has no #essential# retailers. The big question, too, for both centres is whether office workersto the city centre in large numbers.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the future FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThey have been a destination for retail therapy for years - but one observer remarks that there may be more anxiety in shopping centre trips of the futureOur observer says: Locations that have the most essential retailers and are more community centres are the ones that will do better long-term. Yes, footfall may be down % but at least they have maintained shoppers and their shopping habits.The big issue iseveryone stays at home and doesn#t go back to the big urban areas to work shops and shopping centres will all be affected. You might normally have , transient workers and students in a city centre, butthat goes down to ,, that has the biggest impact of all.The physical layout of stores may also be dferent. With fewer people allowed in at a time, retailers might adjust the space for actual shopping, and instead increase their storage space - especially since goods which have been ed will need to be quarantined to make sure they#re virus-free before theyto the shop floor. Changing rooms are already out of bounds.Of course, plenty of us are die-hard shoppers and nothing will put us off spending our money when we#re allowed to do so in brick-and-mortar stores rather than online. It might just take a bit more planning than before.

Christine Chivers depiction of match day in Lavey is as majestic as the clubs sports hall is eye-catching. If you were writing a letter to Santa, asking for something your community is craving for right now, this is it. An array of goodness, colour and atmosphere. A hub of activity depicted to the very last detail by Christine, a retired art teacher. The love of her craft hasnt diminished one iota. Even the stanchions on the goalposts have been added, at the request of her husband Paddy, the clubs chairman, after he scanned over it for one last time. googletag.cmd.push Like families across the world, lockdown changed the shape of Christines week. The school runs have disappeared, caring for their grandchildren put to an end by a need for social distancing, her golf and helping around Lavey club also halted. “The club gates were locked up and I missed calling in there every day,” Christine commented. “Paddy could always have found an excuse to call in and attend to something or other. I enjoyed helping with reception duties and keeping our amazing facilities clean and tidy.” Until now. Updating her family photo albums is part of the new routine. When it was her turn to add to Damians collection, an football action photo set her creative mind wandering. googletag.cmd.push “He featured in a photograph taken by Mary K Burke for the County Derry Post. The high catch in this photograph inspired me to paint the ‘Love Our Club, Love Lavey’ painting,” Christine reveals. “I was old-school and when we grew up, we enjoyed the high catch – I just thought that was a fabulous skill and I liked that picture. “I was going to do a painting of that, but then I thought Ill do the whole club because we are missing the club. I put in the pitch and I just kept adding to it, I put the supporters in and I kept putting more and more detail into it. I really enjoyed doing it.” She took photos of the clubhouse and the pitch to help her with the overall scaling. “I was trying to capture the colour, excitement and special atmosphere of match days,” Christine explains. “The only part of the painting that is from an actual game is the high catch at midfield. The rest of the players and supporters are imagined, although I did model two of the younger supporters on Eimear and Aodhan my grandchildren, who are underage players and keen fans.” Her love and interest in sport isnt something recent. Christine, originally from Swatragh, is from the Quinn family steeped in the GAA. Her sisters Bernie , Patsyand Sarahanneall had distinguished camogie careers. The family was also immersed in Scoacuter, football and hurling. “My younger brothers, Roddy A, Adrian and Iggy, hurled for club and county. My older brother, Dickie, played senior football and for many years continued as a dedicated member of the thirds,” Christine explains. “GAA was a constant topic of conversation in our house and it continues to be so, with many of my nieces and nephews starring on club and county. “Sundays were always match days in Ballynian where I grew up,” she adds. The field at the back of the house was flat, goalposts were put up and the pitch was marked out and all. “Jim B Bradley and lots of cousins came over over, two teams were picked and we had some great games of football, hurling and camogie. “All the boys and girls played all codes. Sarahanne turned out to be the best hurler and camogie player and was always a first pick. “A highlight was mammy bringing out the plate of orange segments at half time. The sun always seemed to shine then and we have some great memories.” Christines artistic passion also grew. When the Far East magazine arrived at home, the colouring in competitions were done and sent away. “And the very few times, you would win something from it.” she remembers. “I was always interested in it, right from primary school.” Like many schools, reading, writing and arithmetic were the order of the day at the local St Johns in Swatragh, but when Maura McKenna came in as a student teacher in Primary , Christines love for art deepened even more. “We did art competitions, it was brilliant and I can remember it to this day – I really enjoyed it,” Christine said, with total enthusiasm. “I went to Loreto in Coleraine and it was such a fabulous place for anybody to go to, for anybody who was interested in art. “The art department was down at the road, in a lodge and was separate to the rest of the school. There were so many opportunities.” She was lucky to have TP Flanagan, who painted pieces for Seamus Heaney, as a tutor in St Mary’s Teacher Training College in Belfast. In , Christine joined the Art and Design Department in St Mary’s Grammar School, Magherafelt, where she was popular with her pupils, one of whom remarked how she was always smiling, an example of someone revelling in their job. BBC Broadcaster Thomas Niblock is a past pupil and always remembers Christines first words when he stepped into the school in first year. “Someday you will all travel the globe, make your way in the world and decorate your own homes,” she would tell them. “My job is to provide you all with a true appreciation of art and the joy it can bring,” Thomas remembers. “To a -year-old, that felt like million miles from where I was, but I remember her saying it. It stuck,” states Thomas. “Her teaching  percent instilled that appreciation and education that will stay with me for le. More importantly, a lovely human-being and it was a privilege to be taught by her.” Christine spent her teaching le in the school - over  very happy years, something she labels as a privilege. “To work with so many exceptional staff and students, I couldnt explain how happy I was going to work every day, the children were so talented and such lovely children to work with.” In retirement, art has certainly not being left to one side and she has painted many local settings, such as Moyola Park Golf Club and the recently refurbished Lavey chapel. As we talk on the phone, Christina is heading for her first round of golf in eight weeks. Her husband Paddy has been a member there all his le. “They did lessons for ladies four years ago. We have had great fun and we were the first ladies team to win an Ulster medal for Moyola.” In recent years, the painting hasnt been as plentul, but now she is back in full flow. “I particularly enjoy painting with oils and have previously painted many scenes in my locality, including local homesteads, local bars and places of interest. “I knew I wanted to include our amazing clubhouse in the composition, Christine said of her most recent masterpiece. “I miss the excitement and camaraderie of match days and I tried to capture that by adding players and supporters. I took a few photographs of the pitch and the clubhouse. “The weather was kind and I set my easel outside the back of the house. It was really enjoyable getting the oil paints out and painting outside, while listening to my favourite album, Neil Diamond’s ‘OriginalHot August Night’ from .” It was a work of art and a labour of love, all rolled into one. Not one to be rushed. A glance at the images around this feature showcases the level of detail required to fully depict a scene. Doing it justice is the most important thing. “It seemed to take forever - the painstaking level of detail required me to use tiny, No , paintbrushes,” she explains. “I thought I had it perfect and was ready to pack up my paints when Paddy came along and said where are the stanchions, so I had a little more to do. “Painting is such an enjoyable experience, especially at a time like this when you have lots of time on your hands - to start with a blank canvas, draw and paint and create something.” Christine points to the other people in the locality and their creative side. Drawings, paintings, sketches, poems, songs and stories have all been produced depicting their Love for Lavey. “In Lavey, we are incredibly proud of that group in our community who got together  years ago and built our state-of-the-art facilities,” Christine adds. “Everyone in the parish benefits from the healthy lestyle that Erin’s Own Club and Termoneeny Community association has to offer and the friendships that develop there too.” She points to the minors winning the football and hurling double, a group that added an Ulster football title – giving great hope for the future. “We look forward to the day when our weekly activities all begin again, the walking, cycling and running groups,” Christine concludes. “Mary’s baby massage and yoga classes, Thomasina’s mindfulness sessions, Parish events, Mary’s Young at Heart groups, local PS events, local schools coaching and competitions, Anne’s yoga and spinning sessions, Darragh and Katrina’s circuits.” A litany of a le currently on hold. When Lavey parish s from the wilderness, the characters in Christines paintings will burst back into le, all in the perfect colour in which they have been depicted. Love your community.

When the Far East magazine arrived at home, the colouring in competitions were done and sent away. “And the very few times, you would win something from it.” she remembers. “I was always interested in it, right from primary school.” Like many schools, reading, writing and arithmetic were the order of the day at the local St Johns in Swatragh, but when Maura McKenna came in as a student teacher in Primary , Christines love for art deepened even more. “We did art competitions, it was brilliant and I can remember it to this day – I really enjoyed it,” Christine said, with total enthusiasm. “I went to Loreto in Coleraine and it was such a fabulous place for anybody to go to, for anybody who was interested in art. “The art department was down at the road, in a lodge and was separate to the rest of the school. There were so many opportunities.” She was lucky to have TP Flanagan, who painted pieces for Seamus Heaney, as a tutor in St Mary’s Teacher Training College in Belfast. In , Christine joined the Art and Design Department in St Mary’s Grammar School, Magherafelt, where she was popular with her pupils, one of whom remarked how she was always smiling, an example of someone revelling in their job. BBC Broadcaster Thomas Niblock is a past pupil and always remembers Christines first words when he stepped into the school in first year. “Someday you will all travel the globe, make your way in the world and decorate your own homes,” she would tell them. “My job is to provide you all with a true appreciation of art and the joy it can bring,” Thomas remembers. “To a -year-old, that felt like million miles from where I was, but I remember her saying it. It stuck,” states Thomas. “Her teaching  percent instilled that appreciation and education that will stay with me for le. More importantly, a lovely human-being and it was a privilege to be taught by her.” Christine spent her teaching le in the school - over  very happy years, something she labels as a privilege. “To work with so many exceptional staff and students, I couldnt explain how happy I was going to work every day, the children were so talented and such lovely children to work with.” In retirement, art has certainly not being left to one side and she has painted many local settings, such as Moyola Park Golf Club and the recently refurbished Lavey chapel. As we talk on the phone, Christina is heading for her first round of golf in eight weeks. Her husband Paddy has been a member there all his le. “They did lessons for ladies four years ago. We have had great fun and we were the first ladies team to win an Ulster medal for Moyola.” In recent years, the painting hasnt been as plentul, but now she is back in full flow. “I particularly enjoy painting with oils and have previously painted many scenes in my locality, including local homesteads, local bars and places of interest. “I knew I wanted to include our amazing clubhouse in the composition, Christine said of her most recent masterpiece. “I miss the excitement and camaraderie of match days and I tried to capture that by adding players and supporters. I took a few photographs of the pitch and the clubhouse. “The weather was kind and I set my easel outside the back of the house. It was really enjoyable getting the oil paints out and painting outside, while listening to my favourite album, Neil Diamond’s ‘OriginalHot August Night’ from .” It was a work of art and a labour of love, all rolled into one. Not one to be rushed. A glance at the images around this feature showcases the level of detail required to fully depict a scene. Doing it justice is the most important thing. “It seemed to take forever - the painstaking level of detail required me to use tiny, No , paintbrushes,” she explains. “I thought I had it perfect and was ready to pack up my paints when Paddy came along and said where are the stanchions, so I had a little more to do. “Painting is such an enjoyable experience, especially at a time like this when you have lots of time on your hands - to start with a blank canvas, draw and paint and create something.” Christine points to the other people in the locality and their creative side. Drawings, paintings, sketches, poems, songs and stories have all been produced depicting their Love for Lavey. “In Lavey, we are incredibly proud of that group in our community who got together  years ago and built our state-of-the-art facilities,” Christine adds. “Everyone in the parish benefits from the healthy lestyle that Erin’s Own Club and Termoneeny Community association has to offer and the friendships that develop there too.” She points to the minors winning the football and hurling double, a group that added an Ulster football title – giving great hope for the future. “We look forward to the day when our weekly activities all begin again, the walking, cycling and running groups,” Christine concludes. “Mary’s baby massage and yoga classes, Thomasina’s mindfulness sessions, Parish events, Mary’s Young at Heart groups, local PS events, local schools coaching and competitions, Anne’s yoga and spinning sessions, Darragh and Katrina’s circuits.” A litany of a le currently on hold. When Lavey parish s from the wilderness, the characters in Christines paintings will burst back into le, all in the perfect colour in which they have been depicted. Love your community. Love your club. Love Lavey. RELATED - Derry clubs leaving a legacy during lockdown. More...

However, concern has been raised about a group of young people who are harassing workers on the site. The construction of the new centre had to be stopped because of the lockdown restrictions. However, work has now recommenced following the easing of some aspects of the restrictions. A spokesperson for Shantallow Community Centre, however, said it was important that the contractors were allowed to get on with the project in peace. Unfortunately they are being harassed by a handful of local young people, the spokesperson said. googletag.cmd.push I am asking all parents and any adults to make a point of walking through the Donkey Field - community centre area when you can - out doing their daily exercise, walking the dog or just to check the site.

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt RevAndrew Forster, joined scores of parishioners from the Parish of St Augustine’s and further afield for the service at Bishop Street car park in the city centre on Sunday morning to mark Pentecost Day. The service,which took place in glorious sunshine,was led by the Rector of St Augustines - ‘The Wee Church on the Walls’ -Rev Nigel Cairns. The car park adjoins St Augustine’s Parish Hall and is opposite the city’s courthouse. A team of volunteers, dressed in ‘high-vis’ vests and PPE gear, oversaw a one-way, ‘car ferry’ type system, that meant cars were directed in one entrance and out bya dferent route after the service. googletag.cmd.push Social-distancing guidelines required all those present to remain in their cars during worship, and parish volunteers ensured that none of the worshippers fell victim to the soaring temperature. Bishop Andrew, who preached the sermon,welcomed the congregation to what he called his ‘back garden’ . He said: St Augustine’s was known as ‘the Wee Church on the Walls’. Today, we’re the wee church without walls. I always think about St Augustine’s as the wee Church with a big heart and today we’re showing our big heart because we’re together, worshipping God on this Pentecost Sunday. googletag.cmd.push “This is definitely a first for me,” the Bishop said, “and I would imagine it’s a first for many of you as well, but God is here and we worship him in spirit and in truth.” Rev Cairns echoed Bishop Forster’s welcome to the first ‘Drive-through Church’ in the inner city, and thanked all those who had helped make the service possible. He said the St Augustine’s parishioners would be gathering for worship in the same location again next Sunday.

The ‘Day Today’ shop at the corner of Rathlin Gardens is known locally as Harry Doots, harking back to a previous owner of the shop. Now, a special mural has been created at the shop to mark this famous name. Patrick McCloskey, the current owner of the store, said he was delighted with the mural which celebrates the signicance of the shop to local residents over the decades. As well as Harry Doots shop, graffiti hotspots around Bishops Field, Central Drive, Cromore and Rathlin Gardens in Creggan have also been transformed into real works of art over the past week. googletag.cmd.push Karl Porter and Donal O’Doherty of the guerrilla street art group UV Arts teamed up with Creggan Enterprises and Creggan Neighbourhood Partnership , and with young people from the local area, to give the neighbourhood a facelt. CNP’s Tony O’Doherty said the clean-up of the lane behind the Creggan shops on Central Drive was very much appreciated by the local community. “Karl and Donal’s magnicent art-works have really given new le to the place,” he said. “These young artists are really to be commended. If we’re to frank about it, this work was long overdue, but it has transformed this area from a non-descript back lane into an outdoor urban gallery.” googletag.cmd.push The artists also worked with young people to create colourful new entrances for Bishop’s Field Paacuteirc an Easpaig. Conal McFeely of Creggan Enterprises said it was ‘entirely appropriate’ that one of the new murals at the facility would acknowledge and celebrate the potential of our young people. “It is very important that we pay tribute to the immense effort being done by young people - within families, the community and within the frontline services - during this Covid crisis. “There is an old Irish saying – ‘Mol an Oacuteige agus tiocfaidh siacute - Praise young people and they will flourish’, and this concept is now proudly emblazoned at the entrance to Bishop’s Field, thanks to Karl and Donal.” Local resident, Kitty McDaid, speaking on behalf of her neighbours, said: “We are over the moon with all the new artwork and the clean-up of the lane behind our homes, a massive thankyou to all involved.” Not far from Central Drive, at Cromore and Rathlin Gardens work was also carried out to clean up some of the most signicant areas. Using distinct themes, the artwork added a vibrant splash of colour to each area. Jim Brown, Creggan Community Collective, explained the signicance of the new artwork at Cromore. “People are pulling together at this time, the community are giving freely of their time and effort to help others. There is an understanding that what is required is “Solidarity… not Charity. “Creggan people are resilient, and have learned that we cannot simply rely on the state or anyone  to help us, we have the capacity to help ourselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The campaign, which is run by the Child Accident Prevention Trust, is taking place throughout this week – with advice, tips, guidance and interactive tools available from the CAPT website. Mayor Tierney said that he didnt hesitate in giving his backing to a cause that he knows is vitally important for families across the District. As a parent myself, I know that each and every mother, father andhas their childs safety as their number one priority at all times. googletag.cmd.push I also know that accidents can happen so easily and unexpectedly, and Child Safety Week is an initiative which offers us all useful advice on how we can take actions to prevent such incidents. Its fantastic to watch our children grow, and to see their curiosity and their desire to learn about everything around them, but sometimes that can lead to things like burns, scalds or even poisoning. Mayor Tierney continued: Of course, we all take steps to ensure that our child is never in danger, but its extremely dficult to foresee everything. The Child Accident Prevention Trust have done a fantastic job in putting together a host of tools and information that helps continue our education as parents and s about the dangers around us – particularly in this current period when, as families, we are spending a lot more time in our homes. googletag.cmd.push I would encourage everyone to avail on the resources available as we raise awareness during Child Safety Week.

Cathal Mallaghan of Sinn Feacutein was appointed as Chair at last night’s AGM and he told the County Derry Post how he hopes to get the local economy moving again. “Keeping people employed in work is going to be the number one issue. Without that you’ll see a lot of families struggling financially,” he said. “In one of the recent reports, its showed that Mid Ulster would be one of the hardest hit regions because we are heavily dependent on manufacturing, so there’s a big task there. googletag.cmd.push “It’s going to be an important time to support our local community groups and our businesses to try and get everybody back up and going and restarting the economy.” Cllr Mallaghan, a native of Pomeroy, Co Tyrone, is taking on the role for a third time. He previously acted as a presiding councillor in the council’s initial ‘shadow year’ and also assumed the role for a brief period following the co-opting of Linda Dillon to the NI Assembly. In what he describes as his first ‘proper’ year, he is hoping to continue the council’s reputation for building good working relationships. “There is a good relationship between the councillors and the senior management team,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “The senior management team, led by Anthony Tohill, have a good understanding of what the council wants and how they see things moving forward. “They have a good relationship with community groups and businesses on the ground, which is important when you’re trying to take projects forward. “The parties in Mid Ulster Council work well together too, although obviously there is going to be a dference of opinion on issues. “When it comes to supporting communities, or the likes of delivering the rural development programme, all the parties are on the same page and supportive of that kind of work.” Cllr Mallaghan praised the impact of community groups in the region and said he hoped to help Mid Ulster Women’s Group on an ambitious project. “Mid Ulster Women’s Aid want to build houses in Cookstown to further their work in protecting women who have been subject to domestic violence. “If I could do something in these  months to take that forward and get the council to work along with them, I think that would be a great achievement.” He also hopes to revisit the Maghera Public Realm Scheme and bring it to completion alongside similar projects in the region. He said: “We had three very successful schemes in Dungannon, Magherafelt and Cookstown which are completed, and Coalisland is almost finished. “Change is dficult for some people, particularly when you want to do what you can to improve our town centres, but I’m sure the Maghera scheme will be successful and people will be happy with it.” “It’s going to be a very unusual year as chair, because of the way things are with restrictions and everything . “Hopefully when the relaxations begin to take effect later in the year, we’ll start seeing a bit more normality again.” Other Sinn Feacutein councillors have also taken on key roles following the AGM. Brian McGuigan has become Chair of the Audit Committee, with Niall McAleer as Deputy Chair. Sean McPeake takes on the Chair of the Planning Committee, while John McNamee becomes Chair of the Development Committee, with Sean McGuigan and Catherine Elattar taking on Chair of the Environment Committee and Housing Council Representative respectively.

Cathal Mallaghan of Sinn Feacutein was appointed as Chair at last night’s AGM and he told the County Derry Post how he hopes to get the local economy moving again. “Keeping people employed in work is going to be the number one issue. Without that you’ll see a lot of families struggling financially,” he said. “In one of the recent reports, its showed that Mid Ulster would be one of the hardest hit regions because we are heavily dependent on manufacturing, so there’s a big task there. googletag.cmd.push “It’s going to be an important time to support our local community groups and our businesses to try and get everybody back up and going and restarting the economy.” Cllr Mallaghan, a native of Pomeroy, Co Tyrone, is taking on the role for a third time. He previously acted as a presiding councillor in the council’s initial ‘shadow year’ and also assumed the role for a brief period following the co-opting of Linda Dillon to the NI Assembly. In what he describes as his first ‘proper’ year, he is hoping to continue the council’s reputation for building good working relationships. “There is a good relationship between the councillors and the senior management team,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “The senior management team, led by Anthony Tohill, have a good understanding of what the council wants and how they see things moving forward. “They have a good relationship with community groups and businesses on the ground, which is important when you’re trying to take projects forward. “The parties in Mid Ulster Council work well together too, although obviously there is going to be a dference of opinion on issues. “When it comes to supporting communities, or the likes of delivering the rural development programme, all the parties are on the same page and supportive of that kind of work.” Cllr Mallaghan praised the impact of community groups in the region and said he hoped to help Mid Ulster Women’s Group on an ambitious project. “Mid Ulster Women’s Aid want to build houses in Cookstown to further their work in protecting women who have been subject to domestic violence. “If I could do something in these  months to take that forward and get the council to work along with them, I think that would be a great achievement.” He also hopes to revisit the Maghera Public Realm Scheme and bring it to completion alongside similar projects in the region. He said: “We had three very successful schemes in Dungannon, Magherafelt and Cookstown which are completed, and Coalisland is almost finished. “Change is dficult for some people, particularly when you want to do what you can to improve our town centres, but I’m sure the Maghera scheme will be successful and people will be happy with it.” “It’s going to be a very unusual year as chair, because of the way things are with restrictions and everything . “Hopefully when the relaxations begin to take effect later in the year, we’ll start seeing a bit more normality again.” Other Sinn Feacutein councillors have also taken on key roles following the AGM. Brian McGuigan has become Chair of the Audit Committee, with Niall McAleer as Deputy Chair. Sean McPeake takes on the Chair of the Planning Committee, while John McNamee becomes Chair of the Development Committee, with Sean McGuigan and Catherine Elattar taking on Chair of the Environment Committee and Housing Council Representative respectively.

Ronan Valley Golf Course, a ‘pay and play’ facility outside Magherafelt, has seen its numbers rise by ‘% more than normal’ since it reopened, with people from all around flocking to the venue. Owner Peter Tohill says the fact that the club does not operate a membership system has been an advantage. “We’re a pay and play facility, we don’t have members so we weren’t bound by the Golf Union of Irelandrules,” he said. “The rules that apply are the government’s social distancing guidelines and using proper hygiene and that type of thing. googletag.cmd.push “That’s why we didn’t have to operate a booking system, you just turn up. It’s worked quite well so far, we opened last Wednesday and we’ve been incredibly busy. “We have people coming from all over the north. We’ve had golfers here this week from Belfast, even Newtownards. Omagh, Derry city, people who wouldn’t normally have been with us.” Although it was relaunched in , Ronan Valley had operated before World War II, but the outbreak of war saw interest wane and the course closed soon afterwards. While the prolonged spell of fine weather is bringing the crowds back, it is not without its drawbacks. googletag.cmd.push “We don’t have an irrigation system so it’s a bit dry,” said Peter. “There’s a lot of work being done in the early hours of the morning with regards watering and cutting. It’s too busy to get work done during the day! “Last year, from the th July until Christmas, there weren’t three dry days in a row. Normally it would take a few dry days in a row before people would even start to think about golf. “The longer the good spell of weather goes on, the more people want to come and play.” Staff at the venue have been taking every precaution to prevent the spread of Covid-, with sanitisation stations dotted throughout the course. Flags and hole cups have also been sanitised and a strict policy of social distancing is in place for everyone using the course. Peter says they haven’t had to work too hard to enforce it. “I was worried before we started, but people have been absolutely brilliant,” he said. “Avid golfers will be members somewhere, so they would tend not to play here, but a lot of them are having dficulty getting into their own clubs with the booking system that’s been operating. “People are just so happy to be out, so they stick to the guidelines and don’t mind the wait. Sometimes they’re waiting about twenty minutes to get teed off. “We’re saying ‘sorry about the wait’ and they say, ‘we’re standing here, we’re outside, we’re able to talk to our friends at a distance and we’re happy enough.’ “I can’t complain, it’s working for us!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The meeting yesterday of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning Committee heard that the local authority is facing an estimated loss of pound.m for the   financial year because of the pandemic. This loss is a result of issues such as the closures of leisures facilities and museums, as well as money usually generated by the councils planning and building control departments. It was agreed at yesterdays meeting that the council should ask the government for more financial support. googletag.cmd.push The councils Lead Finance Officer, Alfie Dallas, presented a report to the meeting outlining the full extent of the financial problems facing the council. Mr Dallas said that the councils annual expenditure was poundm. He said that rates received from both business and domestic properties funded % of this expenditure. “This is obviously a very concerning and challenging position and one which, in the absence of signicant Government intervention, could have a signicant impact on Council services both during   and into subsequent financial years, with signicant challenges for the upcoming   rates process,” said Mr Dallas. “In line with the Local Government Finance Act, it is clear that as a result of COVID  and without signicant Government support, that reserves would be inadequate to fund Council services for the   financial year and place Council in an insolvent position.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Dallas outlined a number of steps the council had taken in a bid to mitigate the losses. This included securing an anticipated poundm from a fund set up by the government to help local governments through the coronavirus crisis. The council is also expected to save pound.m as a result of being able to temporarily lay off around  employees through the governments furlough scheme. Another pound.m has been secured to cover the costs of the council-owned City of Derry Airport until the end of this month. Mr Dallas said the proposed savings identied by the council came to almost poundm. However, he added that this would still leave the council with a remaining estimated deficit of pound.m for this financial year. Councillors at the meeting spoke about their concern that the current situation would have on the striking of rates in future years. Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said it was a very gloomy picture. He praised the councils financial management in recent years which had allowed it to build reserves which were helping the local authority through the current dficult period. Independent councillor Paul Gallagher described the situation as very scary and said he was really concerned at the rates outcome facing the council. He highlighted that many local businesses who pay rates to the council are not open and many of them will not have any income for a long period. Cllr Gallagher said any expected crash in terms of the rates income able to be generated by the council would have a serious impact on its operations. He proposed that the council write to the British Treasury asking it to subsidise the councils rates base for the next two years. He said this would allow businesses to build up their income to pre-coronavirus levels. DUP councillor Hilary McClintock said it was important to engage with government to look at ways of minimising the impact on local ratepayers. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly said it was likely that the full impact of the coronavirus on the councils finances would be seen in future years. Councillors agreed at the meeting to support Councillor Gallaghers proposal that the Treasury be asked to provide more financial support for the council.

Almost  resources which showcase the rich cultural heritage of the Causeway Coast and Glens council area have been brought together for the first time. The Heritage Audit was carried out as part of the PEACE IV Understanding Our Area programme by Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Museum Services. It uncovered a range of trails, publications and other resources which combine to create an invaluable tool which tells the story of the region. Congratulating all involved in the project, Councillor Orla Beattie, Chair of the Peace IV Partnership said: “The Heritage Audit rightly identies that while we live in a Borough globally renowned for sites like the Giants Causeway and Bushmills Distillery, its history and heritage is vibrant, proud and local and spans centuries. googletag.cmd.push “The inclusion of sites, places, heritage trails and historic churches is a credit to the curators of our local heritage, local people and committed volunteers. This audit is a repository that can grow and develop further, not to mention the huge Peace idend that can come from a project such as this. Heritage and local history as a discussion point or opportunity to explore is, and will remain, an important and valid Peace-building tool. “Finally, much appreciation and gratitude must be shown to the SEUPB for making this publication a reality under Peace IV, the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Museums Services for enabling its delivery, to Abarta Heritage for its expertise in pulling this all together so beautully and, finally, to the participants of this project, who will continue to keep their local heritage alive through their dedication and passion. googletag.cmd.push The Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Councillor Sean Bateson said: “On behalf of council, I would like to highlight the huge contribution which PEACE IV funding is having on communities in Causeway Coast and Glens. The PEACE IV programme has seen investment across the area and this Heritage Audit is one of many important resources for the future produced under the Understanding Our Area programme. The resource is available now and I would encourage everyone to explore the contents and immerse yourself in the story of our fascinating area.” Details of each resource have been added to an interactive map, creating an online information hub where visitors can readily access and experience the stories of the area. The full audit and map are available for free viawww.niarchive.org audit If you are aware of a community heritage resource that is not included, please get in touch with Museum Services by emailingcms@ causewaycoastandglens.gov.uk  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Oran Kearney, who managed Higgins for two seasons at Coleraine, felt he was a player that would stay in the game and tips him to do a great job for Ireland. After much speculation, Higgins was last week confirmed as Kennys Chief Scout and Opposition Analyst. “Any manager will tell you, your back-room staff will make or break you,” Kearney told the County Derry Post. “I think it is that level of trust. There will be a few wildcards that hewont have worked with before. googletag.cmd.push “Also, you can see why he has stuck with two or three of his Dundalk back-room staff, who he trusts imperatively and that is very important going forward.” Higgins began his playing career with local side Newtowne FC, before being signed by Coventry City, where he spent six seasons before being released in . The  year-old was snapped up by Derry City, where he spent five years and won four League Cups in a row and the FAI Cup in , Kennys last game in his first stint as Candystripes boss. Higgins spent a season in Dublin with Bohemians, before being brought back to the Brandywell by Kenny. googletag.cmd.push Higgins flicked on goalkeeper Gerard Dohertys kick forward to create Rory Pattersons winner in an - extra-time FAI Cup triumph over St Pats in . Higgins was then signed by Kenny at Dundalk, were he won the league and cup double in . After a spell with Coleraine, he ed to Oriel Park to join Kennys management team and was the opposition analyst when Dundalk won the  title, before being promoted to assistant manager. He was very much in demand, and was muted as a target to succeed Kearney after his switch to St Mirren. “He was brilliant around the changing room,” Kearney commented of Higgins two seasons as a Coleraine regular. The current Bannsiders boss isnt surprised his former player has stayed the game and pursued an avenue in management. “Ruaidhri, to be fair, was always one of those guys who you have a fair idea would remain involved in the game because he has all the credentials and, as Stephen Kenny mentioned through the week, is a real student of the game. “He is somebody who is very passionate about how he keeps on top of things and everything that is going on. “It is great for him and I am delighted to see him get that post and I am sure he will do a great job.” As one of the senior players, Higgins was someone Kearney would have sounded out ideas on. “Hewould have been the first to tell you that mobility wouldnt have been his strongest asset. His biggest strength was in his mind, he was probably yards ahead of other players. He was a very intelligent player and you can see why he has carried that on. “There would be senior pros in the changing room, that you definitely bounce ideas off or get feedback from. Ruaidhri was one of those guys who was quick to ask questions, in a good way. It is a sign of an open mind and that he was keen to push on.” Kenny was the Irish U boss and due to succeed Mick McCarthy after Euro , but with Covid- forcing the postponement of the competition, the FAI acted to promote Kenny to the senior manager post. Ireland must navigate the play-offs, beginning with a semi-final clash with Slovakia, with Northern Ireland or Bosnia-Herzegovina awaiting them on the other side. Before that, Kenny and his new management team continue to prepare for a UEFA Nations League visit to Bulgaria in September, their first game in charge. Higgins is currently studying for his UEFA Pro-Licence in a group of  applicants that include former Irish captain John OShea and ex Spurs and Cha goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, who are due to graduate in .

I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful. I hope people continue to give money as itrsquos a vital service for the whole of Northern Ireland.To donate go to www.justgiving fundraising eoin-keating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 27%2C 2000  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH ndash Residents at a Ballynahinch housing estate are due to hold talks with a range of key officials this morning in a bid to raise the profile of the area.People from the Hillcrest Drive area in the town are due to meet with senior officials from the Housing Executive, Down Council and the Department of Environment.The meeting comes in the wake of recent vandalism attacks in the Windmill Street area which damaged a number of cars, homes and business properties.Prior to this morningrsquos meeting, residents met with local councillor Anne McAleenan to discuss their concerns and prepare for the crucial talks with the representatives of the statutory agencies.Last weekend, the local councillor discussed with residents their concerns and advised them to draw up a strategy and work closely with the ious agencies who could provide them with key assistance.One of the main concerns is an area at the top of Hillcrest Drive which residents would like to see the Department of Environment cleaning up to enhance the image of the area.In addition, residents are calling for environmental improvements and also believe sealing off the rear of the estate from the lough area could prevent trouble at weekends.KILLYLEAGH ndash The impact a young Killyleagh footballer is having on the international soccer stage was praised at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Down Council.Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne highlighted the achievements of  year-old David Healy who marked his Northern Ireland debut with a brace against Luxembourg and another strike against Malta.Mr Osborne said the young Manchester United star was a great ambassador for the area and last week received the international personality of the year award at the annual Northern Ireland soccer writers awards sponsored by Guinness.The local councillor said Healyrsquos success for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland team was a great boost for the area.ARDGLASS ndash An Ardglass couple are waging a war against hostile waters in an attempt to circumnavigate Ireland for charity.Rhonda and Vincent Kearney set sail in their -foot boat, Invinceable, on Saturday to make their way around Ireland in a bid to raise pound, to help buy a new leboat.And while the duo is no stranger to challenge, both sailors admit they face a fearsome feat.Vincent is a former Red Arrow and a stunt motorcyclist, while his we, Rhonda, is the former British clay pigeon shooting champion, but nothing, they say, could prepare them for the journey they are now making.ldquoWe only concocted the plan three months ago and thought we had better act quickly before we have time to think about what we are letting ourselves in for, said Vincent.ldquoI have been sailing on and off for about  years and have owned boats for quite some time, but it will still be extremely dficult, particularly with the dreadful weather forecasts we have been given.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps. Just recently, Gerry made it back to the top of the famous landmark again mdash only this time he did it from the comfort of his own home.A decade ago, Gerry enjoyed good health and loved every minute of his visit to France but in  Loughinisland GACrsquos hard-working secretary contracted lung cancer, having never smoked a day in his le.In September that year, surgeons removed one of his lungs and between then and Christmas Gerry received chemotherapy treatment to assist his road to recovery.As a result of his illness, he was referred to Macmillanrsquos lsquoMove Morersquo initiative at Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick, which is specically designed to help people to get active and stay active with physical activity during and after most types of cancer treatment.Under the watchful eye of initiative co-ordinator Laura McGrath, Gerry loved the camaraderie of being with others referred by medical staff to take part in physical activity which can help educe the side effects of treatment, prevent the occurrence of other long-term conditions and reduce the risk of cancer spreading or ing.ldquoThere were just four of us at the start, recalled Gerry. ldquoWe started off in the old leisure centre which was subsequently replaced by a more modern building and there are now around  people who take part.ldquoWe all look forward to the classes every Thursday morning and after our warm-up routine we then proceed around a circuit and spend time on ious equipment, including a rowing machine. We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything. It was just the fillip that I required.

It will mean people can enjoy an evening together while still maintaining social distancing in the comfort of their own car.As a start, Cllr Devlin is keen to see a drive-in cinema in Newcastle to mark the start of her year in office.She explained that this would allow the local authority to gauge its success and how it complements the legislation on social distancing.ldquoHopefully after this, we may be in a position to roll this venture out across the entire district over the course of the year and include all our towns, said Cllr Devlin.ldquoAlready, this idea has gained a lot of support from local people which I think is a testament to the need that currently exists within all of us to connect and eventually interact with our family and friends once more.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThe test of how we unlock this will be in how we can continue to adhere to essential government guidelines on social distancing and ultimately defeating this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul running in aid of MYMY  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man who has been running five kilometres every day since the beginning of the lockdown has raised over pound, for a local mental health charity.Paul Tumelty found himself with more time on his hands when the seaside coffee shop he worked in was forced to close its doors under government guidelines to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.The  year-old father of two, says he never thought of running until he saw a Facebook post from Mind Your Mate and Yourself , stating that the charity was struggling financially.It was forecasting ain income of pound, because of the cancellation or postponement of fundraising events.Paul, who has suffered from mental health issues, realised the importance of the charity after experiencing a number of family tragedies and decided he would help raise money to help them bridge the deficit.ldquoI always need to be doing something.

are recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us.

The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer.

But,all  fails, you will understand that for the safety of our community members that we will be left with no option other than to close the grounds completely. Please spread this message to users of our grounds.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews said he hoped people would respect the wishes of the Passionist Community and listen to the appeal which has been issued.He said Tobar Mhuirersquos trails were extremely popular with local people and the retreat facility was well used by walkers, especially at this time of the year.Cllr Andrews said while people are allowed to exercise daily, they can continue to walk in Tobar Mhuirethey obey the advice that they have been given and stay away from a number of designated areas.ldquoThe advice in relation to social distancing remains in place and people need to adhere to public health advice to prevent the spread of the coronavirus which has had a devastating impact across the globe, he continued.ldquoThe advice is to stay away from certain areas and this should be relatively straight forward given the size of the complex. The Passionist Community provides free access to the trails for the benefit of the local community and this is greatly appreciated by the people of Crossgar in particular.Cllr Andrews described Tobar Mhuire as a ldquohaven of peace and tranquillity and appealed to people to stay away from the areas highlighted.He continued: ldquoNo one would want to see public access to the grounds prohibited and the Passionist Community has made this clear.ldquoIt is important that visitors recognise that Tobar Mhuire is home to elderly and vulnerable people, some of whom are self-isolating, and must not do anything that would potentially put their safety at risk. People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure.

At the newspaper archives in Belfast, David looks at the newspaper articles from the time. David realises he was  days old when he was found: “So this means that for the first couple of weeks of my le someone fed me, clothed me, kept me warm, loved me. Someone genuinely cared.” When David learns he has a full sister who was also abandoned as a baby, he says: “It’s dficult to take it in that the same thing had happened to me happened to my sister. That’s shocking. Why do our parents make the decision to leave us  It’s happened once, so why make the decision again ”David now lives in Birmingham with his we and their three children. He also has four grown up daughters.Helen lives in Navan. She has a son and two daughters.The pair met for the first time in a guest house in Carlingford. David comments: “The only sad thing for me ispolice had been able to put two and two together at the time we could have grown up together. She’s been deprived a brother and I’ve been deprived of a wee sister.”The programme concludes dramatically as Davina McCall reveals to David and Helen the identity of the pair’s parents.Their father was a married Protestant from Dublin who was having an affair with their mother, an unmarried Catholic from Kerry.Their father had  other children with his we before David and then Helen were born out of the affair which spanned many years.David said that their parents dferent religions and the fact the babies were born out of wedlock might have been why they were abandoned.The first part of Long Lost Family: Born Without Trace was shown last night. The second part is on tonight at pm on ITV.It focuses on foundlings – people abandoned as babies, often in the first hours and days of their lives.

This is most evident in my baking, and in particular my annual attempt to create a birthday cake for my son.The discipline requires patience, precision, and a certain delicacy of touch. I possess none of these. I am not suited to the art, like a baby elephant trying to play the harpsichord.The malaise is compounded by the fact that, in an effort to please my boy, I attempt cakes beyond my modest skills. There was the pirate ship cake which sank without trace, the superhero cake which was powerless, the tiered cake which succumbed to gravity and the Halloween cake which was scary for all the wrong reasons.This year’s challenge, set many months ago, is a dinosaur cake. I have been thinking about the task for some time, and, perhaps persuaded that thorough preparation will improve the outcome, I have become more optimistic than experience has taught me is wise. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I have selected a T-Rex cake which requires complicated assembly. For several weeks I have been gathering all of the required ingredients and studying techniques. During the day, when I should be working, I have often found my mind wandering towards the processes of cake construction. At nighttime, when sleep eludes me, baking fills my thoughts.And so, on the eve of my son’s birthday, I begin.And immediately it begins to go wrong.The batteries on my kitchen scales fail. Exactitude is everything in baking and I’m left guessing quantities based on judgment. My previous optimism is quickly replaced by the familiar low feeling of imminent failure as the mixture goes into the oven.Worse follows. Despite a liberal pre-greasing, the risen cake refuses to come out of the mould, leaving me desperately scrabbling and scratching at the sides of the tin to loosen it.Eventually the cake exits the tin. Or, to be more accurate, some of it does, because much of the top layer which represents the detail of the T-Rex is left behind.As I try to balance the cake on a wooden board, cracks begin to appear and it seems that large chunks may be about to separate, sort of like a sweet and spongy version of continental drt.The ghosts of past baking disasters are now vivid. I have no choice but to move forward. I have to try and decorate the wretched, misshapen dinosaur.I have determined that I will make icing and buttercream. Then I will add food colouring to create dferent shades, to give the cake definition.It goes well at first. And then it doesn’t.The consistency is all wrong and I can’t master the colours that I want. I watched a YouTube video about making and colouring icing and was struck by the sheen and brilliance of the end product. My icing is pallid and dull, asit has been through the digestive system of a cat.Despite this, I proceed, applying icing to the edges of the cake with all the delicacy of a rough-handed navvy.It is the use of the icing piping bag which almost breaks me. I struggle to find any adequate method of getting the buttercream into the little cone-shaped bag. Then, when I finally get to the point of squeezing the bag, the contents come out the top rather than the bottom. There is some fine icing applied, to be sure, but unfortunately it is upon my arm rather than the cake.My long-held intention of piping fine little green stars onto the T-Rex is quickly abandoned. I lower my ambition to just getting any buttercream onto the surface. It is very much like a severely inebriated man who can’t locate the light switch in the bathroom trying to put toothpaste onto his toothbrush.I have bought lots of brightly coloured chocolate sprinkles which I use to try and cover up some of the worst excesses of the damage. It does not work.Earlier I had printed out a photograph of the cake which I wanted to replicate and kept it beside me as a guide while I worked. I look at the photo now, then back at my creation. Is it vaguely recognisable as a T-Rex  Perhaps so,only from the exact moment when the asteroid landed on it.The further I go with this the worse I feel. Once again I have embarrassed myself and let my son down. It pricks a feeling within me which is never too far from the surface that I cannot do anything right. That I am bound to contaminate anything I touch. That my choices are always the wrong ones.The introspection gives way to a feeling closer to desolation and dark questions. What will people think  Why bother trying anything when I am bound forever to fail  And then, the one which is as constant as my shadow, wouldn’t it be betterI wasn’t here at all I’m nibbling at my fingernails as my son enters the room and climbs onto a chair to see what I am doing. He notices the creation and gasps.‘Wow daddy! That is so cool!’He glances at the photo of the perfect cake, and then back at my T-Rex.‘Yours is better daddy, much better. It’s the best cake I’ve ever seen!’He hugs me and, at once, I know that I have all the answers that I need. He runs off excitedly to tell mummy, leaving me pondering how easily I can be pulled in one direction, then the other. I’m reminded once again of the importance of seeing the world through other people’s eyes, of not just listening to the voices inside my own head, that there is more than one narrative to le. A hug and an encouraging word can turn a rough experience into something very dferent.Getting through tough days is a lot like baking a cake – it might not turn out the way that you had hoped, it might get messy, but at the end of it all it can still taste delicious.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

It is not an easy and quick solution because many buildings do have poor ventilation.Hanging around at the bar could be replaced with technology to allow orders to be taken remotely.Prof Noakes said: ldquoTransmission happens when somebody is in prolonged contact , soyou can reduce the amount of time bar staff are, for example, spending with people, then that will help.ldquoThere are about one in  people who are thought to be infected, andyou start to think about a crowded pub, you very easily are going to have a probability of having someone who is infected in that pub.ldquoAs the number of cases in the community drop your risks start to become much lower, and hopefully we get to a point where there is such a small number of cases and hopefully with an effective track and trace system in place that it means the measures are less important.Shaun Fitzgerald, an RAE visiting professor at Cambridge University and a Sage Environmental Working Group member, suggested family-friendly restaurants where relatives can sit together at a table a sufficient distance away from others.Ventilation of the venue is importantand ldquobecomes rather more challenging in colder weather when people are not as willing to throw open a window.Trying to get an organisation back up and running could include having a quarter of the workforce in at one time to make social distancing easier, according to Dr Fitzgerald.Felicity de Cogan, an RAE enterprise fellow,said a lot of work is being done to develop self-cleaning surfaces, which could be applied to areas like heavily used door handles and railings.Such surfaces are designed to be permanently antimicrobial to kill any virus or bacteria that lands on it.She said: ldquoWe know that technologies such as silver and copper are % effective but they are % effective after two to six hours, which is not quick enough. The time-frame we really need is seconds to minutes.The aim is also to build this technology into materials so there is an extended time of protection, ldquoideally for years, and then this can be built into environments as a long-term solution..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: How pubs may try to control the spread of Covid- article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Co Armagh Orangemen go above and beyond call of dutyOrangemen in Co Armagh have raised more than £, to help those fighting against coronavirus and those worst affected by lockdown.By Graeme CousinsThursday, th May , : pm\"\"Bessbrook District made a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting the cheque for £, to Jane McKimm, Head of Communications, and Helen ONeill, Director of Finance.at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, for

unless to do so in a voluntary capacity.”Support included preparing food hampers for elderly and vulnerable brethren, and others in the community, making donations of food and goodies to frontline hospital staff, making monetary donations to charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area Hospital.Mr Watson said: “One of the first things put in place by the County Grand Lodge was the issue of a daily prayer from our County Grand Chaplain, Wor Bro Rev Dr Alan McCann, to members by email and posting on the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House, Loughgall Facebook page.County Grand Lodge Officers made a donation of £, to the Southern Area Hospice as they are currently unable to fundraise, and this was presented to Anne Dalzell, hospice representative, at Sloan’s House : Other rd Party“The response has been very favourable in these trying times, with the daily reach on Facebook being between  and over ,.”He added: “The museum at Sloan’s House was very proud to display the Grand Lodge banner of support for the NHS and other frontline services on the front of the building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\"

The outdoor wedding, the first to take place in the district since the introduction of restrictions in relation to COVID-, was also the first wedding to ever take place in the award winning Council public park. The sun shone on Julie and David as they made their vows in Grange Park to become the new Mr and Mrs Hannaway with the ceremony conducted by Fermanagh and Omagh District Council Registrar, Hazel Alderdice. Speaking about the ceremony, the Councils Registrar, Hazel, said: It was an absolute joy to officiate at Julie and Davids wedding in Grange Park. With the introduction of COVID- restrictions in March, many weddings within the district were cancelled or postponed which was obviously very distressing for all those involved. Following the easing of restrictions in relation to outdoor civil ceremonies the Council applied to have Grange Park listed as an approved venue for outdoor ceremonies so that those wishing to get married at a Council venue within the district could choose between Enniskillen Castle and Grange Park. Grange Park proved to be a lovely location for the wedding and we would like to extend our very best wishes to the new Mr and Mrs Hannaway. Speaking after the wedding ceremony, the new Mrs Hannaway expressed her thanks to the Councils Registrars for their help in arranging the service saying, We are so happy it came together so well. Following the easing of COVID- restrictions, outdoor weddings can take place currently with a maximum of six people in attendance. The Councils Registration Service has been receiving a number of enquiries from couples in relation to having an outdoor wedding since the easing of some restrictions, said Hazel. Our Registrars are pleased to offer information and advice to couples on planning their wedding at this time and we now look forward to conducting more weddings within the district over the coming months, Hazel added.
