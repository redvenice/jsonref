Nilsen (pictured) wife of Man Utd\u0027s Victor Lindelof are staying at the Renaissance with the England teamEngland\u0027s players will be staying in the same hotel as the Swedish WAGs ahead of tomorrow\u0027s World Cup quarter final, MailOnline can reveal.Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying.But the Swedes are bragging they already have the edge after they were booked into Samara\u0027s only five-star resort - leaving England in a more modest four-star hotel. Sweden\u0027s FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027  His countrymen are in the Lotte Hotel, which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area.   The hotel\u0027s sumptuous  fine food menu lists the amount of calories contained in each item for weight watchers - which even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16.Their players can also tuck into tuna with chukka seaweed salad, crab cake with tomato salsa, roast duck, creme of pumpkin soup with Kamchatka crab and cream cheese and tiger shrimp and scallop brochettes and a filet Mignion steak.          Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance (pictured) in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying          England has been allocated the four-star Renaissance (foyer pictured) Hotel in Samara while their World Cup quarter final opponents are staying at the town\u0027s only five star resort           Sweden are crowing to have been allocated better accommodation than their rivals. Their FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson (left) joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027Rebekah Vardy reveals the England sex ban has been lifted...Share this articleThe country\u0027s FA general secretary Hakan Sjostrand chuckled: \u0027Yes we also have caviar on the menu, but that will be OK as long as England have their fish and chips.\u0027 Meanwhile Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be staying on the outskirts next door to an Ibis hotel with a McDonalds nearby and traffic streaming outside and fridge magnets are on sale in the foyer for  £1.50. The Renaissance offers a range of salads, soups, grilled meat and fish in its \u0027Terrace\u0027 restaurant with its most pricey item being a grilled steak for £22.           England boss Gareth Southgate had no say in the hotel, which was chosen by FIFAHowever, England\u0027s players rarely eat in hotel restaurants and have their own food prepared for them by an official FA chef.The 196-room Renaissance was opened in 2003 with rates starting at £70 a night compared to the more expensive Lotte where the cheapest rooms are £200. But the standard of cotton sheets and the fine food will be forgotten once the teams do battle for a place in the World Cup semi-finals.Mr Nilsson, who was wearing his country\u0027s football short and is a Wolverhampton Wanderers fan, said: \u0027 FIFA chose this hotel. So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off. We beat Portugal last year in a friendly.          The Swedes are in the Lotte Hotel (pictured), which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area where the cheapest rooms available at the moment are £200 per night          The Lotte\u0027s sumptuous fine food on offer even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16\u0027And we won the group of four here which had Germany in it and we have just beaten Switzerland in Russia who are ranked sixth in the world…why shouldn\u0027t we be confident?\u0027We also have the biggest respect for our opponents. But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory. But overall, a fair match which will be great for the supporters and enjoyed by the world.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/10/4DF8318B00000578-5924913-image-a-22_1530869652502.jpg","title":"How Jesse Lingard Englands King Social Media","story":"    This tweet by Jesse Lingard this week assured his place as the king of social media in the England team, whose image has been transformed by players\u0027 use of Instagram and Twitter          He is now turning his footballing and online prowess into a strong brand, based on his distinctive goal celebration, in which he spells out his initials with his hands          He is now busy building a brand around his celebration and his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027The public\u0027s love of the England team is a million miles from when Sam Allardyce lost his job as England manager  after he was filmed talking to undercover reporters posing as businessmen.Back then, confidence in the national team was at rock bottom.  But now, just two years on, England have rebuilt their public image, thanks to squeaky-clean Gareth Southgate and his squad of fresh-faced young players.Among them is 25-year-old Lingard, who, with four million Instagram followers, is at the head of a group of stars whose social media posts are watched by thousands of young fans.EXCLUSIVE: Sweden\u0027s WAGS will stay at the same hotel as the...EXCLUSIVE: Man dumped by Gareth Southgate\u0027s wife for England...Share this articleA social media hit this week came Jesse filmed fellow young player Trent Alexander-Arnold saying \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 to him on the pitch after the Colombia victory.Lingard has also posted videos of himself dancing in his pants with Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the changing room, being shaved by teammates and celebrating with fans.Such videos give fans a players\u0027 eye view of the World Cup and take supporters inside the England camp in a way never seen before.     He is currently believed to be single after his relationship with Jena Frumes ended in scandal          Jena split from Jesse before tweeting: \u0027At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\u0027          Lingard and Ms Frumes split up in March after she posed for steamy pictures in his shirtSocial media experts say his and other players\u0027 tweets and videos are building a new image for the national side, totally distinct from the days of \u0027dentist chair\u0027 drinkathons and Graham Taylor\u0027s \u0027turnips\u0027.Former Twitter head of sport Lewis Wiltshire told The Daily Star: \u0027If there is a player who uses Instagram better or more effectively than Jesse Lingard, I\u0027m yet to see them.\u0027These players are from a generation where they understand and enjoy this stuff.\u0027I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s at the heart of why this England team\u0027s public image is different from, say, 10 years ago.\u0027Mr Wiltshire says he doesn\u0027t believe a representative handles Jesse\u0027s social media for him, as with other players, which may be part of its success.The Manchester United midfielder could now use his performances in the World Cup to launch a strong Beckham-like \u0027brand\u0027.He has used Instagram to give fans a players-eye view of the World Cup, including video of him dancing in his pants in the changing room  He stays close to his grandmother and grandfather, who helped get him into football as a childThree weeks before the tournament, Lingard applied for four trademarks, three centred on his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027 and another featuring his goal celebration, in which he holds his hands in front of his face and spells out his initials.He has since launched a clothing range, including caps, T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with his goal celebration logo, which have already all sold out on his website jlingz.com.Andy Sutherden, head of sport  marketing at H+K Strategies, told CityAM: \u0027Jesse Lingard\u0027s team has acknowledged the fact that if he does well in Russia, there’s an immediate opportunity but one with a very short shelf life. \u0027They’re also understanding of the fact that people who become known for something different - think Crouch and the robot - extend their marketing appeal beyond the audience of sport.\u0027 Meanwhile, there are rumours that Manchester United bosses are set to increase his wages from £75,000 to £150,000 to keep other clubs from trying to tempt him away.

Veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash (pictured today on Sky News) said the proposals left \u0027a lot of questions\u0027All of the Brexiteers in the Cabinet signed off on the plans on Friday night - even Mr Johnson despite telling the meeting it was a \u0027turd\u0027. Eurosceptic MPs lashed the ministers today.One Brexiteer lashed Mr Gove as \u0027the main snake in the grass\u0027, after he spoke up in favour of Mrs May\u0027s plan during a 12-hour meeting of the Cabinet at Chequers. Another senior MP told the Telegraph: \u0027They should have spoken for Britain.\u0027They failed. They are selfish iniduals who put career before country. \u0027It is pretty bloody obvious they prefer their ministerial cars.\u0027Mr Gove\u0027s decision may backfire and destroy his rekindled leadership ambitions. \u0027His pretensions to being a credible leader have been blown to smithereens,\u0027 said one senior Brexiteer to the paper.\u0027He\u0027s a busted flush.\u0027 An ally of Mr Johnson said: \u0027There is no doubt we would be heading for an even softer Brexit had Boris not been around the table.\u0027 Anger at Mrs May\u0027s proposals was growing today.Veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash said the proposals left \u0027a lot of questions\u0027 and warned the Prime Minister a confidence vote was unstoppable if 48 Tory MPs write to 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady.Sir Bill told Sky News: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of unhappiness.. is this going to be a proper Brexit?\u0027 Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told Radio 5Live: \u0027I\u0027m very, very disappointed with the offer that we\u0027ve seen coming out of Chequers. I\u0027m disappointed that so called Brexiteers in the Cabinet didn\u0027t pick up the cudgels and fight for a better offer.\u0027Bearing in mind this is an offer it\u0027s not a deal because it will be undoubtedly from the record, further diluted by the EU during negotiations. T\u0027To be honest having looked at the three page summary, I haven\u0027t seen the 120 page detail, but I imagine that it will have been spun by No 10 as that\u0027s the best of the deal.\u0027I\u0027ve seen Martin Howe QC\u0027s legal opinion. I wouldn\u0027t support this deal if the EU were paying us.\u0027    Boris Johnson, pictured left, stunned fellow ministers with a four-letter dismissal of Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan during Friday\u0027s Chequers meeting after Mrs May, right, called for loyaltyToday\u0027s accounts of Friday\u0027s showdown revealed Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson stunned fellow Ministers with his four-letter dismissal of the Prime Minister\u0027s plan at Friday\u0027s special Chequers summit designed to unite the Cabinet. His comment risks making him the first victim of Mrs May\u0027s fresh crackdown on dissent.Mr Johnson – who has been accused of betrayal by Tory Brexiteers for not blocking Mrs May\u0027s \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 proposals – spoke out against the plan for the UK to remain in Bline with Brussels rules in a new free trade zone with the EU.According to a reliable source, he complained that anyone obliged to defend the proposals would be \u0027polishing a turd\u0027.He added sarcastically: \u0027Luckily we have some expert turd polishers\u0027 – shooting a glance at one of Mrs May\u0027s spin doctors.Challenging the Prime Minister\u0027s new policy to her face, he said that her decision to try to \u0027align\u0027 UK trading rules with the EU would reduce Britain to the humiliating status of a \u0027vassal state\u0027.He also took issue with her cher-ished new customs plan, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), claiming it would be a \u0027serious inhibitor\u0027 to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries.His outburst was revealed just hours after Mrs May tried to draw a red line under weeks of open dissent from her Ministers, vowing that from now on she will enforce collective Cabinet responsibility and sack any Ministers who defy her. Some senior Tories believe she may be forced to fire Mr Johnson.    The outburst was revealed hours after Mrs May threatened to sack disloyal ministersA Mail on Sunday poll today endorses her handling of the Cabinet showdown, with 33 per cent of voters supporting her Brexit plan and 23 per cent opposing it. The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/09/4E07B7C100000578-0-image-a-6_1531039254881.jpg","title":"Bulls runners endure slippery start second day Pamplona festival","story":"    Two festivalgoers try to hold off a rampaging bull as one of them struggles to get off the ground in the center of the city\u0027s bull ring          A man is carried aloft as he is smashed into by one of the rampaging animals inside the stadium complex on Sunday morning          An enraged bull smashes into a runner against the hoardings as several horrified onlookers watch on from the safety of the stands          A worried team of medical services personnel carry an injured man away on a stretcher after he was hit by the galloping bulls          A man receiving urgent medical attention in the middle of the street as medics hold up a sheet to cover the patient from the rain          A couple kiss in the street after the bull run is over and the streets empty out following the second day of the Running of the BullsPamplona bull run 2018: All you need to know about San...‘I thought I was in Pamplona’: Nine bulls ‘rampage’ through...Thousands take to the streets in Spain to protest against...Share this article    Terrified revellers flee in utter panic as the charging bovines head towards them with razor-sharp horns capable of goring          A man is sandwiched between two one-tonne beasts as the charging pack makes its way through the narrow city streets          Dozens of frightened runners scramble to get out of the way of a hulking bull as they fling themselves to the side of the cobbled streets for safety.

But when you’re England manager, the media attention, criticism and pressure never stops. I’m hugely enjoying it, though.’ It was my turn to laugh. ‘You realise that unless you win a trophy, you’ll be mocked, abused, deemed a failure and unceremoniously sacked?’Southgate smirked. ‘I do, yes, thanks for reminding me.’ ‘Of course,’ I added, ‘if you win the World Cup, it’s knighthoods and statues all round.’ He nodded. ‘Of course!’ Southgate struck me then as a very nice guy with just the right perspective on a job that has crushed the soul of some of the world’s finest managers.10.52am Lord Sugar, still licking his wounds from that ridiculous Senegal tweet fiasco, is back on the social media platform this morning. ‘The question is will it be Sir Garath Southgate,’ he opines. ‘That’s unlikely,’ I respond, ‘as his name is Gareth.’11.30am Emboldened by my victory over Sugar, I turn my tweeting turrets on ‘Saint’ Gary Lineker, the BBC’s top football presenting star who’s been posting regular videos of himself scoring important World Cup goals. ‘Do you have any of you scoring in a European Championship or World Cup final?’ I ask, knowing the answer. ‘Haven’t played in one, sadly,’ he replies. ‘Got a World Cup semi-final one ready if England make it. Looking forward to your video scoring for Harlow College.’ I was promptly deluged with mocking abuse. Why do I do this to myself?          An excited young England fan holds up a  \u0027It\u0027s Coming Home\u0027 placard.

David Baddiel, who originally recorded It’s Coming Home with Frank Skinner, tweeted: ‘In not a great omen for the game, our guinea pig has just died. Then again, he was called Bjorn.’2.40pm Southgate appears. He sounds confident, calm, focused. ‘I’m enjoying this,’ he says.2.54pm News breaks that North Korea has dismissed high-level talks with a US delegation led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as ‘regrettable’ and has accused Washington of trying to unilaterally pressure the country into abandoning its nukes.           It\u0027s coming home! England fans jump for joy after the full time whistle in Samara, Russia as the Three Lions go through It momentarily distracts me until I remember the words of the great Liverpool manager Bill Shankly: ‘Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I can assure you, it’s more important than that.’ Nuclear war will just have to wait a bit.2.55pm I’ve now been joined by a dozen members of my family. ‘Sexy man!’ sighs my 21-year-old niece Phoebe as the camera pans to Harry Kane in the tunnel. ‘WHAT?’ shrieks her brother in horror. ‘Only joking,’ she clarifies.3pm Today’s referee is called Bjorn. He’s Dutch and FIFA’s top-rated official, but I still don’t like the man who may decide this match having such a Swedish name.3.02pm There are thousands of empty seats. I was annoyed by this until it was revealed it’s because German fans bought the tickets assuming they would make this stage. Then I found the empty seats hugely amusing.3.06pm England get an early chance but Dele Alli fluffs his pass to Harry Kane. These bloody Spurs players – the team’s full of them and they can’t be trusted.3.10pm It’s been a slow, jittery start. ‘Does it feel nervy to you?’ commentator Guy Mowbray asks his colleague Martin Keown. ‘It does,’ says Keown, ‘it’s like the handbrake’s on for both sides.’ ‘Well, take it off then!’ exclaims my father from his armchair.          The 25-year-old defender\u0027s first goal at international level could prove to be an important one as England reach their first semi-final in 28 years3.12pm Sweden have a shot but it flies just over the bar. The room erupts into a massive collective ‘OOOHHH’. Things are tense.3.17pm The game’s getting worse – slow, scrappy, scruffy, suffocating, unsettling. Of course, I’ll take another 73 minutes of this – if we win. But it’s agony.3.20pm Kane has a half-chance. ‘England are beginning to wake up,’ says Keown. ‘They should have been bloody awake when they started the match, for God’s sake,’ snaps my father. He’s a lifelong Spurs fan, so you’d think he’d be used to watching rubbish football.          Captain Harry Kane celebrates with his friends and family following his side\u0027s victory in the quarter final against Sweden in Samara3.27pm The fourth official remonstrates with Southgate about something. I assume it’s to stop his players being so boring.3.30pm BOOOOOM!! England spectacularly snap out of their stupor to take the lead with a brilliant headed goal by the other Harry – Maguire. The room erupts with hysteria, as I imagine does most of England. One Direction star Louis Tomlinson best sums up the mood of the nation: ‘Get the f*** in! Smashed it, Harry Maguire, you beauty!’ Radio One’s Nick Grimshaw sees a neat link to today’s other big event in Britain – the London Pride gay parade. ‘OMG,’ he tweets, ‘if England win and it’s Pride, it’s coming homo!’          Henderson spends time with his children after bagging a spot in the semi-finals by beating Sweden in Samara, Russia3.40pm Former EastEnders star Ross Kemp, who posted a shocking topless shrieking video after we beat Colombia, is back with more. ‘YEEEESSSSS!’ he screams, ‘And we hold. We do not give in. We do not allow them to score.’ It’s terrifyingly inspiring.3.42pm England fans burst into a rousing God Save The Queen. She’s probably watching the tennis but it’s a nice thought.3.43pm Raheem Sterling, who has an assault rifle tattooed on his leg, bursts clean through, but woefully fluffs his shot. ‘Jeez, Sterling,’ I tweet. ‘If you must have a machine gun tattoo, you can’t shoot like that!’ Amusingly, this is immediately retweeted by Robert O’Neill – the Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden.3.44pm Sterling does it again, this time missing even more embarrassingly. ‘Take him off!’ screams my mother, normally a voice of compassion in such moments. The pressure’s getting to all of us.          After some spectacular saves against Sweden that helped take the Three Lions to the semi-finals, Jordan Pickford is awarded Man of the Match in Samara 3.46pm Halftime. Phew. I’m exhausted. Watching England is an endurance contest, and one you know normally ends in abject failure. It’s rarely a happy experience. We’re winning, but it doesn’t feel like it.3.48pm The BBC shows great clips of crowds going absolutely nuts all over England when Maguire’s goal goes in. Croydon is by far the most wild and raucous – which is no surprise to me because Susanna Reid’s from Croydon and every night out we’ve had together is like that.3.57pm Remainer MP Anna Soubry randomly tweets me to ask: ‘Alan Shearer just said Sterling should “flick his balls”. How’s that going to help him score?’ I ponder a few seconds then reply: ‘Arousal is a proven contributor to performance.’3.58pm ‘Statto’ Lineker informs us that Sweden have never won a World Cup match where they’ve been losing at halftime. That’s comforting. Shearer adds: ‘No stupid errors and we’ve got this.’ That’s less comforting – we always make stupid errors.  That\u0027s my boy! England manager Gareth Southgate hugs midfielder Dele Alli after nodding in the second header of the match4.02pm A horse called Roaring Lion just won at Sandown. The stars, and nags, are aligning.4.03pm Jordan Pickford makes a brilliant save. Our very inexperienced goalkeeper is emerging as England’s superstar, something absolutely nobody predicted three weeks ago.4.06pm BBC Today Show presenter Nick Robinson tweets: ‘Is it me or is 1-nil the most stomach-churning score?’ It’s not just him. It’s all of us. We need another goal to calm the guts.4.15pm BOOOOOM! Dele Alli scores. It’s 2-0. It IS coming home! I leap from my chair and do a conga round the garden. It’s not a pretty sight but what I lack in technique, I make up for with enthusiasm.4.18pm Pickford makes another sensational save. Ross Kemp is back, still topless, and still screaming: ‘PICKFORD! YOU BEAUTY! YOU BEAUTY!’4.20pm Even the professionals are shedding their natural doubts. Former England striker Peter Crouch confesses: ‘Right, I’m all in, it’s coming home.’4.21pm I’m A Celebrity winner Georgia Toffolo is emotional: ‘I just cried, this is amazing, come on.’          Manager Gareth Southgate embraces Harry Maguire after one of his goals saw England through to the semis4.22pm Maguire misses a sitter… ‘How can he get that timing so wrong when he’s being paid so much to play?’ my sister demands to know from her perch on the sofa. I’m the least opinionated member of my family.4.28pm Pickford saves us yet again. He is definitely getting a statue, probably just for this match. The clock’s ticking down, and so are my shredded nerves. It’s torture, yet I’m beginning to see a tiny light at the end of the dark tunnel of tension.4.30pm Alli goes off, very, very slowly. I love his time-wasting just as much as I would hate it if I were Swedish.4.41pm The camera pans to a beautiful but distraught blonde Swedish female fan. England fans begin chanting: ‘You’re sh** but your birds are fit!’ I’m appalled with myself as I laugh out loud.4.44pm ‘Dare I say it, this looks like the perfect performance at the moment,’ says Keown. NO, MARTIN, DON’T SAY IT.4.45pm Comedian Jack Whitehall, a fellow Arsenal fan, is clearly wrestling with the same dilemma as me – how to a cheer a team full of players from our most bitter rivals. ‘I never thought it would happen,’ he tweets, ‘and I can’t believe I’m saying this… but I genuinely think Tottenham might be in with a chance of winning a trophy here.’4.46pm Sweden get a free kick in front of goal. My heart stops. But their shot balloons so high over the bar it will need Tim Peake to get it back.4.50pm The room bursts into ‘God Save The Queen’, for no other reason than we are all feeling ridiculously happy and patriotic.4.52pm It’s over. We’ve done it. It’s so weird, I almost enjoyed watching England play a World Cup knockout game.4.59pm An email arrives from my Army Colonel brother, serving his country in a less joyous part of the world. It’s his birthday next week and I’d sent him a box of cigars to make up for the fact he’s not allowed to drink alcohol. ‘Got back to my office after watching the game to find your gift,’ he wrote. ‘What perfect timing, guess what I’m about to do now?’ Happiness is a cigar… and England getting to the semi-final of the World Cup.5.05pm Southgate goes to applaud the fans as ‘All You Need Is Love’ booms out on the PA system. It’s a perfect moment. This smart, decent, impressive man has restored so much pride, dignity and grace to English football.And in doing so, he’s proven so many people wrong, not least the loud-mouthed pundit who said this after he was given the job: ‘There are a legion of better managers than Gareth Southgate in the world. \u0027The objective should be dragging the England team out of its abyss and dragging us kicking and screaming – under the tutelage of a brilliant, dynamic new manager – into the next phase of our existence. Instead, we’ve gone for the easy option, the cheap option by the strict criteria of: he’s got to be English and barely useless and I don’t get it.’That half-witted imbecile pundit was… me.

I\u0027m disappointed that so called Brexiteers in the Cabinet didn\u0027t pick up the cudgels and fight for a better offer.\u0027Bearing in mind this is an offer it\u0027s not a deal because it will be undoubtedly from the record, further diluted by the EU during negotiations.

I wouldn\u0027t support this deal if the EU were paying us.\u0027    Boris Johnson, pictured left, stunned fellow ministers with a four-letter dismissal of Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan during Friday\u0027s Chequers meeting after Mrs May, right, called for loyaltyToday\u0027s accounts of Friday\u0027s showdown revealed Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson stunned fellow Ministers with his four-letter dismissal of the Prime Minister\u0027s plan at Friday\u0027s special Chequers summit designed to unite the Cabinet. His comment risks making him the first victim of Mrs May\u0027s fresh crackdown on dissent.Mr Johnson – who has been accused of betrayal by Tory Brexiteers for not blocking Mrs May\u0027s \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 proposals – spoke out against the plan for the UK to remain in Bline with Brussels rules in a new free trade zone with the EU.According to a reliable source, he complained that anyone obliged to defend the proposals would be \u0027polishing a turd\u0027.He added sarcastically: \u0027Luckily we have some expert turd polishers\u0027 – shooting a glance at one of Mrs May\u0027s spin doctors.Challenging the Prime Minister\u0027s new policy to her face, he said that her decision to try to \u0027align\u0027 UK trading rules with the EU would reduce Britain to the humiliating status of a \u0027vassal state\u0027.He also took issue with her cher-ished new customs plan, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), claiming it would be a \u0027serious inhibitor\u0027 to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries.His outburst was revealed just hours after Mrs May tried to draw a red line under weeks of open dissent from her Ministers, vowing that from now on she will enforce collective Cabinet responsibility and sack any Ministers who defy her. Some senior Tories believe she may be forced to fire Mr Johnson.    The outburst was revealed hours after Mrs May threatened to sack disloyal ministersA Mail on Sunday poll today endorses her handling of the Cabinet showdown, with 33 per cent of voters supporting her Brexit plan and 23 per cent opposing it. The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/10/4E08C97A00000578-0-image-a-2_1531040434881.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment politics professors cat interrupts live TV interview leaping HEAD","story":"    Lisio decided to hop on Dr Targalski\u0027s head as the professor was being interviewed on live TV          But Dr Targalski was not phased by the cat taking up his new position and carried on speaking          He remained unperturbed despite the ginger moggy wrapping its tail around his head At one point the moggy wrapped his tail around Dr Targalski\u0027s face - but the academic was still unperturbed.Dutch journalist Rudy Bouma, who was conducting the interview, shared a video of the cat\u0027s antics on Twitter and it has currently been shared almost 9000 times.Go-cats!

It follows Arthur Less – who keeps emphatically reiterating that he is absolutely not heartbroken by his boyfriend marrying someone else – from San Francisco to Japan, to Italy and back again. Like a rare diamond, Greer’s prose sparkles, illuminates and cuts. I’ve also just been sent an advance proof of some new Lucia Berlin short stories, Evening in Paradise (Picador). Any publication of hers is a major cause for celebration, as far as I’m concerned. I might have to feign illness to devote myself to them. I’m hoping to pick up a copy of Lauren Groff’s new novel, Florida (William Heinemann), before I head off to the Highlands next week her last book, Fates and Furies, was a fascinating and febrile read. This one promises snakes, sinkholes and sisters, so I’m in.Rupert Thomson is an astonishing writer, who should be far more celebrated than he is. His latest novel, Never Anyone But You (Little, Brown), is immensely surprising, fully imagined and totally original. We live in an age of wonderful science writing, and Carlo Rovelli’s new book, The Order of Time (Allen Lane), is an example of the very best. Time is something we think we know about instinctively here he shows how profoundly strange it really is. Also, The Accident on the A35 by Graeme Macrae Burnet (Saraband): it’s a long time since I read a police procedural (more or less) that was so gripping and intelligent.For literary refreshment, try the playful, artful Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata (Portobello). For a properly sweltering read, you need One Star Awake by Andrew Meehan (New Island), all gorgeous longing and hunger in Paris. Those who can’t sleep in the heat might find the ingeniously disquieting stories in Things We Lost in the Fire by Mariana Enríquez (Portobello) apt. If I manage a couple of days off, I’ll head for Kerry on the Atlantic coast of Ireland and take Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier (Bodley Head) and a recently delivered proof I can’t wait to get stuck into: Crimson by Greenlandic sensation Niviaq Korneliussen (Virago).If you like your holiday beach reads to include a measure of deep existential terror – and who doesn’t? – I am happy to point you toward Mariana Enríquez’s utterly brilliant short story collection Things We Lost in the Fire (Portobello). Instead of returning home with a tan, you will be likely to return home looking pale and haunted, and with your eyes sunken in your skull, but you will thank me for the tip. (Either that or you’ll curse me for it, it’s pretty much 5050.) Perhaps even less appropriate a beach read is James Bridle’s book New Dark Age (Verso), an extraordinary, perceptive analysis of the various ways in which the rise of information technology has obscured, rather than illuminated, the operations of power in the world, and diminished our capacity to improve it. It’s brilliant and bracing. The two books I’m most excited to read this summer – almost certainly not on a beach, though you never know – are Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador), and Jacqueline Rose’s Mothers: an Essay on Love and Cruelty (Faber), which I’ve just started reading and am very much enjoying.Two recent favourites are memoirs that use other books to tell their story. Sally Bayley’s Girl With Dove: A Life Built By Books(Harper Collins) borrows voices and themes from literary classics (eg Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, Miss Marple, Milly-Molly-Mandy) to make sense of the strange goings-on in her own family. I highly recommend the author’s exuberant reading of the audiobook for the full effect of this beguiling, eccentric, funny memoir. In her joyful memoir Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading (Vintage), Lucy Mangan revisits our most beloved childhood books (Milly-Molly-Mandy crops up again), brings the characters of our collective childhood back to life and uses them – with great wit and wisdom – to tell her own story. Wonderful. Another book on the transformative power of books is Educated (Hutchinson), Tara Westover’s fascinating, jaw-dropping memoir of being raised by a survivalist scrap-merchant who doesn’t trust medicine, schools or dairy products, and tells the story of her determination to find knowledge. My summer will be spent at home, on the beaches of Cornwall, and a holiday read I’m looking forward to is Human Relations and Other Difficulties – the collected essays (1972-2015) of Mary-Kay Wilmers (Profile), editor of the London Review of Books and my old boss.I spend my life in the third person watching characters shouting from the stage, so I’m most drawn to writers who show me something different or unusually personal with a whispering voice from the page. Julian Barnes’s completely devastating The Only Story (Jonathan Cape) is as quiet and aching and intimate as a James Blake ballad. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber), the third in a breathtaking trilogy, is its polar opposite, voiceless, disconcerting, secretive and utterly modern. Finally, I’ll take John Fowles’s adolescent, deeply theatrical, classic The Magus (Vintage), which reminds me of being a teenager hoping to find holiday romance and instead seeking consolation in a book.I’m enjoying books that present as memoir but with a beauty of prose that elevates them, so I adored Jean Hannah Edelstein’s phenomenal This Really Isn’t About You (Picador), a warm and witty account of finding your feet in the face of great loss. Andrew Hankinson’s You Could Do Something Amazing With Your Life (You Are Raoul Moat) (Scribe) is another gripper, a powerful literary experiment written in the voice of the killer. On a lighter note, for my trip to Los Angeles, I’m packing Cesare Pavese’s The Beautiful Summer (Penguin), with an introduction by Elizabeth Strout, a slender account of love in 1930s Italy, and 300 Arguments and Ongoingness: The End of a Diary (Picador) by Sarah Manguso, brimming with invaluable wisdom and elegance.Holidays are for distraction-free immersion in books with heft. Artist Hito Steyerl’s Duty Free Art (Verso) is a dizzying and dystopian riff on the liquid capital that flows through the art world, the factoids manufactured by bots and our accumulation of digital debris. Counter that with Practice: Documents of Contemporary Art (Whitechapel Gallery), an anthology of essays on and by artists ranging from Marina Abramović to Gerhard Richter and their strategies for making, doing and resisting the virtual. A book that reads like magic realism but is entirely factual is Naples ’44 by Norman Lewis (Eland), a riveting and cinematic account of how Neapolitans dealt with siege and starvation – countesses transformed ballrooms into vegetable gardens or simply took to prostitution, and the cat population declined dramatically – while keeping up appearances. I will be in the Tuscan hills this summer and I am taking with me Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art (Tate) to inspire my own photographic experiments.Melissa Harrison’s forthcoming All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury) gets you in the first sentence and does not let go I cannot recommend it enough. The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken (Macmillan) is an eye-opening, funny and horrifying look at the criminal justice system, perfect for reading sections out and disrupting the lives of those around you who are “just trying to have a nice time”. I also will take These Bones Will Rise Again by Panashe Chigumadzi (Indigo), This Really Isn’t About You by Jean Hannah Edelstein (Picador), and Run, Riot by Nikesh Shukla (Hodder) with me for a week in a tent on the Isle of Wight.I heartily recommend Who Is Rich? by Matthew Klam (Fourth Estate). It’s the funniest novel I’ve read in ages and one of the saddest. The narrator, Rich Fischer, a once somewhat famous cartoonist, will please anyone who likes their protagonists clever and deluded, hopeful and doomed. I also loved Kayo Chingonyi’s debut poetry collection, Kumukanda (Chatto \u0026amp Windus). His poems are intelligent and moving and find the perfect balance between intricacy and directness. I’ve got lots of books I’m looking forward to reading on a beach in Gower: Flights by Olga Tokarczuk (Publishers Group), Hold by Michael Donkor (Fourth Estate) and Astroturf by Matthew Sperling (Quercus).Anyone who endured their teens in the 1970s as I did will devour Nina Stibbe’s sequel to the equally delicious Man at the Helm. Funny, subversive and unexpectedly touching, Paradise Lodge (Penguin), just out in paperback, follows her heroine’s adventures when she bunks off school to work in an old people’s home ripe for Thatcherite reforms. I’m always banging on about the need to read more dead authors – they have nobody marketing their work and they’re cheap and usually brilliant. Please discover Sylvia Townsend Warner this summer. Her The Flint Anchor and The Corner That Held Them (Virago) are neglected comic masterpieces whose evocations of chilly East Anglian landscapes are the perfect balm for sunburn. I’ll get no holiday as I’ve a new novel out, but on my train journeys I’ll be reading Anne Enright in preparation for interviewing her at the North Cornwall book festival.I’ll be in Berlin for most of July, heading there via – or at least in the company of – Antony Beevor’s Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944 (Viking). Always worried that I have a book too few, I’ll also be lugging Lisa Halliday’s Asymmetry (Granta), Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett (Fitzcarraldo) and Iris Origo’s Tuscan diaries, War in Val D’Orcia (Pushkin). In the second world war, the Germans used 2.7m horses, of which 1.8m died. This is just one of many moving statistics in Ulrich Raulff’s unusual and stimulating history of – and elegy for – the last 100 years of our relationship with the equine world, Farewell to the Horse (Penguin).Who Is Rich? (Fourth Estate) by Matthew Klam is a terrific summer read – a cartoonist at an ocean-side artists’ conference ponders creativity, infidelity and his own existential purpose, and the results are hilarious and bracingly intelligent. A similarly artsy but more sober read is the essay collection How to Write an Autobiographical Novel (Mariner) by Alexander Chee. Chee’s insights about writing, love and activism are hard-won, honest and incredibly wise. I can’t wait to get my hands on the new novel When Katie Met Cassidy (Piatkus) by Camille Perri. I’ve heard it’s sexy, entertaining and subversive, and doesn’t that sound like a magnificent combination? I plan to read it while visiting my sister in Providence, Rhode Island.This summer I’m fulfilling a long-held ambition to explore the mountains and cities of the Republic of Georgia by their marshrutka countrywide minibus network. On a trip that is mainly travel, I want books that will inspire me, that are humane and thought-provoking. After reading the first outstanding story, I’ve been impatiently hoarding Glen James Brown’s debut, Ironopolis (Parthian), a series of interconnected tales set on a dilapidated Middlesbrough council estate. Likewise, Mary O’Hara’s Austerity Bites (Policy Press), which reports on the frontline of austerity cuts, a book sadly as relevant today as when it was first published four years ago. The Wilderness (WW Norton) by Sandra Lim is a knife blade fashioned into a magnifying glass. Oscillating between bold declarations and restrained, seething fury, the poems slowly build to a storm in the psyche. The book is a masterclass in line-making and metaphor. It lifts me, like the best books, higher into myself. “When I come to the right place, I believe I’ll paint a door on it and  walk right through.” I’ve also been struck by Scott McClanahan’s The Sarah Book (Tyrant). It is the epitome of autofiction – and advances the tradition to include images and photographs. But more than that, it is the first book I’ve read in a while that faithfully enacts Kafka’s truism that a book must be an axe that shatters the frozen seas inside us. Brutal and unforgiving, it explores a crumbling marriage and its ensuing existential crisis through the lens of the West Virginian working class. A classic of urgent, American storytelling.Sally Rooney’s award-winning novel, Conversations With Friends (Faber), is one of the best debuts I’ve encountered. It’s a witty and entrancing read, perfect for a summer’s day spent doing nothing else. I’m hoping to visit friends in the Hudson Valley this summer I first need to finish editing my film Mary Queen of Scots – which is based on John Guy’s biography of Mary Stuart, My Heart Is My Own (Harper). For my summer reading I will e into Stephen Greenblatt’s new book, Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics (WW Norton). I love his mission to invigorate settled ideas, and it’s good preparation for the next play I’m directing, Measure for Measure at the Donmar, London.I have enjoyed The Incurable Romantic (Little, Brown), in which psychotherapist Frank Tallis opens his casebook. There have been quite a few such books recently, most of them overpraised and not as well written as their admirers claim. But Tallis writes with clarity and wit about the morbid condition of love, which emerges here as a kind of mental disorder. I have some misgivings about patient confidentiality and exaggeration andor light fictionalisation in places (Tallis has form as a horror novelist), but this is undoubtedly riveting stuff.I’ve just put down The Kiss Quotient (Atlantic) by Helen Hoang and I loved it so much I want to hand it out to strangers on the street. It’s a beautiful love story and a peek inside the life and heart of a woman who has Asperger’s or high-functioning autism. I was mesmerised by this book, which manages to be steamy hot and sweet at the same time. An American Marriage (Algonquin) by Tayari Jones is another incredible love story, though fraught with greater challenges for the couple at the centre, which makes the story all the more moving. Jones’s prose is chock-full of lyricism, grace and wisdom. You will never forget the story of Celestial and Roy. Unfortunately, there are no grand travel plans for me this season. My summer “holiday” will be stolen moments in my favourite reading chair.I read The One Who Wrote Destiny (Atlantic) by Nikesh Shukla, a beautiful, brilliant modern classic, cover to cover on one long-haul flight – take tissues! And Mr Loverman (Hamish Hamilton) by Bernadine Evaristo is the funniest book I’ve read this year, but also one of the saddest. Every character makes a perfect holiday companion. My summer travels are all work-related this year – Wales, Suffolk, Edinburgh and Cairo – so to see me through the trains, planes and buses, I’ll be packing When I Hit You (Atlantic) by Meena Kandasamy, Grime Kids (Orion) by DJ Target, Elsewhere, Home (Telegram) by Leila Aboulela and Things Bright and Beautiful (Penguin) by Anbara Salam.Sara Baume’s A Line Made By Walking (Windmill), about Frankie, who retreats from urban life and connects with nature, really made an impression on me this year. A fun and breezy read was Charlotte Bingham’s memoir MI5 and Me: A Coronet Among the Spooks (Bloomsbury), an account of her discovery that her father was a spy and of her own “inactive” service. Go Went Gone (Granta) by Jenny Erpenbeck, looking at the plight of asylum seekers as told through a retired university professor, I found very moving. My dream holiday reads include The Overstory (William Heinemann) by Richard Powers, an eco epic, with trees at the heart of the storytelling, and Ling Ma’s Severance (Macmillan), a brilliant-sounding post-apocalyptic novel, centring on the end times of late capitalism. I’ve been learning to swim this year, and while I’m in Paxos practising my strokes, I’ve accumulated some books with swimmers on the covers, and top of the pile to read is Turning: Lessons from Swimming Berlin’s Lakes (Virago) by Jessica J Lee. I recommend Territory of Light (Penguin), Yuko Tsushima’s stories of marital disappointment, parenthood and loneliness following a separation in 70s Tokyo. It’s unflinching and brings to mind Elena Ferrante’s early work. Caryl Phillips’ novel A View of the Empire at Sunset (Vintage), about the becoming of Jean Rhys, fully inhabits the despair of damp prewar London and stifling colonial society abroad. Edouard Louis’s History of Violence (Harvill Secker), detailing a sexual attack and its aftermath, is shocking, but also tender in its examination of class difference and queer desire. Books I’m packing for Arles include Annie Ernaux’s The Years (Publishers Group), Will Ashon’s forthcoming Wu-Tang epic, Chamber Music (Granta) and Nikesh Shukla’s The One Who Wrote Destiny (Atlantic).I’ve been travelling over the last month and I’ve been bouncing back and forth between books during my travels. The first is called Iron Ambition: My Life With Cus D’Amato (Sphere) by Mike Tyson and Larry Sloman. I’m a fan of Cus D’Amato, who also trained world champions Floyd Patterson and José Torres. I’m also reading Nietzsche for the first time, partly because Cus had Mike reading Nietzsche at 15 years old. I’m halfway through Thus Spake Zarathustra (Wordsworth) and will admit I can’t make head or tail of some of it. I think the book is telling me to believe in myself, to think at a higher-than-average level, and to not get bogged down with petty things. Ideal holiday reading.Anybody who wants a real treat must read Martina Evans’s Now We Can Talk Openly About Men (Carcanet). Full of insight and humour, it tells the story of two women’s lives in Ireland during the civil war. As a poet, Evans’s ability to choose just the right word is unerring. I also highly recommend Maggie O’Farrell’s I Am, I Am, I Am (Tinder), a memoir that rivals the beauty of her novels. My own summer holiday will be spent in Sweden doing research for a book. While there, I plan to reread some old favourites – starting with Tom Wolfe’s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (Vintage).Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber) is one of the most astoundingly original and necessary books I’ve ever read. It made me laugh, think and cry. She’s my friend, but I recommend it without apology: I envy anyone who hasn’t read it yet. I was startled, but also very moved, by the almost abrasive directness of Rose Tremain’s memoir Rosie (Chatto \u0026amp Windus). It did exactly what memoirs ought to do: made me want to rush straight back to her fiction. My ideal holiday (a bit of a fantasy at the moment) would therefore be a fortnight in Rome with all of Tremain on a Kindle, along with John Updike’s Rabbit (Penguin) quartet – which people have been ordering me to read for years – as well as Motherhood (Harvill Secker) by Sheila Heti, which I’ve been hoarding, and Never Anyone But You (Corsair) by the unfailingly brilliant Rupert Thomson.I know it sounds a little sad, but I tend to get really excited when I receive the Polity Press’s new catalogue. They publish so much clever, challenging and fascinating stuff. Over the summer I plan to read Alain Corbin’s A History of Silence (Polity). Corbin writes sparely, beautifully and with an exquisite fastidiousness about, well… something and nothing: quiet. In the first chapter he recommends George Rodenbach’s The Bells of Bruges (Dedalus) and Max Picard’s The Flight from God (St Augustine’s Press). I intend to consume all three of the above, at home or on trains, in an atmosphere of gentle reverence.Luis Alberto Urrea’s The House of Broken Angels (Little, Brown) is a great American novel, if we understand “America” to be all of the Americas, including Mexico. It’s profane, funny and moving. Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman (Portobello) takes a universal space, the convenience store, and turns it into the setting for a darkly comic (and very short) novel about alienation and identity in an urban, capitalist society. Alexander Chee’s How to Write an Autobiographical Novel (Mariner) is a collection of essays about race, writing, politics, queerness and sexuality that is urgent and insightful. I’ll be in Paris for much of the summer, and I’ll be taking Édouard Louis’ The End of Eddy (Vintage), Leila Slimani’s Lullaby (Faber), Han Kang’s The Vegetarian (Portobello), Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko (Head of Zeus), Lisa Ko’s The Leavers (Dialogue) and Jenny Zhang’s Sour Heart (Bloomsbury).This year, I’m packing José Saramago’s novels - I’ve only just got round to him, and I’m knocked out by the worldly precision and the combination of substance and grandeur. The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis (Vintage) was a revelation, and I’m looking forward to the half dozen more now in a pile. The two new novels I really want to take away are both by favourite Australian authors: Michelle de Kretser’s The Life to Come (Allen \u0026amp Unwin) and Tim Winton’s The Shepherd’s Hut (Picador). They’re both writers of wonderful freshness and energy. Just right for two weeks’ retreat at an Austrian health farm, to fit in between forest walks, massages, advanced treatments and 650 exquisitely tantalising calories a day.One of my favourite books this year was Nine Island (Catapult) by Jane Alison, which is funny and wise and such a closely observed account of a single woman’s life during her time living in Florida. It’s so vividly described that I didn’t read it as fiction, which shows how good a writer Alison is. Her protagonist J’s reflections on sex, love and other people are so unapologetic and honest, I felt less alone and freakish while reading the book. Another that had me in its grip, due to her insightful and direct voice, was Kudos (Faber) by Rachel Cusk. Cusk has a piercing intellect but demonstrates it through perspicacity, not by showing off on the page. I came to the graphic memoir Persepolis (Pantheon) by Marjane Satrapi via my 19-year-old daughter. It is set in Iran around the Islamic revolution when the author is 10. We accompany her through her gradual awakening to politics, love, oppression and the complexity of families – and her drawings are enchanting. I am going to Hastings, East Sussex, for a week’s course at the art school. The books I’ll take with me are Motherhood (Harvill Secker) by Sheila Heti, and Zadie Smith’s new collection of essays, Feel Free (Hamish Hamilton).Ponti (Picador) by Sharlene Teo is a sultry, hilarious dissection of mother-daughter relationships, and the effect of time and teenagehood on friendships, against the backdrop of Singapore B-movies. It oozes confidence. On Michael Jackson (Granta) is Margo Jefferson’s excellent, empathic take on the singer, encapsulating the pressures of being a child star, the most famous person on the planet and having a complicated legacy that can sometimes make people forget about the music. Meanwhile, Crudo (Picador) by Olivia Laing is a hot and heavy look at post-Brexit Britain through the eyes of newlywed Kathy as she summers in Italy. It’s Olivia Laing’s fiction debut and is very much a self-assured interrogation of the times we live in. James Smythe’s I Still Dream (Borough) is his most accomplished work – a past, present and future of AI, which is as human as it is otherworldly, and utterly engrossing. I am going to east Devon and will be taking the short story collection Heads of the Colored People (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Nafissa Thompson-Spires, the memoir This Really Isn’t About You (Picador) by Jean Hannah Edelstein and Londoners (Granta) by Craig Taylor.Don Paterson’s wonderfully learned The Poem: Lyric, Sign, Metre (Faber) is pure joy for footnote freaks and those who like to get high thinking about thinking. Not so much about how to be a poet as how to be in a poem, or even be a poem, it also works as a great book about music. DG Compton’s The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe (Gateway), written in 1974, coolly anticipated society being occupied with reality TV, and continues its journey from depicting an imaginary world to approaching nonfiction. I’ll be in Lisbon, switching between Shirley Collins’s All in the Downs (Strange Attractor) and Lamont Hawkins’s Raw: My Journey Into the Wu-Tang Clan (Faber), to see what they have in common. I’ll also be taking a handful of those nourishing one-pound Penguin Modern classics so I can go on holiday with George Orwell’s Notes on Nationalism, Albert Camus’s Create Dangerously, James Baldwin’s Dark Days, Kathy Acker’s New York City in 1979 and Samuel Beckett’s The End.This summer I’m going to Krakow for a residency and I’m taking The Idiot (Vintage) by Elif Batuman, a brain-meltingly funny Bildungsroman about communication breakdowns in the dawn of the internet era. I’ve already read it twice, but can’t bear to be without it. I’ll also be taking See What Can Be Done (Faber) by Lorrie Moore, my favourite short-story writer’s collected nonfiction, and The New Animals (Victoria University Press) by Pip Adam, the breakthrough New Zealand novel of 2017, which is about the generational ide, the fashion industry – and I can’t say more or I’ll ruin the ending. It’s ambitious, compulsive and strange as all hell.I’m going to New York and Lisbon this summer and I’m going to reread Maya Angelou’s The Heart of a Woman (Virago). I like these simple stories of people’s lives and experiences. The book gives you an insight into the intelligent, passionate woman that Angelou undoubtedly is. I will also take Edith Jackson (Puffin) by Rosa Guy. I have a really old library copy. It’s a story documenting the life of one girl in America with more than her share of life’s challenges. Nicole Dennis-Benn’s Here Comes the Sun (Oneworld) was the first Jamaica-set book I read. As a Jamaican woman, that was really exciting. It follows three women: two sisters and their mum. The older sister is navigating sexuality and being a queer woman, the younger is battling identity, being a darker-skinned girl, bleaching. It’s really addictive.I’m heading to Savoie in the French Alps. I’m taking South Atlantic Requiem (Arcadia) by Edward Wilson, one of my favourite spy novelists, and I Hid My Voice (Abacus) by Parinoush Saniee, an Iranian novelist, which is about a patriarchal family that is symbolic of the Iranian regime. I’m rereading George F Kennan’s Realities of American Foreign Policy (WW Norton). Written in 1954, it feels relevant again, given what’s happening now between the US and Russia. I’d also recommend Princess Bari (Periscope) by South Korean author Hwang Sok-yong and Thinner Than Skin (Jacaranda) by Uzma Aslam Khan, a Pakistani-American novelist. Both are wonderful in so many ways.I’m just back from the inspirational Worlds festival at the National Centre for Writing, Norwich. I came away laden with books and have already finished three of them. The Swan Book (Constable) by Alexis Wright is a devastating dystopian vision of a future Australia. I thought Behold, America (Bloomsbury) by Sarah Churchwell both brilliant and painfully timely, while Panashe Chigumadzi’s These Bones Will Rise Again (Indigo) is an extraordinary and thrilling history of Zimbabwe, culminating in the overthrow of Robert Mugabe. If you holiday anywhere near water, do take along the newly reissued edition of Charles Sprawson’s classic Haunts of the Black Masseur (Vintage). I’ll be rereading it between swims in Hydra in Greece.Peter Carey’s A Long Way from Home (Faber), Ian Brown’s The Boy in the Moon and Zadie Smith’s essays Feel Free (Hamish Hamilton) would all make perfect holiday reading. Meanwhile, my own stack of summer books include The Unaccompanied (Faber) by Simon Armitage, Untitled (Mainstream) by Carol Ann Duffy, The Bonniest Companie (Picador) by Kathleen Jamie, Jackself (Picador) by Jacob Polley and Don’t Call Us Dead (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Danez Smith. I’ll be carrying these gorgeous volumes back and forth between my New York City apartment and my old farmhouse upstate.Anyone who has the slightest interest in politics has to read Tim Shipman’s Fallout (William Collins), the follow-up to his thrilling referendum account, All Out War. Holidays may be about escapism, but this fly-on-the-wall unravelling of the 2017 election is car-crash exhilarating. For a made-up thriller, though, I enjoyed returning to the world of George Smiley in John Le Carré’s A Legacy of Spies (Penguin) in an age when the global distrust of the cold war feels unnervingly prescient. I’ve also been deeply moved and inspired by Didier Eribon’s Returning to Reims (Allen Lane), having missed the stage adaptation at the Manchester international festival last year. It’s an autobiographical account of the young gay author’s journey back to his working-class, industrial French town.The stories in Neel Patel’s If You See Me, Don’t Say Hi (Flatiron) are perfect bitesize morsels for the beach, travel legs or quiet moments. Mackenzi Lee’s Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue (Harper Collins)is a giddy whirlwind romp of a love story I can’t wait for the forthcoming sequel. Rebecca Solnit’s Hope in the Dark (Canongate) is an argument for continuing to take action, even when everything feels uncertain, and will send you back home from holiday ready to carry on. I’m going to London with my family, and bringing Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me (Text), Justina Ireland’s Dread Nation (Balzer \u0026amp Bray) – zombies plus the American civil war plus a fierce female fighter – and an advance copy of Edward Carey’s forthcoming Little (Aardvark Bureau), about the girl who grows up to become Madame Tussaud.I’d recommend the recently republished Faces in the Water (Virago) by Janet Frame. She’s a true original, her work is a joy to return to, and it never ages. Kintu by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi (Oneworld) is a great, big, roaring Ugandan epic that follows the trials and tribulations of the Kintu clan from the 1750s to today. I’m taking poetry, too: it travels light and packs a punch. I’ll include Us (Faber) by Zaffar Kunial, a poet whose work thrills me, who makes you return to the origins of things, places, language and people again and again. He’s a poet who takes traditions seriously but makes of them something entirely new – a must. I’m taking Gerda Stevenson’s fabulous Quines (Luath) – the old Aberdonian word for women – which takes us through a vivid, moving history of outstanding Scottish women in poetry. It’s a groundbreaker of a book, rich and resonant, strong of voice. I’m going to go back to Eigg, an inspiring island run by its own people, and I’ll daytrip to Muck and Canna just cos I canny not.My first recommendation is The Wood: The Life and Times of Cockshutt Wood (Doubleday) by John Lewis Stempel. It is a glorious evocation of the rhythm and dynamism of an English woodland, connecting us to a much longer timeframe: a needed balance to the working, urban lives most of us have. My second is Audre Lorde’s Your Silence Will Not Protect You (Silver), the collected essays of this important poet, writer and intersectional feminist. It is a book of our times, not least because it reminds us that current issues of gender, race and power have been being contested, here in incandescent and penetrating prose and poetry, since the 1960s.I will be spending my summer break being very quiet indeed in the Kent countryside. I shall take a pile of books including Stuart Hall’s Familiar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands (Penguin), the posthumous memoir by this vital cultural theorist Colm Tóibín’s The House of Names (Viking) Nan Shepherd’s The Living Mountain (Canongate) and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus (Fourth Estate). I’ll also be remembering Manchester, my home until last year, with Dave Haslam’s wonderful biography, Sonic Youth Slept on My Floor (Constable), and rereading Ursula Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness (Gollancz) and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale (Vintage), to feel again their potent, timely power.The Stopping Places: A Journey Through Gypsy Britain (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Damian Le Bas is the perfect accompaniment to any holiday in the British Isles. It maps a secret world, and made me want to live outdoors, at least for a summer. I’m going to Folegandros in August, and I plan to take Lara Pawson’s jagged, stunning meditation on war, violence and love, This Is the Place to Be (CB Editions). I’ve read it once and it was like drinking lightning I can’t wait to rip through it again. This summer I’m staying home so I’ll be reading around current erratic obsessions, mostly translated fiction and Trump. The recently published Call Me Zebra by Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi sounds mad and tricksy. Moroccan writer and film-maker Ahmed Bouanani’s The Hospital, a short hallucinatory novel is appearing for the first time in English translation by Lara Vergnaud. Also, Mistaken Identity by Asad Haider, which deals with class and race post-Trump, and I’ve been eagerly awaiting new translations of Brazilian writer Machado de Assis. A new complete collection will be published later this month translated by Margaret Jull Costa and Robin Patterson.What books are you reading this summer?

Modestly higher official borrowing costs are needed to prevent the economy from overheating.This, of course, is exactly what Threadneedle Street was saying three months ago. Back then it had convinced the City that a May rate increase was pretty much a done deal but then got cold feet as weak economic data from the first three months of 2018 poured in.The U-turn damaged the Bank’s credibility, which explains why the recent hawkish noises emerging from Mark Carney and some of the other eight members of the monetary policy committee have been largely ignored by the markets.The argument for a rate rise goes like this. For almost a decade the Bank has been providing colossal stimulus to the economy. Interest rates have never been lower and the boost from cheap borrowing has been supplemented by quantitative easing (increasing the money supply by any other name).This was needed because the deep recession of a decade meant there was oodles of unused capacity in the economy that would not have been put to work without the monetary stimulus. But that spare capacity has pretty much been used up and, as a result, there is a risk that inflation will start to rise unless policy is tightened.However, the Bank also said it expected inflationary pressures to build in the labour market because the lowest unemployment rate for more than four decades would force employers to pay more in order to recruit and retain workers. Here the Bank is on shakier ground.Central banks, including the Bank of England, base their judgment that inflationary pressure is building in the labour market on the relationship between earnings and unemployment first developed in the 1950s by Bill Phillips. The traditional Phillips curve showed that as unemployment came down, workers found it easier to negotiate higher pay deals. When joblessness went up, workers reined in their demands. Unemployment is at its lowest since 1975, so earnings growth should be picking up. If it isn’t there can only be two realistic explanations: the inflationary surge will eventually happen and has simply been delayed or there is more slack in the labour market than the headline unemployment rate would suggest.In addition, the pair say that workers are frightened in a way they weren’t before the Great Recession and have less bargaining power than they once did. The Bank is gearing up to raise interest rates because it thinks unemployment is poised to fall below the level at which it will start to generate inflationary pressure (usually called the natural rate or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). However, Blanchflower and Bell assert that the natural rate or the NAIRU is actually a lot lower than the Bank believes.Employment rates and participation rates can rise, and unemployment rates can fall and by a lot. Globalisation has weakened workers’ bargaining power. Migrant flows may have put downward pressure on wages and greased the wheels of the labour market as their presence increased mobility. The decline in the home ownership, which slows job creation and increases unemployment, has helped mobility and lowered the natural rate.”Of course, it is possible that the hawks on the MPC are right and that Blanchflower and Bell are wrong. Sooner or later, wage inflation will inevitably pick up if unemployment continues to fall. But it is worth saying that the Bank has been consistently wrong about the labour market while Blanchflower and Bell have been consistently right. Carney needs to be careful not to go down in history as central banking’s version of the boy who cried wolf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfcd179895dbbd14951d2dd73207f9f58e3d87b5/0_206_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d1ac85daf5f6c655783d5c622fb02f5","title":"premier foods shareholders back revolt against ceo gavin darby","story":"Investors plan to vote against Gavin Darby at upcoming annual general meetingTwo major shareholders have backed a revolt against the chief executive of Premier Foods, making it increasingly likely Gavin Darby will be forced out even if he survives an investor vote next week.Darby has come under fire from the activist group Oasis Management, the second-biggest shareholder in the company behind household brands such as Mr Kipling, Angel Delight and Bisto. Orkun Kilic, a portfolio manager at Paulson, told the Sunday : “The company desperately needs new management who are willing to put stakeholders’ benefits first and we hope this upcoming AGM will be a reflection point.”Another top-10 shareholder told the newspaper: “We plan to vote against Gavin Darby’s re-election. After the failed McCormick bid, we don’t think he can be trusted.”Since taking charge in 2013, Darby has chipped away at Premier’s debt mountain – a hangover from an ill-judged acquisition spree in the years prior to the financial crisis.Before he joined, the company had sold off brands including Hartley’s jam, Sarson’s vinegar and Branston pickle to cut debt. In 2014, Darby led a £1.1bn refinancing that included a deeply discounted rights issue, which raised funds from shareholders. Premier’s chairman, Keith Hamill, has defended Darby and argued tough market conditions mean it is the wrong time to sell off more brands. Oasis has suggested the Batchelors brand could fetch more than £200m. Hamill, who will hold a final round of shareholder meetings this week, has said Premier is a “well-run business”. With the Darby camp propped up by Nissin and the support of the shareholder advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS, the outcome of the meeting is expected to be close. However, a major shareholder vote against Darby would make it difficult for him to continue as chief executive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f62ded8e6b84467ef09eb55daf21400565e19d17/20_112_2969_1781/master/2969.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0caa731b4dfbd1be550d1e0120510f0b","title":"uk gdp data to be published monthly for higher quality figures","story":"New model from ONS should improve the economic growth picture for policymakersBritain will this week become one of the first major developed economies in the world to publish economic growth figures on a monthly basis. Starting from Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics will produce estimates for the monthly growth in gross domestic product (GDP) alongside a range of other statistical indicators for the health of the British economy.Although not without shortcomings, GDP is widely used by decision-makers in government and business as one of the best measures available for assessing the wealth of the country and the living standards of people in the UK. Unpaid care and volunteering are among several pieces missing from the picture, while the metric also fails to capture the different experiences of the economy felt between rich and poor.GDP is calculated by adding together three elements: all the money spent on goods and services across Britain, minus the value of imports, plus the value of exports the money earned through wages and profits and the total value of all goods and services produced in the UK.Matters concerning the economy have become increasingly significant in recent decades – not least since the financial crisis and as Britain leaves the EU – making better-quality and more-timely official data more important.Under the old, outgoing arrangement estimates for GDP were published once every quarter after a delay of almost a month. Each release at the end of the quarter was then followed by several revisions as more data became available to the ONS.The first estimate contained only half of the data available to statisticians, with much of the detail for the third month in the quarter based on forecasts. The ONS said its new model will use a significantly higher data content, which should improve the picture for policymakers.Writing in a blog on the ONS website, James Scruton, the head of GDP data at the statistics body, said: “While this might seem like a small change, monthly GDP will mean higher-quality and quicker estimates of our changing economy, ensuring policymakers have the important information they need to take vital decisions.”The first batch of monthly figures are likely to show economic output recovering from a sharp slowdown earlier this year after heavy snow and freezing weather blew the economy off course, which could help the Bank of England to raise interest rates from as early as August.The ONS estimates of monthly GDP will come with a two-month lag, meaning the figures will cover the three months to the end of May. However, that will still be quicker than having to wait until the end of each quarter.Garry Young, the director of macroeconomic modelling and forecasting at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said politicians and central bankers needed to know what is actually happening to the economy in real time if they are to make good decisions.There are some drawbacks, however. “A downside of the new monthly data is that it will be volatile, subject to revision and may sometimes give a misleading steer,” Young said.“That means that policymakers and other users will need to make sure they do not overreact to the latest data, unless it is confirmed by a range of other evidence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df917ea1a9893cf22934c796c220ab8a34020cc9/0_19_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7952d74839ebe2c8b540367d95820717","title":"england world cup glory patriotism gareth southgate","story":"The first World Cup I was old enough to enjoy was Italia 90. My father managed to find a barely functioning printer in his office, printed out a faded copy of the fixtures on flimsy paper and sat at the dining table, highlighting all the matches that he wanted to see. He quickly lost track of what was happening when and asked me to take over. Once I had worked out the time difference between Italy and Sudan, I was hooked, and my World\u0026nbspCup admin job grew and grew. Each day I updated the sheet, faithfully writing down which teams had qualified and who they would play in the next round. I counted the number of goals per striker, and even the yellow and red cards for each team and player.The faded fixture list became a sacred text, though one that was falling apart and smeared with food and thumbprints. The World Cup became a bonding ritual of our relationship every four years. We supported teams on completely arbitrary and random grounds, as we had no national or rational connection to them. When people asked my father why he cared so much, even though he was not particularly interested in football, he would say: “This isn’t football. This is the World Cup.”That was the way I was taught to watch the footballing carnival that is gripping our nation – by a man who had no skin in the game, just a passion for the competition and what it represented. But when you do have a team and a country to support, it can feel like a supreme moment of collective bonding.I’ve watched England matches with strangers on the street through the windows of a closed betting shop where staff had left a television screen on before going home. I have stood on chairs in pubs so packed it was impossible to get a good view. This glorious World Cup in a baking hot summer has been a festival of togetherness. For the quarter-final against Sweden, my local pub was packed with faces from the neighbourhood. People with whom I had only exchanged the occasional hello became, in the World Cup calculus, family for the day.And England won! The team is, amazingly, in the semi-finals and we get to extend our group hug moment for a little while longer. Just one note of caution, though: let’s not try to draw from this moment of sporting pride a lesson about Where We Stand As a Nation.In England we tend to overindulge in another national obsession alongside football – the neurotic attempt to get to the bottom of what it means to be English. Any major national event – and especially a World Cup – is vulnerable to scrutiny through this lens. Nigel Farage’s patriotic posturing has been justly hammered on social media. Others have argued that the team, including as it does a significant number of black or mixed-race players, is acting as a showcase for a erse Britain. But they aren’t really reading the room either. It’s great that this should be so, and it’s a point, but it’s not the point. Events such as the World Cup create an energy that cannot be replicated, created or destroyed, no matter how hard one tries. Healthy patriotism cannot be confected. In its spontaneous forms it is to be welcomed, but the moment always passes.When our politicians are fresh out of ideas at best, or behaving like mendacious cynics at worst, and Brexit has instilled a nervous insecurity about nationalism, it’s tempting to try to read something into how the country is being galvanised by this team. It’s tempting to look at Gareth Southgate and remember for a fleeting, painful moment what it feels like to admire someone in a leadership position to look at the young (so young!), eager faces of the England players and hope that their skill and swagger signifies some sort of renewal of a confident vision of the country.But we have been here before. The London 2012 Olympics felt like a turning point, one during which the country had finally managed to come up with a vibrant, modern and tolerant version of itself. Remember how the opening ceremony celebrated the first wave of Commonwealth immigrants from the Caribbean as they marched behind a huge model of their ship, the Empire Windrush? Remember Mo Farah, athletics hero of a erse nation? But the 2012 glow faded and some of those Windrush immigrants became victims of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” policy.Let’s just enjoy the football and England’s progress for its own sake. We should just be grateful for this glorious summer hiatus and enjoy the gifts of an event that allows us momentarily to talk to strangers. To paraphrase my father, it’s not politics, it’s the World Cup, and it’s become an amazing ride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ebc4cf5b705f75613488abbc632673dcd9b6bf/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257723e2d947c903cb1d0c45bd786fa9","title":"denver on tap are these the best brews in the us","story":"Artisan ale lovers, hop to it: with dozens upon dozens of top breweries and an annual beer fest to boot, Denver’s craft beer scene is the toast of the country. Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope. Two Rivers Winery – found near the spectacular red rock canyons of the Colorado National Monument – and the award-winning vintages of Carlson Vineyards are two of the best.United Airlines offers a seasonal, non-stop service from London Heathrow to Denver on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner – complete with high-tech cabin lighting and smoother ride technology, plus flat-bed seats in Polaris business class.

So what will men make of his footwear now that he is turning his attention to them?It’s the end of our hour together, and Manolo Blahnik is walking me out, through the grand hallway of his offices in a Georgian townhouse, when a rare silence falls over him. He is watching a courier deliver a parcel. The man has braids that are tightly bound into a green bandana that matches his uniform, and he hands over the little signy machine to an assistant with a jaunty half-bow. Blahnik is transfixed. As the door closes behind him, Blahnik allows himself a small gasp of delight, his eyes wide behind tiny tortoiseshell glasses. “Style!” he squeaks. “Everywhere!”Admiring men’s style is a new hobby for Mr Blahnik, now 75 and so established as a women’s designer that, like Madonna (who once said, “His shoes are as good as sex and they last longer”), his heels are famous enough to go by a single name: “Manolos”. “If God had wanted women to wear flat shoes,” wrote Alexandra Shulman in 1994, “he wouldn’t have invented Manolo Blahnik.” After 45 years of making women’s shoes he is opening his first men’s shop, where he will attempt to do for them what he has done for women – create fancy, fun, luxury footwear that is also remarkably comfortable. “His men’s shoes, well…” said his friend Rupert Everett, “they’re like slightly more feminine versions of the women’s shoes.”While other designers have followed fashion through vertiginous platforms and clompy soles, Manolo Blahnik’s have remained staunchly trendless – typically a modest stiletto, a patent leather Mary Jane, a bright colour, reminiscent of sweeties. And yet, fashion has come to him, whether radical design collective Vetements or young British designer Grace Wales Bonner, who has, he says, “An incredible uniqueness – immediately we got on well.” He smiles, his accent a chocolatey combination of the six languages he speaks fluently. “When I worked at the Royal College I used to end up with the freakiest of them all, the most twisted of them all.” Which, I offer, is slightly surprising considering, and I’m going to say, “you are such a part of the establishment”, or “considering your shoes cost £800”, but he finishes my sentence: “Because I’m such an old old boy, yes!”Some of his favourite customers, he adds, are those who travel for miles, leaving home at dawn to stand in line for his legendary annual sample sale. “We have queues and queues of young women who could be my great granddaughters. Four o’clock on the first train from, I don’t know where, from Wales or something. I love those women.”And they love him, too – they stop him in the street, desperate for selfies with this eccentric OAP who designs 600 shoes a year. “Werk, werk, werk,” he exclaims, then checks, “Like Rihanna?” with whom he collaborated on three collections of sandals and thigh-high boots. He always says yes to photos and autographs, slightly bemused, despite having become a household name through Sex and the City. “You can take my Fendi Baguette,” Carrie Bradshaw told a Manhattan mugger. “You can take my ring and my watch. But please don’t take my Manolo Blahniks.”He does not sleep well. There is an infectious energy that rises from him like heat. He gets migraines that make him, he whispers, dramatically, “vomit”. Night is when he works best. “In fact, by the bed I have a little box with papers and a huge wire with a pen and when I can’t sleep I write. But my dreams are not very funny, they really are not. For instance I went to see Snow White – for weeks I couldn’t sleep.” He has recurring nightmares about she-wolves from Mexican novels, strangling him with sharp fingernails. It takes him some time, upon waking, to recover. “They’re reality for me, which is horrible. And you know, I have this incredible thing about death.” His friend Anna Piaggi, the Italian style icon, used to call him every morning as they got dressed, and the other day, when the phone rang he picked it up and began to chat to her, forgetting she died in 2012. “Señor Blahnik?” said the stranger on the other end of the line. He had to sit down for a moment.There are many Annas in his life, including Wintour, who only wears Manolos, and who remembers bouncing her child on her knee in his Chelsea store in the 1970s. He had moved to the UK from the Canary Islands – that was the period he was working with Ossie Clark, and became the first man on the cover of Vogue. “I love Mrs Wintour,” he says today. “She seems cold and aloof and distant, but she’s not. She’s so ine. And Grace Coddington, though all those girls are just getting a little bit… tired.” Elsewhere, in the recent film of his life, Manolo: The Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards, Iman, John Galliano, Naomi Campbell and his great friend Mary Beard describe his artistry, the way he weaves his vast historical knowledge into his work.As well as Dickens and Flaubert, he is “obsessed” with films – the only benefit of the internet, he says, is the way it allows him to track down lost movies. Last weekend, a rare free day at home in Bath, he treated himself to an Angela Lansbury marathon, from Gaslight to Sweeney Todd. Gaslight, I mention, is being revisited today, as its story – a husband convincing his wife she is mad – has inspired a term that’s used regularly in political commentary. “Agh, everything’s political now which I find is very, very infuriating. I don’t care about politics. I don’t give a damn about those people, they’re so ugly, all of them. If they were ravishing, it would perhaps be different for me. I like physical beauty that you cannot reach, you know?”So he does think about politics? “No I don’t. I have likes and dislikes. Beauty is what’s important to me. I like statues also, that have nothing to say. Like the statues of Canova. Divine. I like things like that, that you cannot touch. The real thing is not exactly my…” He stops. He’s not interested in relationships. “I love living by myself. The idea of having to share something with anyone fills me with…” he shudders. “I mean… I don’t do well. Contact. I can’t stand – oh no – the normal functions of people. I’m very strange, actually, in that respect. Maybe I need help.” And he laughs.Has he ever had therapy? “No. I know exactly who I am and it doesn’t help you at all. Sometimes when I’m really desperate or crazy, because I have too much to do, I do my ‘mental cleaning’.” Which means returning to the authors he loves, Benito Pérez Galdós, Gore Vidal, Germaine Greer. “How wonderful she was in the 1970s, a woman with guts, saying: ‘This is what it is.’ And she’s incredible now. But now I think she’s not very healthy?” I start to reply and he talks over me. “But she is wonderful. Maybe you don’t like her. I like her. At the time it was shocking. It was too much, but it was true. Nowadays with all these stupid movements and this and that, it gets lost, her original thoughts about the freedom of a woman.”He finds peace in work. He is happiest in the factory. Elsewhere – meetings, especially – less so. “I’m not very pleasant sometimes,” he smiles, cheekily. “But I never think about me too much. When I do, I say: ‘Oh, what is going on? What is wrong? I should not do this.’ That’s why I say to you: ‘Doctors? No, thank you.’ I go to doctors a lot, but for the two crushed vertebra in my back. I have so many moods. I’m somebody who dreams a lot. I try to run away from this thing – what’s going on in the world has never been so bad as now.”His favourite people today are taxi drivers, because they talk to him. “I feel, not nostalgic, but melancholic about certain things that are gone. For instance, Bell \u0026amp Croyden used to be the most extraordinary Edwardian apothecary in London. Then I passed by the other day, and it’s like a huge empty supermarket in Dallas. This is what I really get sad and furious about. Why? Why that need to change something which was perfect? Same with Bond Street. It could be Rome, could be Rio, could be anywhere. Now it’s all Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, all that global nonsense.” And yet, he still adores England. “London is still beyond exotic to me. But I have never felt foreign here. I should, perhaps, because my language is not perfect, and my things are not what you’d call English. But I never felt strange here.”The most arresting shoes from his menswear collection are made from palm trees and raffia and come in a selection of rainbow shades. His favourite is the yellow. Suddenly, he picks up a green one, and folds it into his hand. It bounces back, perfect. The ideal, he says, is that the shoe feels “nonexistent”.We walk slowly out towards the door, past photographs of the men he was inspired by for this new reboot – travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, Gary Cooper – and that’s when he sees the courier, with his stylish bandana, and, for the first time since I arrived, stops talking.Manolo Blahnik’s first menswear store is now open in Burlington Arcade, London, manoloblahnik "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43f132b77ac0fd808aed7222b959f9341dfb0252/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd7a53f9644ffae0097b4962ada4e559","title":"summers 50 best swimsuits for her and him in pictures","story":"Grab a one-piece, bikini, rash vest or trunks and make a splash, or keep cool lounging by the pool, in stripes, polka dots or tropical prints"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862342b4af3937d1aa2690a69f296227947149f6/0_154_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a44f2641c7cb9f51f943884dd20d0331","title":"england fans russia world cup","story":"It has been a long journey, and it’s not over yet. Whatever happens now, though, the hardcore England fans who have seen every game at this World Cup feel they can go home satisfied.“Even if we go out on Wednesday, we’re happy,” said Craig MacDonald, an England fan from Sunderland who has been at all the games. “We’re playing good football, we’ve got a great manager and there’s a link between the squad and the fans, and we haven’t had that for years. At the end, when they all came out to applaud the fans and clap and dance, it was great to see that.”The journey so far has not been one for those without the money or stamina for thousands of miles of travel. It started with two wins amid the midges of Volgograd and the heat of Nizhny Novgorod. Next came the strange defeat by Belgium in the exclave of Kaliningrad, in which both countries played their reserve teams, and then the intensely partisan atmosphere of Moscow’s Spartak Stadium as a Colombian‑heavy crowd cheered their physical team on, but England prevailed on penalties. Finally, the strangely flat atmosphere of Samara on Saturday, as just a couple of thousand fans of each team filled small pockets of a stadium mainly populated by locals bored at the low quality of the match, and empty seats.Up next: Croatia in the semi‑finals – and then, who knows. Whatever the result of the game on Wednesday, England will play the full seven matches at the tournament, whether the seventh is the final and a chance at glory, or the third-place game in St\u0026nbspPetersburg a day earlier.Only the most blinkered optimists among the travelling England support expected the team would last the full duration, and there have been many sheepish phone calls to loved ones, children and employers from Russia over recent days explaining that the long holiday here may well be getting even longer.Due to cost, fears of hooliganism and the current political situation, an unusually low number of England fans travelled to Russia for the World Cup and, if England do go all the way to the final, those will be able to say they saw the whole run will be few and far between.MacDonald said one friend had come to join their group for the quarter-final, persuaded by the positive reviews of those in Russia, and he had nothing but warm words for the host country and the reception they had received.“Last night was one of the best nights of my life following England,” he said, recounting the long evening in a Samara bar which had put England songs on the karaoke for travelling fans to sing together with willing locals. “It’s just been a great tournament.”He said the prospect of an England v Russia semi-final had been something of a worry, as it could have been the first potential flashpoint for fan trouble, but now that has been avoided after Russia lost to Croatia on penalties, few expect trouble to flare in the last week of what has so far been a tournament played in excellent spirits.Many England fans will surely attempt a last-minute dash to join the party. Those keen to make it to Moscow to catch England’s first semi-final since 1990 will have to be prepared to pay to do so. The cheapest direct return flights from London to Moscow leaving Tuesday and returning Thursday were priced at more than £1,000 on Sunday morning, and even a circuitous indirect route via Lisbon was £600.On Sunday, tickets for the England game were made available on the Fifa website, believed to be conditional tickets bought by Russia fans, which had become free after Russia were knocked out by Croatia. However, demand for the tickets was high and on Sunday afternoon it was not possible to purchase tickets over multiple attempts, despite the website showing availability.Already, tickets for the game are changing hands for large sums of money. Even face value for the top-category tickets is in excess of £500. Andrew Wordsworth, who saw England beat Colombia and watched Belgium against Brazil in Kazan, said he had paid about £2,100 for a pair of semi-final tickets from an “amiable Australian” he met in Kazan who said he would use the extra money to go on holiday to Ibiza.If there are any regrets among neutral fans as the tournament enters its final week, it is perhaps that the culmination will be a Europe-only affair, after Belgium knocked Brazil out on Friday. The vast majority of travelling fans who came for the tournament have left or are on their way out. The South American teams and Mexico were backed by tens of thousands of fans in Russia, unlike most European sides. With the host nation also going out on penalties on Saturday night, the passions will perhaps be turned down a dial in the fan zones and street parties of Moscow that have sprung up over the past three weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef5a266c59dc1d218000313123da8b2423fcfcd/0_210_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0e6987487fb73a927c52bd38c4377ae","title":"its coming home the meaning behind the three lions lyrics","story":"An old football refrain echoes through the streets of England as the 1996 song roars againAs many of us laid our heads to rest on Saturday night with windows wide open to offset the effects of the relentless summer heatwave, the distant call of England football fans howling “it’s coming home” may have echoed in the street outside.Many will recognise the slurred refrain as the choral lyric to the 1996 No 1 single Three Lions, penned by Scouse Britpop band the Lightning Seeds and the then-relatively baby-faced comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel.Others may more readily know the line from a run of optimistic internet memes.But the verse of Three Lions, which was released 22 years ago, has left even football-savvy younger fans a little confused.The refrain “it’s coming home”was actually a reference to the fact that when the song was released, England was hosting its first major football tournament since the 1966 World Cup. But the snippet has evolved to refer to both England’s hopes of bringing home the World Cup trophy but also the disputed spiritual home of football. The international governing body, Fifa, says football in its current form was invented in England in 1863. But earlier versions of the sport can be traced much further back to widespread countries including China.The three lions have a history going back to the 12th century, when a standard with three gold lions on a red field was carried into battle to inspire the troops. Monarchs in the middle ages were sometimes referred to as lions due to the big cat’s associated characteristics of bravery, aggression and having great hair.Then there is a reference to “Jules Rimet still gleaming” – not as some have misheard “jewels remain still gleaming”.Rimet was the longest-serving president of Fifa, who held the post for 33 years and who started the World Cup competition in 1929. The original World Cup trophy was named after him – the trophy England won in 1966.And when Skinner, Baddiel and the Lightning Seeds’ frontman, Ian Broudie, describe “that tackle by Moore and when Lineker scored” and “Bobby belting the ball, and Nobby dancing” they are making reference to the England football heroes Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles of the 1966 World Cup-winning team and the England footballer-turned-Match of the Day presenter-turned-crisps promoter, Gary Lineker.And when they sing “but all those oh, so nears wear you down through the years”, they are referring to defeats in the past including the penalty shoot-out loss at the World Cup in 1990. Since then there have been many more, including penalty shootout defeats in the 1998 and 2006 World Cups as well as in the 1996, 2004 and 2012 European Championships, which is why you would be forgiven for presuming, going by the response from some fans and some in the media, that England had won the actual World Cup and not a match in the round of 16 against Colombia.England will play their first World Cup semi-final in 28 years on Wednesday, the last time being against West Germany in 1990 – six years before Three Lions was released. Back then it was all about New Order’s World in Motion and the John Barnes rap. But we’ll save that for another article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a221f1002335997cd750898655a63d6dc8d6a361/0_226_4392_2635/master/4392.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=814e16e6cffbcb548f49e89ba5d149bf","title":"uruguay world cup example to everyone","story":"It was Italia 90 and I was in Milan for the World Cup. I had been there for three weeks and my head was full of football. I needed a moment’s peace and a double espresso, so I ducked into a small café. There were few customers and, at one end, a television showing football in black and white. I turned my back on it all and waited for my coffee in silence, thinking about nothing in particular. Suddenly, a piercing scream scared the life out of me. Something had happened. I turned around and realised that the noise was the most decontextualised goal celebration I had heard in my life. Still in shock, I saw him shouting – the “goal” not yet over. It had to be some madman. Only, it wasn’t … or perhaps it was.A Uruguayan was cheering Alcides Ghiggia’s goal from the 1950 World Cup final on the television. When he had finally finished, he approached with that Uruguayan austerity I admire so much and said to me: “Sorry, it’s just that every time I see a Uruguay goal I celebrate as if it was the first.” His name was Mario, I never forgot that half an hour we spent together and I remember him every time Uruguay score a goal on the television.” He came to mind again this weekend, watching Uruguay get knocked out of the quarter-final by France. Perhaps more importantly, he came to mind watching Brazil get beaten too.I adore Uruguayan football and those expressions of love for a game that always feels like an amateur pursuit with them, even if they’re lifting the World Cup. The achievements of Uruguayan football take on a glorious dimension. The names of the stages on which they wrote their history echo in the memory like a drum on a battlefield: “Colombes”, “Centenario”, “Maracanã”. Just recalling the names of heroes such as José Nasazzi and Obdulio Varela builds statutes in shorts.But let’s bring Obdulio down from his plinth for a few minutes so that we can see what these heroes are made of. They called Obdulio “El Negro Jefe”, The Black Chief, but also “Vinacho” because of his love of red wine. Ordinary people, humble, brave, with little formal education, whose dignity was not for sale. One day at Peñarol they found out that Obdulio had no fridge at home, so his club sent him one. But that day “Vinacho” was sober and he sent it back saying that he hadn’t asked for a fridge from anyone.When the most epic moment of Uruguayan football came, the famous Maracanazo, his figure took on heroic proportions. “There are 11 of them and 11 of us too” he told his team-mates in the tunnel, adding: “they’re made of wood”. Outside were 200,000 Brazilians who had no doubt that glory awaited them that day. But glory awaits no one. You have to go and find it. Legend has it that in the silence after Uruguay scored, Obdulio could be heard asking for “more blood”. Given that every time we talk about Uruguay we talk about Garra Charrúa, that warrior spirit, it is appropriate to clarify here that the blood he demanded was that of his team-mates, not his opponents. There is mythology too, the tales are not always entirely true: this Uruguay team in Russia has again demonstrated that.In the midst of that surreal atmosphere, described as the “Waterloo of the tropics”, Ghiggia scored the goal that my friend Mario celebrated, for the umpteenth time, in a café in Milan. A small country, proud in the best sense of the word, with players for whom humility appears to be a profession, continues to pay tribute to those who laid the first stones in the edifice of Uruguay’s footballing glory, and in the best manner imaginable: by imitating them, or trying to.Obdulio was the incarnation of a great player. To define what it is that makes a great team, you need only hear the story of Jorge Fucile during the 2010 quarter-final when Uruguay played Ghana. Fucile offered to sacrifice himself, volunteering to take the place of condemned man and cause celebre Luis Suárez. You will remember it: in the last second of the game, Suárez reached out with his hand to make a save on the goalline. Penalty, red card. With swift reflexes sharpened over thousands of games on the street, Fucile approached the referee and said: “You’re right, sir. It was me: send me off.” It didn’t work but that’s not really the point. The theory says that to be a true team-mate, you have to be prepared to subsume your iniduality into that of the group, to put yourself at the service of the collective. Fucile did something that goes well beyond that: he was prepared to sacrifice the natural desire for glory that every footballer feels at a World Cup because he understood that Suárez was more necessary than he was in that battle and, if it came to it, in the next battle too. Ghana missed the penalty and Uruguay went through.In 2018, Uruguay are still Uruguay. At this World Cup, they were the same collective they always were, a lesson in life and in defeat too. They appeared at the team hotel in shorts and flip flops, drinks of mate in hand. I feel admiration every time I see the first team to encounter footballing glory living with such extraordinary normality. Extraordinary and normality might seem mutually contradictory terms, but in this case and in these times they go together because remaining so normal having reached a footballing level this high is an almost heroic feat. And this is a subject worth pursuing. Given that more than one team departed the World Cup because of the sin of frivolity, afflicted by something approaching vanity, Uruguay pose a question: could it be that humility is more important than we think?They have departed now, it is true, knocked out by France. But they did so on the same day as Brazil – a nation of three million against a country of 208 million. None of the countries in the Americas that dwarf them outlasted them. This is a loss, yes. But it is a lesson too. Uruguay are different, unique. They may lack the resources that others on the continent have in abundance, but they have something that those nations do not, that the rest could benefit from embracing. That allows Uruguay to compete, yet it goes beyond the pitch. It is lasting.The first person raising the flag of normality is Maestro Tabárez, a likeable leader. When he finds himself before a group of players, rather than an exhibition of power, the only means of leadership acceptable to him is one founded upon knowledge and a strict sense of justice. And justice can only be imparted through meritocracy. Tabárez is the embodiment of the typical Uruguayan and he knows the human and professional qualities of his players like no one else after 12 years in charge. If a footballer is a man who plays, Tabárez is as concerned with educating the man as he is with educating the player. He never over-acts, never seeks to create a scene: the best example of that are his words after defeat to France: “this dream is over, others will come.” Football in its rightful place in society.This Uruguay is the proud daughter of its footballing history and its way of understanding the game. They departed having given everything: that may not be enough to win, but it is enough to know that there is no regret and no reproach. They fought for every centimetre of turf killed for every ball never felt like visitors anywhere and left the feeling that together they would go to the end of the earth. All 11 of them. And all of those on the bench too, had the rules allowed it. A real team, with class and spirit, which showed a superior talent and warrior’s ambition in both areas. In their own, Diego Godín and José María Giménez defended as if the area was sacred territory in the opposition’s, Suárez and Edinson Cavani invaded as if conquered territory was the gateway to paradise.Cavani’s absence in the quarter-final left them blind in one eye but there was not one complaint, not a single lament. Things are as they are. They were as sporting as the referee would allow them to be. And they were pacific too, as far as circumstance allowed. Godín, for example, takes the ball from you as if he had convinced you to let him. And yet it’s also true that if he hasn’t been able to convince you, he’s capable of operating on you without anaesthetic and taking it from you whether you let him or not.I have named two centre-backs and two centre forwards but the bad news, the very bad news, for their opponents is that the other seven players are also Uruguayan. It was not to be, but they came this far – as far as Brazil, further than Argentina, Colombia, Germany, Spain and Portugal. Italy weren’t even there. And when they went, Uruguay left something. A lesson. They are footballers and they are people and they got there with their play and their personality too, the history and character that built them. The identity that Mario celebrated that day and every day. If England had made the grand final against Uruguay, I have no idea what the score would have been, but I know one thing: at the end of the game they would have regretted teaching that lot how to play football."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba6e87bad7269df3ab3338da2928f19063019cc/0_118_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1c5d258458e948e6e4fa5d01436f32","title":"england into semi finals croatia end russias run world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s quarter-final win, Croatia’s punishing victory over hosts Russia, Cristiano Ronaldo transfer machinations, Croydon bus stops and baby choices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/788d75f22d0c8b1321e908446f41b618063d92f7/0_116_4084_2451/master/4084.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65664de878a89aaa3c0f812c468e1c5c","title":"dele alli england freedom world cup","story":"Rare goal against Sweden can spur the midfielder to greater heights as England’s World Cup adventure continuesThe hour-mark was approaching when Dele Alli’s moment arrived. England had pinned Sweden deep inside their own territory, patiently sizing up when to deliver the critical pass as teammates manoeuvred themselves into position and flustered opponents sensed impending disaster. It was Jesse Lingard who eventually arced over the cross and there, the wrong side of Emil Krafth at the far post, was Alli to connect sweetly with his header.The midfielder flashed a glance towards the assistant referee for reassurance that there would be no flap of a flag, before out came all those dance routines and intricate handshakes that had been in storage at this level since October 2016. Not since Gareth Southgate’s first game in charge, back in the days when the waistcoat was worn by an interim coach, and a distinctly forgettable qualifying victory against Malta, had Alli registered for his country. Now, after 13 scoreless outings and the occasional pang of doubt, not least in the buildup to this quarter-final, there was reward to cherish.He would fling his shirt into the bouncing England support behind one goal after the final whistle before sauntering from the turf, a job professionally done. “Personally, I didn’t think it was one of my better games,” he said. “It was important we had belief in our gameplan, dominating possession but being patient as well, making sure we moved the ball quickly. For the team and the country to be going to the semi-finals … it’s an amazing feeling.”It felt completely fitting that this occasion should be decorated by the midfielder’s rare goal. This had been all about a collective raising their game, a display showcasing their eagerness to graft that Harry Kane had spoken so passionately about on the eve of the match. It was a victory that had not relied upon the captain’s cold class in front of goal and came more courtesy of Jordan Henderson’s authority in central midfield and the boundless energy of the wing-backs of Harry Maguire’s utter dominance in the air and Jordan Pickford’s excellence.The success ended up appearing comfortable but it was three saves the goalkeeper summoned after the interval that deflated what little ambition remained in Swedish ranks. A first clean sheet of the tournament was his reward.Key to it all had been the energy, invariably offered by that trio of forward-thinkers hovering with menace at the lone forward’s back. That was what truly set England apart from the workaholic plod of Janne Andersson’s selection. Alli, Lingard and Raheem Sterling had stretched Sweden whenever there was a zip to England’s delivery from midfield. They were at their fluent best when the passes were slid first-time before opponents had time to adjust, the runners forever readying themselves to scuttle into space behind a wall of yellow shirts.Lingard’s form under Southgate has been revelatory, more than justifying the trust placed in him. Sterling still looks uncertain in front of goal but he spread panic in Samara, where Sweden were permanently alarmed he might infiltrate their backline and dart in behind. He should have doubled the English advantage when Henderson clipped him free in the last minute of the first period. How Alli, hovering ignored in space to Sterling’s left, his arm briefly raised as he hollered for a pass, would have craved a ball slipped square.The Spurs midfielder had needed a spark, something to kickstart his campaign. There had previously been no rhythm to his tournament through no fault of his own, other than perhaps that understandable desire to remain on the pitch a little too long in Volgograd, which served to exacerbate the thigh strain he had suffered. The injury cost him further involvement in the group stage, while the particular demands of the knockout tie against Colombia, where aggressive opponents pinned him back, meant he rarely occupied the areas where he tends to thrive for his club.Southgate had needed to coax more from the 22-year-old here and, where Alli had occasionally been sloppy up to the interval, his passing hit and miss, he thrived once pushed slightly further upfield after the break. or the first time since the opening quarter against Tunisia, England benefited from Alli at his most effective. Suddenly there was space in which to revel, sightings of goal and the opportunity for inter-play with teammates.If the management had briefly contemplated picking Eric Dier, pushing Henderson into the No 8 role, then this was vindication for retaining the faith.“We thought balls to the far post and late runs from midfield could cause them a problem,” Southgate said. “Dele’s done a super job defensively for the team over here but he’s at his best when he’s making those runs in the inside channel, as he does for his club. Here, instead of Christian Eriksen, it was Jesse Lingard providing for him.”He will be bolstered by this display. This, at last, feels like his stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a61f08a47c0eca739f89deef4264b7ed4e3fbde9/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9afe592c6a01623ce12679a02c0c129 720w","title":"world cup 2018 news and reaction as england set up croatia semi final live","story":"Stuart James is feeling the love in Russia.Philip Silver responds to Charles Antaki: “The term ‘los pross’ has long been used in the Spanish media as a way of referring to the England national team, effectively as Charles suspected it’s a mangled term relating to the fact that England were considered the ‘creators’ of the game and one of the first to have a professional setupleague.”Croatia will have Domagoj Vida available to face England after Fifa decided that a slap on the wrists was ample punishment for the defender’s “Glory to Ukraine” video.We can confirm that Fifa’s disciplinary committee has sent a warning to the player Domagoj Vida due to his video statement following the 2018 Fifa World Cup match between Russia and Croatia.“While it’s a little infra dig for Marca to refer to Roberto Martínez as ‘Bob’, what’s more incomprehensible is their rivals Mundo Deportivo’s references to the English team as ‘the pross’” writes Charles Antaki. “I’ve never seen this before in the Spanish press – or anywhere else, not surprisingly – but it may be a mangling of ‘the pros’ as in the professionals. But who knows - ‘the prods’? ‘the progs’? ‘the props’?” I quite like “the progs” Charles. It makes them sound like the football team equivalent of Pink Floyd. I’ll tell you what’s coming home, a hefty royalties cheque on Ian Broudie’s door mat. The Lightning Seeds even went so far as to play Three Lions (Footbal’s Coming Home) live at a gig in Berkshire on Friday, and having seen Broudie joyously refuse to play it at a gig in the late 90s, the love for England must be strong indeed if he gave in this time. Not everyone is obsessed with watching England in the World Cup. The attendance for Chester’s 7-0 walloping at the hands of Liverpool in a pre-season friendly in Chester yesterday was 4,396. That’s only 1,000 shy of capacity. It kicked off at 3pm and clashed directly with England v Sweden. Mind you, Tranmere have moved their friendly with Liverpool on Wednesday to avoid clashing with the semi-final against Croatia.One of the striking things about England at this World Cup has been how the team has managed to get the tone right when engaging with supporters and journalists, both written and broadcast. Gareth Southgate has spoken openly about how he wanted the players to immerse themselves in the World Cup experience as well as engage with supporters, but considering there are so many pitfalls involved in social and mainstream media, their tweets, interviews and general demeanour appears to have been spot-on. We published a video via Copa 90 less than a month ago on the toxic relationship between England players and the media that seems rather old now. And I know winning smoothes over a lot of cracks but it does seem like England players, perhaps encouraged by the manager, have learned how to judge the mood better than in previous tournaments and have opened themselves up more than ever before in terms of personality, humour and honesty. Danny Rose’s willingness to discuss depression before the tournament was a case in point and we’re now at the point where Harry Maguire is joining in with jokes about himself. Maybe Peter Crouch is England’s press advisor. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed Jorge Valdano’s philosophical World Cup columns – and today’s is another cracker. Here’s an extract: In 2018, Uruguay are still Uruguay. At this World Cup, they were the same collective they always were, a lesson in life and in defeat too. They appeared at the team hotel in shorts and flip flops, drinks of mate in hand. I feel admiration every time I see the first team to encounter footballing glory living with such extraordinary normality. Extraordinary and normality might seem mutually contradictory terms, but in this case and in these times they go together because remaining so normal having reached a footballing level this high is an almost heroic feat. And this is a subject worth pursuing. Given that more than one team departed the World Cup because of the sin of frivolity, afflicted by something approaching vanity, Uruguay pose a question: could it be that humility is more important than we think?”A bit of breaking news now that may lead to Croatia defender Domagoj Vida being banned from playing against England – and a potential World Cup final, if they win on Wednesday.Fifa is investigating a video of Croatia defender Domagoj Vida and former player Ognjen Vukojevic dedicating their penalty shootout win over Russia on Saturday to Ukraine. In the video, Vida shouts “Glory to Ukraine” in Ukrainian and Vukojevic says “this victory is for Dynamo and for Ukraine” in Croatian. Vida, who scored a header in extra-time to give Croatia a 2-1 lead and a penalty in the shootout, and Vukojevic both played for Dynamo Kiev and the latter still works for the Ukrainian club as a scout.“Glory to Ukraine” is the war cry of the Ukrainian army but has also become more widely associated with the simmering conflict on the country’s eastern border with Russia and in Crimea, which Russia has claimed since 2014, despite international condemnation. Fifa said it “is processing the different reports of the said match as well as potential evidence concerning the matter” but said it could not comment any further until it has “evaluated all information available”.Section 54 of Fifa’s disciplinary code categorically bans political slogans and anyone “who provokes the general public during a match will be suspended for two matches.” This would rule the 29-year-old Vida out of Wednesday’s semi-final against England and end his tournament.The Spanish sports newspaper Marca has suggested Roberto Martínez as a possible successor to Hierro as Spain manager. He’s already been asked about the job in Russia and understandably, he’s waved away questions, but win or lose against France, his stock has risen again. Here’s what Marca has to say. I’m a big fan of the use of ‘Bob’ in a Spanish sports daily. It isn’t surprising that his name is now being discussed to succeed Fernando Hierro as Spain coach. Belgium perfectly executed the master plan that ‘Bob’ designed on the tactics board to get his side into a World Cup semi-final for the second time in their history.”Here’s something that Cristiano Ronaldo still might win at this World Cup? The accolade of having been the fastest player. Despite being 33 years old, he’s still clocked the joint-fastest speed in the tournament so far, reaching 34km per hour when he turned on the afterburners against Spain. He also scored a hat-trick and was just brilliant in that game. Unless someone runs faster in the remaining games, he’ll have to share the record with Ante Rebic of Croatia, though. He also reached 34km per hour, against Denmark.Some other speed merchants here: Richard Morris believes we’ve missed another favourite goal at the World Cup: Ah, come on now Richard, we’re talking about England here. Surely it’s the mishit Marouane Fellaini shot in injury-time that trickles through Pickford’s legs after rebounding off Sterling’s buttocks. So who might Spain go for next after Fernando Hierro stepped down from his role as caretaker manager? It goes without saying that no longer is it easy to attract well-paid club managers to take on national team jobs and many international teams are led by coaches who have knowledge of the development set-up, Southgate and Lopetegui for example, or elder statesmen who command respect and who are not easily ruffled such as Portugal’s Fernando Santos. Might they call on Vicente Del Bosque again? Or will they promote the Spain Under-21s manager Albert Celades López. Rafael Benítez would be an interesting appointment. He’s still a few years off 60 but he’s so very adept at preparing for the one-off big games and he must surely be ready to throw his toys out of the pram at Newcastle having been given sod-all to spend since he’s been there. In any case, here’s our story on the news that Hierro has left Spain and will not be returning as director of football. Now for a change of pace. Roger Kirkby has flagged this lovely video below the line in which the Diego Maradona of woodwork, Frank Howarth, constructs an Adidas Telstar ball entirely from wood. “This is truly a work of art,” enthuses Roger. “He not only makes beautiful things, all the videographic work is his own doing too! Please watch this, you will not be disappointed.” OK Roger. My only criticism would be that I’d have preferred it to be the Adidas Tango, as I have an unhealthy obsession with that ball. But I understand the Telstar is more topical. And if World Cup balls are an obsession of yours too, you really should have a go at this quiz by John Ashdown. Thanks Rob. More on that news that Hierro has left Spain. The Spanish Football Federation has released this statement:After walking many kilometres side by side, the Spanish Football Federation and Fernando Hierro have brought their relationship to an end following the conclusion of Spain’s campaign at the World Cup in Russia.The Federation would like to place on record its thanks to Fernando Hierro for his commitment and sense of responsibility, both in taking over the national team in extraordinary circumstances, and in the manner in which he has carried out all his functions at an organisation whose doors will always be open to him.The Federation would also like to highlight the professional and human values shown by an extraordinary sportsman to whom it wishes the best of luck for the future.”So Spain need a new manager then. Maybe they should appoint Julen Lopetegui on the eve of Real Madrid’s first game of the season.And that’s it from me. Short and sweet but Gregg devoured his horse-free salad in record time so I’ll hand you back into his capable hands. Goodbye.Some breaking news now and Fernando Hierro’s time with Spain is over. Hierro took charge of Spain after Julen Lopetegui’s sacking on the eve of the tournament and had been due to revert to his role as sporting director after the World Cup. But he has now decided to step down altogether. Sid Lowe’s take on the nuclear events that may or may not have derailed Spain’s World Cup campaign makes for interesting reading …Fans of the four remaining teams are being urged to abandon their work and families for a last-minute trip to Russia. Fifa are urging supporters still at home to check the official website for returned tickets from fans of other countries. Large numbers of tickets, hotel rooms, flights and seats on trains have become available as the huge numbers of German, Mexican and South American challenges have fallen away. According to Fifa’s most recent numbers, England have only the 10th largest number of fans in Russia, but that is still the biggest of the four countries still in the tournament.Thanks Gregg, and hello one and all. I bring with me the World Cup power rankings. Fresh from a pasting for ranking England in lowly seventh place last time out, Nick Ames has donned his hard hat and thrown himself back in the line of fire. Sweden fans, look away now …I’m a bit peckish, so I’m going to grab some food and leave you in the more than capable hands of Rob Bleaney while I’m away. I won’t be eating horse, mind, just a cheese toastie. Back soon. Seeing as it was posted at around 5.40am, you may have missed news that Jordan Pickford injured a hand punching himself yesterday. He’s confirmed that he’s all right – he’s also confirmed that he is perhaps the most matter-of-fact England player there has been well, ever. It was a daft injury by myself. I went to punch the floor and ended up punching my knee and hurt my thumb. It was a bit of anger. But I’m a man, not a mouse. I’m fine and I’ll live another day, won’t I?I’m sure you will Jordan.Mick, a Lincoln City fan, appears to be suggesting that the Cowley brothers are responsible for football (possibly but probably not) coming home this summer. “Imps fan here. The ‘love train’ was absolutely nabbed from us,” writes Mick. “Think a break-off shot in pool, players hurling every which way, opposition all at sea. Then there’s that deep free-kick routine England have used a couple of times, where Kieran Trippier feigns to float it into the box then at the last moment slides it down the channel for Sterling to run on to. That’s another Cowley brothers’ thing. We scored two or three goals from that last season. Let’s hope it gets England one on Wednesday evening too …”Nikola Popara points out that we overlooked Aleksandar Kolarov’s free-kick against Costa Rica earlier. Yes, it’s good one all right. A curled free-kick seems so old-school these days. Russia’s run to the last eight might not have been possible without Sergei Ignashevich’s decision to come out of retirement before the World Cup. Russia’s defence had been a sorry shambles in the buildup to the tournament and this had not gone unnoticed by the defender, who turns 39 next week. He helped bring authority and a cool head to their defence and hammered home a couple of penalties in emphatic style too. He’s now decided to hang his boots up once more. And he retires a hero. “There’s an endless stream of messages on WhatsApp and Instagram and no way to tell everyone, ‘Thank you for the kind words’,” he wrote. “I couldn’t imagine that I would finish my football career on such a high note! I’m happy I was part of this team, with this coach, and of our country’s football for nearly 20 years.”Krish has tweeted this morning to suggest his favourite goals from this World Cup and I’ve risked turning this blog into a chart show by including them.The big omission for me in this list is Edinson Cavani’s first goal against Portugal. The long-range one-two that preceded it was just brilliant and there was something about the speed with which the ball thumped in off his head that elevated it beyond the usual cross-header goals you see. Wonderful. England fans brought a bit of 2017 humour with them to Samara yesterday.Andrew Roth has done a fine job of capturing the mood in Russia after the valiant hosts were sent tumbling out of the tournament on penalties. After Croatia prevailed on penalties, there was a shocked silence, and people began to file home, quietened and depressed. Outside the stadium in Sochi, there was something like a dialogue. ‘Smolov is a jackass!’ yelled one teenager. ‘Hey, don’t curse our guys, they gave it their all tonight,’ a middle-aged man with a ponytail said and continues on his way. ‘Igor Igor Akinfeev! Oh!’ another man yells. ‘Igor, come here I’d like to have a word with you,’ howled a woman, playing the disappointed wife, tottering down the street in heels. Her friends laughed tipsily. People have different ways of dealing with grief. “Not much mention of Jordan Henderson this morning but he has definitely been the driving force of the team during this World Cup,” cheers Bob Wilcox. “He’s very much the ‘quarterback’, from his distribution to his organisation of the set play routines.”Jürgen Klopp’s in agreement with you Bob: He’s been very mature, a proper leader in the team. You can see it. Everybody can see that this England team is offensively very skilled. And you need a few serious persons in the team to keep it all together. I like how he’s doing that. He’s still involved in all the offensive things, set-pieces and all that stuff. He’s also made a few wonderful passes. He controls the game and I really like that.His reading of the game has improved immeasurably at Liverpool in the past season. He can second-guess opponents much better than he was capable of a couple of seasons ago. If you have that ability to you can keep a little bit in reserve for when you really do have to press, which is why he is finishing games so strongly in my opinion. Also, I wonder what James Milner was thinking yesterday when he was playing in Liverpool’s 7-0 friendly win at Chester? Surely his form would have earned him a place in the England squad if he’d been available? Then again, his fine form last season was probably in part down to the fact he had his feet up when others were on international duty.This theory for why Henry is on the Belgian bench and not the French one on Tuesday is pretty interesting: Another interesting sub-plot in the Belgium-France semi is the presence of Thierry Henry as assistant manager on Belgium’s bench.Indeed. As a French fan, I think his input would have been beneficial for Les Bleus. But then, despite his heroics in 1998 and 2000 when we won two successive tournaments, maybe he has too much baggage with our national team. 2010 in particular (dubious qualification in the playoffs vs Ireland), the strike and the bus, etc.I also think he might be more enthused by Martinez\u0027s style of football than Deschamps\u0027. And I don\u0027t blame him for this.Anyway, this article in French is pretty interesting:http:www.leparisien.frsportsfootballcoupe-du-mondefrance-belgique-comment-thierry-henry-s-est-eloigne-des-bleus-08-07-2018-7811883.phpI agree that Henry must be so much more enthused by Martínez’s style than Deschamps’s and bringing in his star quality into the dressing-room to help embolden Martínez was a shrewd move by Belgium. They can’t shout “show us your medals” at Thierry. David Hills has been busy penning week four of his World Cup diary. It’s brilliant, of course. Here’s a taster:  Quote of the weekNeymar – shutting down fake news about “arrogance” and simulation before he went home. “I don’t care much for criticism … In the last two matches I didn’t talk to the press. Maybe they’re just showing off. I think it’s more an attempt to undermine me than anything else.”• Also upset by it: Brazil coach Tite – attacking “unfair” ing slurs, including remarks from Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio that Neymar sets “a very negative example to all children”. (Tite’s view in 2012 when he was Corinthians coach, recirculated online last week: “Neymar sets a bad example for children, for all those growing up. He just drops and rolls.”)“Harry Maguire and Jordan Pickford were magnificent, but can we all agree that John Stones is looking the player he has always threatened to be?” gushes Matthew Loten. “Calm and assured in the middle of the three, and a brick wall when he has needed to be.” I wonder if Pep will have taken any notice or if he couldn’t give a flying one how his players have performed under managers he probably regards as being beneath him? I read somewhere the other day that scouts are not swayed by tournament performances as much as they used to be (see Rodriguez, J, Colombia at Brazil 2014). I wonder if the same goes for managers watching squad players impress in the first team? Mind you, Pep has definitely influenced Southgate when it comes to taking risks at the back in possession for the greater good. “On the subject of the Kane Train,” begins Ken Aylmer, “the World Cup is a place to display our National characteristics so my daughter Ella thinks the English players are forming an orderly queue for the ball at corners.” Having heard him wax lyrical about repeats of 80s films on daytime TV before coming in for a late shift at the , I think it’s fair to say that Sachin Nakrani likes watching TV. So, who better placed to give an opinion on the BBC’s coverage of Sweden v England yesterday?And to answer a question in his piece, I think Frank Lampard was replaced in the BBC’s team because he’s started his job as Derby manager now. “It’s fun listening to and reading the thoughts of those who cover England,” writes David Seare. “After years of analysing failure they’re trying to explain this sudden arrival in a semi-final. It seems to me that a bit of luck combined with finding a way to score goals (the more grapple-free approach to set pieces) and a more solid-looking shape than we expected are to blame.“That combined with the happy accident of a coach who learned his business in junior international football and players selected to serve the team rather than some players picked for who they are and then thrown on the pitch to see what happens have made a refreshing change. We shouldn’t try to explain it but just ride the wave until it crashes on the shore. Logic suggests the semi-final might be the end but who knows what lies round the corner?”Here’s a suggestion: “To call England’s brilliant set-piece routine ‘the love train’ doesn’t sit well with me. Has anybody suggested ‘the Kane train’ yet?” Well, you just have Torbjorn Karlsen.But seeing as this World Cup is rapidly turning into the third summer of love, how about the Groovy Train? It’s a good excuse to post this anyway:He took his time, but Dele Alli finally came to the England party yesterday. Here’s Dominic Fifield’s take on the attacking midfielder’s display. Southgate had needed to coax more from the 22-year-old here and, where Alli had occasionally been sloppy up to the interval, his passing hit and miss, he thrived once pushed slightly further upfield after the break. For the first time since the opening quarter against Tunisia, England benefited from Alli at his most effective. Suddenly there was space in which to revel, sightings of goal and the opportunity for inter-play with teammates … He will be bolstered by this display. This, at last, feels like his stage.An now for an important question from Hubert O’Hearn: “Who should England send to sit at the right hand of Gianni Infantino and opposite Kolinda Grabar Kitarović? Theresa May in Ginger Spice’s patriotic dress? Deep down inside I’m hoping for Danny Dyer.” England’s new-found political powerhouse might be too busy preparing a thesis on Brexit, so how about Ross Kemp, with his top off, the absolute mad man? He was at it again yesterday. Obviously. “How much love do you think Big Sam would be getting if he was still in charge and England were set-piecing their way to World Cup glory?” asks Niall Mullen. “Instead of waistcoats would people be downing pints of wine in tribute?” I think plenty of England fans are doing that regardless. Maybe considering a career change to that of a firefighter would be the ultimate tribute.On the subject of kits, James Walton writes: “I thought the Fifa guidance was that the home team always wears their preferred shirt (light or dark) and thus the away team wears the opposite. If that is the case, Croatia are deemed to be the home team so should wear whitered. But I am not sure Fifa would allow that against England in either colour. So surely then Croatia must wear blackblue and England will wear the light colour (white).” I think that will be the case, though I’m sure Croatia would prefer their red and white check, which I’m a huge fan of. And for me, they play better in that kit too. Another interesting sub-plot in the Belgium-France semi is the presence of Thierry Henry as assistant manager on Belgium’s bench. It’s not often – if ever – you get a World Cup winner from your own nation plotting against you. It feels as if he should be sat around with Les Bleus telling them tales of his footballing battles of yore won rather than Belgium’s talented squad. If Toby Alderweireld’s pre-World Cup comments are anything to go by, Henry will play the role of chief raconteur over the next couple of days while Roberto Martínez wrestles with what tactics to employ.Thierry Henry is really important for us. He tells us stories from his playing days and they inspire us. If he says something, it is always turns out to be something helpful. His presence, his World Cup experience, it is all a very positive influence.What a brilliantly odd pair Martínez and Henry are. Hats off to the Belgian FA for bringing them together. I imagine there are some seriously positive vibes in the Belgian dressing room – and lots of Jason Derulo! Belgium v France is one hell of a tasty semi-final isn’t it? You could argue they’re the two strongest squads in the tournament. And while France have shown in flashes what they’re capable of it still feels as though they have more to give. As for Belgium, well, perhaps beating Brazil was their footballing rite of passage. Their counter-attacking ability is frightening and Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku are all bang in form in a way that France’s key players are perhaps not. I feel that N’Golo Kanté may have a big say in which way this tie goes. If he can stop De Bruyne, then he may limit Belgium’s ability to hurt France. Mind you, they have so many other possible tormentors, Kanté may take his “km-ran” statistics into world-record territory. “I am not sure if someone has picked this up yet. In the last two games England have conceded just three corners in total,” writes Gokul Kannan. “Colombia had Yerry Mina who had scored twice coming into the game and did score with the first opportunity he got in that game. Sweden had Granqvist who is a giant too. I haven’t looked into this in detail, and I am not sure if this has been a conscious effort by Southgate. Hell, I am not even sure if this is even possible. Planningtraining to not concede corners. But, if it is and Southgate has done this, then I am very very impressed.” You could argue that the way England look to play out from the back means they’re probably less likely to concede possession and enable opponents to run at them quite so often, which could lead to a corner being conceded. Not having a back four is possibly a factor too. The wing-back might intercept the opposition winger earlier – perhaps conceding a throw-in instead of a corner. The way Gareth Southgate has continued to encourage building from the back is the thing that has impressed me most about his coaching. So often England teams clipped the line from the full-back position and gave away possession. He’s somehow coached fear out of the team. And that’s some feat. I think Croatia’s president, Kolinda Grabar Kitarović, might be more Up For The Cup than Theresa May on Wednesday evening. This is some seriously passionate dressing-room bouncing. Morning, and thanks Jonathan. So we know who the four semi-finalists are – and they’re all European! Which is great for football in Europe but seems a shame for the World Cup, given what phenomenal support the South American nations have had in Russia. Peru, Colombia, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil’s supporters have brought colour and noise to Russia in abundance. Maybe they’ll be in attendance at the semi-finals as neutrals, or maybe France, Belgium, England and Croatia fans will be busy online procuring tickets from those South Americans who are now homeward bound. Either way, they deserve a tip of the hat.Righto, it’s time for me to hand this page over to Gregg Bakowski. Your company has been as splendid as always. I’ll catch you again somewhere like this later in the week. When Des read If at the end of France 98 it gave me goose bumps then and has stuck with me.So much of this tournament, from an English perspective, whether fan, player, media or whatever is wrapped up in this.Could anyone get away with anything like this any more?

Now she’s made a documentary on society’s obsession with extreme wealth – and its cost to us allDocumentary photographer Lauren Greenfield was trying to form trusting relationships with members of a Mayan tribe in Mexico in the early 1990s when she picked up a discarded copy of Bret Easton Ellis’s Less Than Zero. Before she’d finished the cult novel – which charts the parties, drug taking and sex lives of rich college kids in Los Angeles – Greenfield had decided to swap photography subjects from the Maya of Chiapas to the rich kids of her home town.A quarter of a century later, Greenfield has amassed 500,000 images of the often absurd lives of the wealthy. The highlights – including a picture of go-go dancers hired for a 13-year-old’s bar mitzvah – are published by Phaidon in a £60 2.5kg tome called Generation Wealth. An accompanying behind-the-scenes documentary film is released in the UK next week.Greenfield introduces us to characters all motivated by the accumulation of wealth. “No matter how much people had, they still wanted more,” Greenfield says of her subjects. We meet Florian Homm, a hedge fund manager living in self-imposed exile in Germany to avoid extradition to the US where he has been sentenced to 225 years in jail. Smoking cigars and dripping in gold, Homm, who became known as “the antichrist of finance” for ripping off his investors for hundreds of millions of dollars, tells Greenfield that morality changed in the 80s. “The value system changed completely. It wasn’t about who you are, but about what you are worth… Morals are completely non-productive in that value system.”As his hedge fund was imploding during the financial crisis of 2008, Homm, now 58, fled the €5m Majorcan villa he shared with a 27-year-old Russian lingerie model. With $500,000 stashed in his underwear and a humidor in hand, Homm boarded a plane to Colombia and disappeared for five years. We learn that he used his fortune to buy his son, then 15, the services of a Dutch prostitute. Homm was later arrested at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.One of the photos that best sums up Greenfield’s work is of the DJ, rapper and producer Lil Jon flashing a smile showing $50,000 worth of diamond and platinum dental work. There’s also the former porn star Kacey Jordan, who received $30,000 to attend a sex party at Charlie Sheen’s home. Jordan tells Greenfield of seeking greater wealth through extreme sex, which may have made her temporarily wealthier but didn’t make her happy. She made numerous suicide attempts, and ends the film in the same dead-end job she had before starting porn.Then there’s Eden Wood, six, a beauty pageant princess and star of reality TV show Toddlers \u0026amp Tiaras, who tells Greenfield “My favourite princess is me” and says beauty means “that I get money, and I’ll be a superstar.”Greenfield says the intimacy she shares with her subjects at their most vulnerable led her to consider the impact her obsession with their lives has had on her own family, and turns the camera on her sons, mother and husband. Her 16-year-old son Noah tells her: “I got used to growing up without you around. The damage has been done.”The stories Greenfield tells about rich families detached from the world around them, living in bubbles separated from reality by armies of nannies and household staff, chime with my own experiences covering the super-rich as wealth correspondent for the Observer and the . From Knightsbridge to Monaco, the Upper West Side and the Hamptons, the wealthiest people in society are richer than they’ve ever been before. More of them have five, six, seven or even a dozen homes in the world’s most desirable locations and it is not unusual for them to fly their nannies, tutors and security details between them on private jets. Their houses may cost as much as the £135m a Ukrainian billionaire paid for a penthouse in One Hyde Park, but that doesn’t mean they’ll spend much time there.The Boltons, a street of grand Victorian mansions in South Kensington, has been an address that only the very well-heeled can afford since the 19th century. But the influx of wealthy Russian and Middle Eastern families to London means prices have gone beyond the reach of all but the very richest of Brits. The average house price is a fraction under £20m – 88 times the UK average – making it the third most expensive street in the country (after London’s Kensington Palace Gardens and Grosvenor Crescent). Over cups of tea and strawberries and cream at the annual church fête held in a private garden square overlooked by the mansions this summer, locals tell me of a disconnected community. “We must be standing on some of the most expensive real estate in the world,” says David, a long-standing member of the St Mary The Boltons congregation, who lives a few streets away. “But you won’t find any of the owners at our fête. You probably won’t find any of them at home from one month to the next.”A four- storey, nine-bedroom house complete with cinema, indoor swimming pool and Japanese garden sold for £51m in 2015 to an offshore company. The stamp duty alone set back the unknown buyer £7.6m. The owner is paying £220,000 a year in extra tax in order to keep their identity a secret.Greenfield says the true absurdity of extreme wealth hit her when she was documenting the lives of the Siegel family, who were attempting to build the biggest private home in America, for her film The Queen of Versailles. When “timeshare king” David Siegel loses billions in the 2008 financial crisis, the family are forced to travel by commercial jet and one of the children turns and asks, “Mommy, what are all these people doing on our plane?” Greenfield met the Siegels after striking up a friendship with Donatella Versace, whom she met via her work documenting the lives of rich kids in LA. She went back to Crossroads, the $38,000-a-year private school in Santa Monica she’d attended alongside Hollywood’s rich and famous offspring. Greenfield says her position as an “insider and outsider” – she went to the school herself, but her parents (both academics) couldn’t afford to kit her out with the designer bling the other kids had – gave her “exceptional access to the world of the wealthy in LA”.Greenfield never wanted to become an expert on the rich or pass judgement on their lives or spending. “I wanted to be a guide, to take the viewer on a journey and to help them understand the shift in society.” She admits weeping a few times while putting the book and film together. .We meet for lunch at London’s five-star May Fair Hotel, surrounded by fellow diners who could easily be her subjects. “The photos are evidence of a sea change in our values over the last 25 years,” she says. “I felt like we had gone from the American dream of opportunity for all to a desire for ever more wealth, in the currency of money, fame, beauty or youth.” She says it’s not just an issue that effects the wealthy, but everyone in society. “We’re all complicit in generation wealth.” Greenfield interviewed several experts for the film, but just one survived the cut. Former New York Times journalist and leftwing activist Chris Hedges is quoted as saying “Wealth is whatever gives us value” and warns that “Societies accrue their greatest wealth at the moment they face death.” This last remark might trouble Americans in particular: last year Professor Philip Alston, United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty, made a statement accusing Donald Trump and the Republican party of consciously distorting the shape of American society in a “bid to become the most unequal society in the world”.Alston, who acts as a watchdog on extreme poverty, said Trump’s administration had passed tax laws that “overwhelmingly benefitted the wealthy and worsened inequality”. He said Trump’s policies “seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment and make even basic health care into a privilege”.But Greenfield says the chasm between rich and poor was widening well before the reality TV star’s 2016 election. “The American dream – that everyone has equal opportunity – became a fiction long before Trump,” she says. “Americans don’t hate the rich, as they imagine they could become the rich. They don’t want high taxes as they think they could become rich and won’t want to pay them. But what they dream of is an increasingly unbelievable fantasy.”She says that while examining her photos it became clear to her that “We have left behind the American dream of my dad’s generation where there was the possibility of social mobility and the belief that anyone could make it. The things that were valued then – discipline, hard work and frugality – are not so important now. We have a culture that prizes celebrity, bling and narcissism.” Trump, she says, “is the apotheosis of generation wealth. With Trump you have wealth and celebrity achieving the ultimate goal. Trump is the natural evolution of the values of our culture.”When Greenfield started the photography series – which includes portraits of a 12-year-old Kim Kardashian – getting permission from parents to document their kids’ lifestyles sometimes proved difficult. “The parents wanted to be a little discreet – they indulged in the lifestyle but didn’t necessarily want to be seen doing it, but that has changed,” she says. “I went back again in 2007 and the parents’ attitudes had completely changed. A lot of times parents would be present at the interviews and they would be proud, saying: ‘Our kids are just like Paris Hilton.’”“‘Keeping up with the Joneses’ has become ‘keeping up with the Kardashians’,” she says as we tuck into seared tuna with caponata and gambas al pil pil. “Instead of wanting the slightly better house down the street, you want the mansion that Kim has. Reality TV and social media has made the lives of the wealthy more accessible, and it has made people hungrier for it.” The children Greenfield met were sometimes more aware of the potential damage created by free flowing cash than their parents. She recalls a 13-year-old called Adam who told her: “Money ruins kids, money has ruined me”.Greenfield went to Adam’s bar mitzvah and was “blown away” by the scale of the production, including the go-go dancer. “Kids in his circle had to be seen to spend £50,000 on their bar mitzvah or they’re shit out of luck,” she says. Hanging out with Adam affected her more than most of her subjects, because even at 13 he was perceptive enough to know that something had gone wrong. She describes herself as friends with many of her original subjects, including Adam. But he wouldn’t allow her and the cameras back for her latest film.Neither would David Siegel, 83, the real estate mogul she shadowed in The Queen of Versailles. “He hates the way the film ended when he loses the houses,” Greenfield says. “I don’t think David will ever let me back.” But Siegel’s third wife, Jackie, 52, is still friends with Greenfield and attended the premiere of The Queen of Versailles. “She thinks it’s the best thing she ever did,” Greenfield says. Early on, Jackie, a former Mrs Florida beauty pageant winner, told Greenfield: “You can never be too rich or have big enough boobs.” Jackie’s breasts, which have been augmented four times, fill the frame of one photo.At the end of the film, Greenfield says the Siegels appeared to have learnt that wealth is not as important as health and happiness. But, having recovered from the financial crisis, the Siegels bought back the house and extended their ambitious plans. The house built on a man-made hill in a gated community in Orlando will have 14 bedrooms, 32 bathrooms, a 30-car garage, bowling alley, five swimming pools (three indoor, two outdoor), a two-storey cinema and a ballroom with capacity for 500 guests. The much delayed house is set to be finally habitable next year.“They had this realisation that it was family that mattered,” Greenfield says. “Yet they are back at the house building bigger and better. I wonder, did we really learn anything from the financial crash, or did we just go back to the way it had always been? In the US and the UK we fixed a broken system and now the real estate market is even more on fire, the stock market is up and Trump is the president and tax laws are making things even more unequal.”Josef Stadler, the lead author of UBS’s report, says his billionaire clients are aware of the widening gulf between rich and poor and fear that hard-pressed people might rise up and take direct action. “We’re at an inflection point,” he says. “Wealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about. The question is, to what extent is that sustainable and at what point will society intervene and strike back?”He says the “$1bn question” is how society will react to the concentration of so much money in the hands of so few. Anger at so-called robber baron families who built up vast fortunes from monopolies in US rail, oil, steel and banking in the late 19th century, an era of rapid industrialisation and growing inequality in America that became known as the Gilded Age, led to President Roosevelt breaking up companies and trusts and increasing taxes on the wealthy in the early 1900s. “Will there be similarities in the way society reacts to this gilded age?” Stadler asked. Looking back on her work, Greenfield recalls being startled by ostentatious displays of wealth but says what might have been shocking then is day-to-day reality now. In her first few days visiting Crossroads, three boys asked her what she was doing by the school gates every day. When she told them she was working on a documentary about growing up in LA, they told her it was “all about money” and pulled cash out of their pockets, posing for the camera.“It wasn’t until I developed the film that I saw that these 13-year-olds were waving $100 bills.” Generation Wealth is in cinemas from 17 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac8720bf20a951772ea627608f0d70a5529b0ce/0_191_10039_6023/master/10039.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ae88657e5ed001c00993141d9ee39e7","title":"moving house means sifting through broken toys and masses of memories","story":"Major relocations involve sifting through many boxes – and masses of personal historyI wrote an ode to clutter once. I went on about how precious it really is, anchoring us and telling our stories. What an idiot. Today you find me hoist with my own clutter petard: after 12 years in a large space in Brussels, we are moving to a much smaller one in York and everything (well, most things) must go.More viscerally, it feels wrong because I am packing up my children’s childhood when they are still – sort of – children. Our sons were two and four when we moved here now they are 14 and 16. Back then, they liked plastic snakes and tractors. Now they like… mining bitcoin? Eating laundry pods? They don’t tell me anything any more. I was shaken to discover recently that the elephant I took my younger son to see at Antwerp Zoo when she was born is a parent herself now. Time has passed, as time does.But with six weeks to go, I can’t indulge my mooning, plangent “they grow up so fast” laments. Every spare moment is an opportunity to go to the dump, tackle Wasp Cupboard (ruled by wasps since our arrival) or fill a recycling box with bank statements from the 1990s. I must address the charnel heap of toy animals discarded in my office and the drawers of lidless felt tips, plasters and plectrums. We can’t take it all and it would be madness to try: no one needs that much Lego (we don’t need any, which is unfortunate as there are at least seven pieces in every cupboard). But it feels as if I am putting away childish things too soon. This house was supposed to be our for ever home. It isn’t, it turns out, but it will always be the house the boys grew up in, and digging through everything we did, felt and brought here feels painful and premature.“Nothing,” I said, but I was wondering if I should separate the cork soles from the fabric upper half of his slippers.But I can’t terminate the house without succumbing to what the novelist Helen Garner calls “The nameless emotion… that explodes in the heart and brain of a person who is about to move house.” No one can: you’re forced to evaluate your life as you pack it up. I knew photographs would be hard so I did them first and tried to limit it to a simple filing exercise, a box for each year. Even so, I was blindsided by how much my boys used to smile: big, simple, whole-body grins. My younger son, vibrating with pride, holding a tiny violin. My elder, convulsed with laughter as a pet rat crawls into his armpit. I’m not suggesting they grind out an existence of unrelenting misery now, but oh, those smiles.Some decisions are obvious: a box of baby clothes and my personal reliquary of milk teeth, first haircut clippings, pregnancy tests and hospital bracelets will come. I will also keep a few things that have washed up here from my own childhood: books, pictures, a pedantically detailed scrapbook on sheep farming and Piglet, my longtime plush companion, grubby with age and neglect. Moving to a more recent archeological stratum, I will bring my husband’s love letters in their shortbread tin, sent the year we met. Not to read now: I’m fearful of the emotional gut punch of happy and painful memories they will set off (a recent casual sniff of the perfume I used to wear back then was bad enough), but one day…There are unexpected wild cards. I find a journal I don’t remember keeping from 2005, full of raw grief and shopping lists. One page reads “cot sheets, mini Smarties, Hula Hoops” the facing page reads: “I will never be as good as my mum, I want my mum, I don’t have the ability to be happy.” In the same cupboard, another notebook holds a few scrawled memories of my mum, still fresh back then: “We take Theo out in a stripy sleepsuit – some boys we pass in the street point and say ‘Look, a little robber!’ and it makes us laugh.” I recycle the former, keep the latter in my box of mum mementoes, with her letters. I finally resolve to part with the broken, battered handbag she was carrying when she died.But my stuff is mine to dispose of (my husband, pathologically unsentimental, has thrown everything away, up to and, I fear, including, our spare keys). The boys’ things are much harder. Packing up is peeling away the onion layers of their – our – personal history, and their things, once loved, now outgrown, transport me to the children they used to be. Softer and more vulnerable, shaped by their ever-shifting passions.There are castanets and ukuleles, magnets, marbles and an inordinate number of plastic beetles. There are reminders of gift-shop bribes: rubber swords, ammonites and an – accidentally purchased – fluffy chlamydia toy from the Natural History Museum. The dispiriting number of stocking fillers reminds me why my stepfather used to round them up discreetly in November to be rewrapped and regifted everyone is getting a charity goat and a satsuma next year. In storage crates, distinct strata illustrate a history of playground crazes: Pokémon, Pogs, Bakugans and loom bands. There are more personal mementoes, too. Louis adored this purple beanbag spider: he slept with it every night for years. Theo insisted on getting this horrifically morbid book about a snail that dies because his shell is too big, then cried about death for weeks.It’s too much. My American friend Fernanda moved out of her home of 13 years with her two sons following her orce, so I email her for advice as I feel myself becoming overwhelmed. “I was pretty ruthless,” she replies. “But my kids aren’t sentimental. I rented a dumpster (what do you call those? A scone? A fascinator?) and it still wasn’t enough. Possessions are the devil, Emma.”She may be right, but some things refuse to go gently into the bin. I come across a plastic chameleon with an oversized wobbly head and cutesy giant eyes, a sort of reptilian My Little Pony and something resonates. “This used to be the ultimate, didn’t it?” I say, waving it in front of my giant 16-year-old, who is “revising”, taking up a whole four-person sofa and looking at two screens simultaneously. He removes an earbud glances up. “Oh yeah!”“What was it called? I remember they came in packs of two and there was some awful one with it, but you insisted because we had to have the lizard.”He thinks for a moment, eyes flicking across his screens. “Littlest Pet Shop?”“Yes! Ah, you loved it so much.” I can’t quite bring myself to bin the lizard, once so precious, objectively hideous. I put it in my pocket to defer the decision.Part of the problem is remembering the parent I was at each of these stages: impatient, anxious and blundering. Back then I rarely lived in the moment: now every object unearthed makes me relive a moment and, with it, my failings. A pile of school reports reminds me of shouting at my son for so-so exam results and I burn with shame the soft toys I bought during the time their father and I separated remind me of the hurt I inflicted on all three of them. Ouch. I know we have been happy here, but sitting in the dust, those memories elude me. I am stuck rerunning a grim greatest hits of the past with a permanent lump in my throat, every drawer sparking sorrow. Marie Kondo would have a stroke.My friend Les, who has just moved out of her home of 26 years, recommends The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning for tips on how to purge without tears, but when it tells me that starting with the photographs was a big nej nej, I lose heart still further: I’m even doing this wrong.However, the same day, my stepfather, whose brisk campaign of Geordie death cleaning has lasted for decades, emails asking if he can take two flouncy Laura Ashley cushions from my bedroom circa 1985 to Oxfam (last month he offered me “a 9in square of fabric” he found on the cupboard floor). Somehow this lifts me from my gloom. I’m reminded that he held on to, sorted out and passed on all the photographs and exercise books and trinkets I still have from my childhood and I am so grateful to him.Being the custodian of your family’s stuff can be a dusty, dispiriting and often overwhelming responsibility, but it is an act of love of sorts. We weigh it all up, make choices and hope we get it right.“You’re in a sort of limbo,” says Les, now happily settling into her new smaller house, some things given away, some thrown away, plenty kept. “It’s hard. But Em, it’s also an opportunity you don’t get often. It energised us.”It may feel too soon, but perhaps it’s the right time. Perhaps I will feel energised, too, freed from the sometimes stifling, sometimes reassuring weight of all our clutter. And if I make the wrong call here or there, so what? The kids won’t end up in therapy because I didn’t keep their swimming certificates. And what a luxury it is, after all, to be fretting about stuff.So I take up my bin bags again and reclaim Wasp Cupboard. I carefully prune down the boys’ paper mementoes to a box each and give away the Lego mountain. I had planned to leave the lizard on the window ledge, in the hope that a passing small child would fall for his ghastly pudgy face, but I just can’t get him out of my pocket, for some reason. Purple beanbag spider, meanwhile, seems to have taken up residence on my bedside table. Our new house’s clutter collection is coming along nicely.

They covered lots of different moments in ancient times. I remember one was all about Egypt, another concentrated on Greece, another focused on the Incas and the final one was all about America.I devoured them. I was totally captivated by the stories of people who had lived so long ago, and whose lives were in many ways so different from ours and in other ways exactly the same.Those books made me realise that though history is about big world events and politics, it’s also about the ordinary lives of ordinary people. It’s about personal history, in other words.Reading the books sparked a major love of history in me, and now I’m thinking of studying it at university.Maybe in time I’ll follow in my grandfather’s footsteps and teach history, who knows?

The feeling of a world expanding as the boundaries of its grey, slightly frayed arrangements for announcing love, shift. And one result of this change, after a campaign by the London couple Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld, who have been tirelessly pushing for the opportunity to enter into a civil partnership (which until last week applied only to same-sex couples), is that with this expansion, cracks have appeared in the traditions we’ve held dear for centuries. Suddenly, doesn’t marriage look a bit… silly?I speak as someone who’s been with the same person since I was 23, but missed the opportunity to get married when it really made sense, after a year or two when there were still patches of each other’s personalities we were yet to discover, when our commitment to each other was not yet grounded in mortgages, children and cats. When the relationship was small and malleable enough that it required shaping with the cold hand of ceremony. Instead of formalising it with a wedding, we bought a flat. Ahh I loved that flat, we loved that flat, with its chicken smell up from the kebab shop downstairs and the screeching drug deals that serenaded us for 10 short years. We got a new kitchen, instead of a ring. And I speak as someone who’s been to very few weddings, compared with acquaintances on Instagram whose summers appear as a B-roll of white dresses and hashtags of conjoined names and Cotswolds champagne, so perhaps I am ill-equipped to discuss the modern wedding and all its flaws. But I want to, so let’s go.The expansion of possibilities beyond marriage means we can now stand back from the wedding and consider it afresh, as one of many options with which to celebrate love. And from this distance, a wedding looks not unlike a historical re-enactment, or live-action roleplay. He’s the orc, you’re the elf. The costumes are accurate, down to the face-coverings, as is the choreography. Rather than theatrical jousting or the hurling of lightning bolts, there is the walk down the aisle and exchange of rings. Scripts have usually not been altered for generations, these grand dull monologues with words only repeated in churches or fields and only then by a stranger with another job on in Osterley at three.Neither marriage nor civil partnership are ideal. The first carries the weight of centuries of subjugation, of institutionalised inequality between the genders, women the property of their fathers before being handed to husbands the legal position of married women in the 19th century was little short of that of a slave. The second is still smoky with the stench of its history as a consolation prize to gay couples when a homophobic society, under pressure to modernise, was still unable to bring itself to fling open the doors to “actual” marriage. The rights and protections for both are the same the difference is in the language. When you enter a civil partnership, though you’re not dealing with religion, you are accepting state regulation of your relationship whether you stay together or are the one in three who orce. And yet of course, for all my cynical moaning, there’s joy in both, for both are opportunities to make a party out of a relationship, and invite other people in to dance around it and eat cake. However, as last week’s success proves, with Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld’s argument focused on the basis that marriage is outmoded, patriarchal, and built on inequality, there is no need to settle for what we’re given.I would push for an alternative partnership, one rooted not in the graveyard of ancient patriarchy or modern homophobia, but in new ground. How has it taken so long to get here? The fact that ministers spent £65,000 fighting Keidan and Steinfeld’s case, seemingly only in order to reinforce outdated sexist values, adds a darker energy to this move onward, out of the past. And it needn’t rely on the expensive trappings of romance, either, with its pink-lit fairy tales and insistence on forever, its promises so shallow they can be written on a grain of rice. Its weddings that cost more than the entire relationship to date, including the time you booked the wrong train and had to get a taxi all the way to Brighton. Its weightloss and white dresses, its scrabble for the bouquet as if this is the bride’s friends only chance to take control of their own chance at happiness. But neither should it be scrubbed of the ecstasy of love in a ceremony so embarrassed of its own weight that it must be mumbled quickly and explained away with death and taxes. A signature on paper, done, and what? An afternoon off work, an insistence nothing has changed.The widening of language, of possibilities, is exciting and necessary. I look forward now to a hundred new types of commitment ceremonies, partnerships, weddings a hundred new ways to say I love you.After Danny Dyer spoke the most reassuring truth about Brexit, calling David Cameron a twat on TV, twice, an unlikely fan was revealed, with Lena Dunham tweeting, ‘My obsession with Danny Dyer is real and I think about him on average four times a week.’ Two of my worlds collided.

Anyone with a plant in a pot will already be wondering when they are going to stop. By August we will all be begging for mercy. I like them best when they are small, halved or sliced lengthways, cooked on the grill, then dropped into a dressing of olive oil, lemon and basil. That way, they can be tossed with pappardelle and capers or served with paper-thin slices of beef or with grilled prawns. You can tuck them into a soft bun with garlic mayonnaise, and I particularly value them with grated parmesan, more basil and lumps of burrata.You can stop the courgettes in their tracks by cooking the flowers. A light airy batter in scarily hot oil and you have crackling fritters to serve with a wedge of lemon and grains of salt. This time I swapped my usual accompaniments for a bowl of fresh, soft cheese through which I had stirred salted, grated courgette.Summer squashes are the easiest of all home-grown vegetables. They ask little more than sunshine and plenty of water, litres of the stuff. But a couple of plants will provide you with lots of fruits once they get going. I grow them in deep pots on the back steps. As the summer blazes on, you become quite blasé about your bounty of golden flowers and green fruits, and then suddenly they are gone, their dinner plate leaves reduced to a crisp, their energy spent. But for now, there’s more than enough.I am not usually the guy to tell anyone to remove the fat from a piece of beef, but for this, a dish where the meat is eaten raw, it is essential. The strip of creamy beef fat that you have removed is useful: keep it in the fridge, clingfilm wrapped, then use pieces of it in place of olive oil to start frying vegetables, particularly onions. Keep the heat low, so liquid fat runs from the lump, then turn up the heat slightly and cook your vegetables. Onions, fried on a low heat for a good 20 to 30 minutes, are wonderful this way.Serves 2beef 300g, topside or sirloincourgettes 2, medium sizeFor the dressing:lemon juice 75mlolive oil 100mlginger 40gThai basil 10gRemove all fat from the topside. It is well worth taking your time over this. Wrap the meat tightly in clingfilm and place in the freezer for an hour. This is simply to make the beef easier to carve thinly, it will not freeze.Slice the courgettes lengthways very thinly. You can use a vegetable peeler if you prefer, taking long strokes from the length of each courgette. Discard the seedy core.Put the lemon juice in a mixing bowl, add the olive oil and season with salt. Peel the ginger and grate finely into the oil and lemon juice. Tear the basil leaves or shred them with a knife and add to the dressing.Warm a grill or griddle pan. Toss the courgettes briefly into the dressing then place on the griddle, letting them colour lightly, about 2 minutes on each side. As each one becomes ready, remove from the heat and return to the dressing, tossing lightly to coat.Remove the beef from the freezer and slice very thinly with a long, thin-bladed carving knife. Each slice should be cut as thin as you can. (If necessary you can place the meat between two sheets of greaseproof paper or clingfilm and bat it gently with a rolling pin to get it as thin as possible.) Place the slices of beef in a single layer on a plate as you go.Remove the courgettes from the dressing and arrange on two plates together with the slices of beef. Trickle the dressing over, grind a little black pepper and serve.I suggest a soft cheese for this. Something light and creamy, such as a robiola, would work nicely, or perhaps a milky ricotta.For the batter:plain flour 95gcornflour 25gice-cold water 175mlegg white of 1 largeFor the cheese accompaniment:courgettes 3 small onesbutter 30golive oil 3 tbspfresh, white cheese 300gFor frying:groundnut or sunflower oil a deep panMake the batter by combining the plain flour and cornflour in a mixing bowl. Pour in the cold water – it must be ice cold – and mix without bashing out the lumps that form. You don’t want a smooth batter. Set aside in the fridge for an hour.Prepare the accompaniment. Wipe, then coarsely grate the courgettes. Melt the butter in a shallow pan set over a moderate heat then pour in the olive oil. Add the grated courgettes to the hot fat, lower the heat and let it cook for 5 or 6 minutes until it starts to soften and become tender. It shouldn’t colour beyond a bright, pale green.Transfer the courgettes to a bowl then fold in the soft, fresh cheese and season generously with salt and black pepper.Get the oil hot. Beat the egg white to a froth, but not so much that it will stand in peaks, then mix it loosely into the batter. Dip the courgette flowers, one by one, into the batter then lower them carefully into the hot oil. Let them fry for 2 or 3 minutes until pale. Remove them before the batter turns gold and drain on kitchen paper. Serve immediately, while the batter is still crisp, with a bowl of the courgette and cheese at its side.

It looked like a mini castle with a tower red-bricked and handsome, a portal to another time with its stained-glass windows. Back then, I had no idea who lived there. Later, I discovered it belonged to the guitarist and music producer Jimmy Page, erstwhile of Led Zeppelin. I knew I had no hope of ever stepping inside. But life can throw some crazy stuff at you and three decades later, I am invited to visit. I tell Page all of this before he has even fully flexed the door on its hinges, “Well I’m so glad you came then,” he smiles, giving me a hearty handshake.The Tower House actually has two front doors: the half bevelled-glass street door which leads into a mosaic lobby and the actual house door, adorned with brass sculptures showing the Ages of Man. Then, the only way I can describe what happens next is: imagine going to a party and all your best friends are there wearing the most opulent clothes of their lives, and they come and say hello all at once, and for a moment, you are so giddy you can’t compute. This is what entering the Tower House is like.It was designed by the self-styled “art architect” William Burges between 1875 and 1881, in the 13th-century French Gothic style. Burges was well travelled, meticulous about research and detail, uncompromising in his use of materials, obsessed with the Middle Ages and was a skilled metalworker, jeweller and designer before he became an architect. He ran with an arty set: Leighton, Rossetti, Burne-Jones et al was sociable, chronically myopic and even his best friends described him as ugly. He had quite a sense of humour and was absolutely not a cheap architect. Everything he’d ever learned and loved went into Tower House because it was to be his home.Sadly, he was only to live at the house for three years. He died aged 53 in his red bed in the Mermaid Room on the first floor, under painted friezes of waves and swimming fish, and a ceiling of gilt stars studded with convex mirrors. He was next to his painted wardrobe which Page managed to buy back and return to the spot Burges intended it for. (Much of the house’s contents were sold off in 1933.)And here I am now, standing with Page (dressed entirely monochromatically) in the double-height entrance hall, on a mosaic floor depicting the combat between Theseus and the Minotaur, trying to take it all in.The principal rooms in the Tower House all have themes (Time, Love, Literature) and tell a story every room has stained-glass windows, elaborate carvings, frescoes, friezes and if there is a surface that can be embellished or adorned, in the utmost complexity, using the finest of materials, it will be. The chimney pieces are imposing and carved with 3D figures the one in the library depicts the Principles of Speech in Caen stone.The hall’s theme is Time, with giant, almost life-size frescoes depicting the sun and moon, and stained-glass windows symbolising the seasons. The ceiling shows the constellations at the exact time Burges moved in. A stone gallery above links the upstairs bedrooms and overlooks the entrance hall. Page says he first viewed the house, back in 1972, in a dim evening light, and it “captured my heart”.The drawing room and library, where Burges entertained his pre-Raphaelite friends, are off the entrance hall. Page bought the house from the actor Richard Harris (John Betjeman had it before him) and when first viewing it, Harris’s Camelot throne was still in the library.The library walls are lined with richly painted Burges bookcases which now house Page’s books. On the ceiling are the founders of law and philosophy. The windows depict the arts and sciences. The drawing room’s theme is Love, and a medieval Cupid is painted on the ceiling. “Is your house always this tidy?” I ask. “I always try to keep it really tidy,” he says, “but at the moment I think it’s pretty untidy.” (It isn’t.) Page has a cleaner twice a week (“I’m guessing it’s not about spraying wood Pledge around?” I ask. “No,” he replies) and a regime of maintaining the house. It was Grade I-listed in 1949 and its interiors are important and fragile. Page describes how, periodically, things such as the walls in the hall need scaffolding and sugar-soaping by specialists. Everything is meticulously well looked after. I think the National Trust has nothing on Jimmy Page.I am particularly interested to see how the kitchen works in a house like this, but Page won’t let me see because “It’s out of bounds, it’s untidy.” I beg until it’s unseemly he doesn’t budge. (I visit one of the “toilet facilities” later which is all dark blue tiles and William de Morgan fish borders.)The spiral stairs are in the tower. On the first floor, next to Burges’s old room, is the guest room: the Butterfly Room, a blaze of golds and reds, with a heavily decorated ceiling of butterflies and a deep frieze of plants and flowers.The second floor, less elaborate, houses two nurseries (although Burges never had children). The day nursery – with a theme of Jack and the Beanstalk – has the terrifying giant coming out of the chimney. The night nursery is slightly more benign with grotesque monkeys. We descend the stairs to the dining room which is dominated by a giant circular zodiac table, originally commissioned by Harris. Page is excited to point out that the table is a reflection of the design in the enamelled iron ceiling. Page loves the table, his last book was done on it.Page had to sell the boathouse to buy this house. “It’s like guitars – in those days you had to trade in to go to the next one.” He was 28 when he bought the Tower House (he’s now 74) and he’s been looking after it ever since. It seems very young to take on a Grade I-listed house. Did he understand what was involved? “I knew what a Grade I-listed building was and what a privilege it was to live in something like this, yes.”Tower House is sandwiched between two houses undergoing extensive building work (when we go into the garden later, the noise is deafening). Perhaps the most contentious of the two relates to the house belonging to the singer Robbie Williams. Williams wants to put in a basement complex which will come perilously close to Tower House. Page has appealed and the council has currently deferred a decision pending a tightening up of monitoring and supervision of works. At the moment, no one seems able to guarantee the building work next door won’t damage Tower House’s unique and irreplaceable interiors, which is of serious concern to Page.That there is any debate that Tower House should be protected, is perplexing. The only other residential town house Burges built is Park House in Cardiff. It is also listed and has been described by CADW (Wales’s historic environment protector) as “perhaps the most important 19th-century house in Wales.” When a piece of Burges furniture recently came up for sale (there are very few) it was considered so imperative it didn’t go out of the country that the government placed a temporary export ban on it. The Bedford museum bought it. And yet, Tower House is full of Burges. In 2014, three English Heritage engineers, an EH inspector and a conservation officer visited Tower House and described its interiors as of “high heritage value… and highly vulnerable” and that there was no demonstration that the proposed works would “have no adverse impact”.So protective is Page of the interiors and their sensitivity to vibrations, he only ever plays acoustic guitar in the house, doesn’t have parties there and has no television. Just before I go, Page says, a little sotto voce: “I’m sorry I couldn’t show you the kitchen. But…” he continues, leaning forward, “it’s got a La Cornue in it.” I am thinking which artist that is, and then I realise it’s a French range cooker. I see it as a small concession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ce1c9cd47b10161725f58dbb25cd9ace8fa2eea/0_713_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9b68b6d8abace536cc1a8db84738f2","title":"the right way to eat a mango nikesh shukla","story":"In the midst of a particularly good mango season, Nikesh tackles his favourite fruit on a busy Paddington concourseI am waiting for a train home in Paddington station and I’ve got an Alphonso mango burning a hole in my bag. Knowing the best way to eat it isn’t exactly pleasant for my fellow hot and sticky commuters, I find a quiet corner of the station and take it out of my bag.I squeeze the mango, watching the board, waiting for my train platform to be announced. I know I have a good 20 minutes to enjoy this mango, so I continue squeezing the fruit, feeling the flesh pulverise under the skin, turning to a juicy pulp of deliciousness. I squeeze until I can feel the skin is about to break. I squeeze until I can nearly touch the stone in the middle. I squeeze until I know it is ready to eat.We’re in the midst of a particularly good mango season, so I’m going to teach you how to eat one properly. You may have been doing it wrong all this time. This is important. A good mango can lift you. A juicy mango can give you as much pleasure as ice cream. A delicious mango can make you forget, for the time it takes to eat it, that the world is a depressing place right now. We could all use some levity. A break. Ten minutes of joy.I know that some of you will slice and dice, and use the knife to cut off pieces into a bowl. Others might take the skin off before slicing off strips. Many of you may just opt for buying ready-sliced pieces from a supermarket. Don’t.I tear a small strip off the top of the mango with my teeth and then raise it to my mouth, squeezing it and letting the pulp gush into my mouth. It is a moment of utter joy.It takes me back… I’m at home, sitting with my mother and sister, dragging slices of mango across my teeth, tearing the flesh into my mouth. Mum is telling us about how, in Aden, they used to take the mango stone, once it had been sucked dry, and put it on the barbecue overnight. Once cooked, it offered up a whole new experience.I’m with my sisters, eating bowls of rus (mango pulp), laughing and rinsing each other for hours and hours, until we invariably upset Leena for making fun of her feet, a thing years later we’ll all regret.I’m sitting on the beach in Mombasa, eating mango and watching the sea where my dad learned to swim, ebb and flow, in and out of the bay.There are so many memories contained in that mango. For Mum, it was the one fruit that always reminded her of home. For Dad, it’s the only fruit he really eats. For me and my sister, it was the biggest treat when mum would come back from the Sunrup cash and carry with a box of six mangos, all hiding among the torn up strips of newspaper.I squeeze the mango until the skin breaks. I realise someone is staring at me, in disgust. She has just come out of the ticket office and noticed me, hiding in the corner, my hands, mouth and shirt, caked in orange flesh. She practically sprints away from me. My train is called and I run to get it. I still have the stone in my hand.The stone is the prize, my friends. This is the best bit of the mango. It’s the juiciest bit and your job is to suck it dry. My sister and I had to alternate who got the stone each night. Mum was the martyr, saying she would forego it for us to enjoy.I sit in the toilet of the train and suck the mango dry. I think of my daughter. The week before she had asked if we could make lassis. I showed her how to make them. All she was interested in was sucking the stone dry, like a vampire.I sit there, on the toilet of a train heading back to Bristol, thinking about all these things. Maybe mangos are my version of Proust’s madeleines. Most of my happy memories are mango adjacent. It’s a perfect 20 minutes of not thinking about anything else. And it’s exactly what I need.And now you know the best way, the only way, to eat a mango."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/152e18676f66619efe78d6805994a70ac770c81e/74_376_5087_3052/master/5087.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd7250236fa0ca90bd65de26589802a7","title":"rupert murdoch set to receive clearance in bid for full control of sky","story":"UK government expected to allow battle between 21st Century Fox and rival ComcastRupert Murdoch is set to finally be given clearance by the government to take over Sky, freeing the media mogul to lodge a new knockout bid to try to see off rival Comcast.Murdoch must also top up any potential shortfall in funding by Sky News’s new owner, most likely Disney, to keep its budget at £100m for the next 15 years.Hancock has been examining submissions to the final consultation, which closed last Wednesday. If another, new, viable remedy that should have been considered is raised that could result in a short delay to his final decision. However, the government has followed an exhaustive 18-month process involving investigations by Ofcom and the Competition Markets Authority, and observers believe it is unlikely that a new remedy that should be considered would emerge now.Assuming Hancock gives a green light, Murdoch‘s 21st Century Fox is expected to move quickly to lodge a new bid for Sky. The original offer of £10.75p a share, which values Sky at £18.5bn, was made back in December 2016.In April, Sky’s independent committee withdrew its recommendation that shareholders accept Murdoch’s offer after the US cable giant Comcast lodged a £12.50-a-share cash bid valuing Sky at £22bn.“My expectation would be that as soon as approval comes through within a few days there will be a revised bid for Sky by Fox,” one City source said. “The question is how high. If I’m Fox I’d table £15 a share.”Comcast has until the end of this week to formally make its £22bn offer to Sky’s shareholders. If the government and then Murdoch move quickly enough this week, Comcast will be forced to rethink its plans. Last month, Disney, which has offered to buy Sky News from Murdoch to help him secure clearance to buy Sky, upped its offer for Fox to $71.3bn ($38 a share). Earlier in the month, Comcast had trumped Disney’s first offer for Fox ($28 $55.4bn) with a $65bn, or $35 a share, bid.The spiralling price tag on Fox has significant ramifications on the price that will be paid to win the separate battle for Sky.The panel ruled that Disney would have to buy the stake at £10.75 a share – the now 18-month-old bid price tabled by Murdoch.This “chain principle” is designed to make sure minority shareholders are treated fairly in this case to ensure Sky’s minority shareholders receive the same amount as 21st Century Fox.The rule would also apply to Comcast if it beats Disney in agreeing a deal to buy Fox. The battle for Sky should be over in September, with either Fox or Comcast the winner – unless a surprise new bidder emerges. This means it is highly unlikely that whoever is ultimately victorious in the hunt for Fox – Disney or Comcast – will find itself having to make a move for an unsold part of Sky when the deal completes in the US next year.However, the Takeover Panel ruling, which could be announced this week, will nevertheless set a bidding price floor in the battle for Sky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f026b13a99eda2e4279433d407555440e8ffc88/0_0_3957_2373/master/3957.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d46dc7da689fe213c4b1182f42466f8","title":"facebook twitter bias politics news","story":"Social media platforms face internal debates over what line to take on politics and newsOver the past week Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, might have felt a twinge of sympathy for countryman Mark Geiger.

The issue of “bias” is hotly contested, even though, thanks to video footage, every single angle is recorded and analysed. If you read the Spanish version of CNN  you might be forgiven for thinking you had been watching an entirely different match from the English-language CNN. The issue of how you solve bias is very much on the minds of Twitter’s Dorsey and his counterparts at Facebook and other tech companies, as the US political cycle heads to the midterm elections in November.News broke last week that Dorsey was one of a number of technology leaders looking to address Republican concerns that Silicon Valley companies are allowing their liberal bias to affect the way their platforms publish and edit content. By all accounts, including a report in the Washington Post, a series of detente meetings and a dinner took place. This news infuriated those who see Twitter as a main conduit through which the right coordinates attacks on critics and opponents, and as a platform enabling a far right presidency to consistently attack established democratic principles such as those of a free press.Commentators pointed out that the destabilising of platforms such as Twitter or Facebook with incessant complaints, but little evidence of systemic bias, is consistent with the US conservative playbook.Talking to those who are involved in both product and policy at platform companies, it is clear that there are two things happening. One is that most companies are still grappling internally with an ideological business ide about how much the respective companies should involve themselves in politics and news at all the second is that where there is a public commitment to “solving” the problem of toxic discourse (for instance at Twitter), there is intense internal debate about how to deal with bias, or perceived bias.Do companies adopt more overt codes and terms of use which embody company values, which are in themselves political? Do they opt, instead, for a more transparent method of complaint process and arbitration at significant internal cost? One thing, though, is fairly clear: the current state of affairs has to evolve from a push-me-pull-you of the prevailing political will.Tech companies are seasoned veterans when it comes to lobbying political power. But they are, perhaps, less seasoned when it comes to being lobbied themselves. There are very few protocols in place that inoculate the companies against the kind of pressure media companies have withstood, or caved under, for decades.Dorsey’s Washington dinners triggered parallel comparisons with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s ill-fated round table with US conservatives in May 2016, which came after disclosures that human curators suppressed ratings for far-right news sources in one particular ranking formula.Zuckerberg famously, and perhaps rashly, promised that Facebook would be a platform for all voices. Removing human curation and replacing it with robots just ahead of the election cycle did not necessarily cause it to be flooded with Russian propaganda, Macedonian fake news, and other assorted nonsense, but it didn’t help.Robo-moderation cannot recalibrate the political commons. There was another furore in the right-adjacent ranks last week when a passage from the American Declaration of Independence was censored from a news organisation’s Facebook page. A Texan newspaper, the Liberty County Vindicator, had part of a post containing the declaration removed, with a notification from Facebook saying it “violated hate-speech standards”. The passage refers to King George and says: “He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.” It does indeed violate hate-speech standards. It should be classified as fake news but it is simultaneously an important historical document.It is understandable that the policy guidelines and terms of use from technology companies do not tend to have much in the way of an auditing process for political balance. Quantifying bias on a platform such as Twitter is close to impossible, but explanation of contentious decision-making is a much more achievable aim. Whether it is wise or helpful for chief executives to hold closed-door meetings with complaining politicians and lobbyists is doubtful.There is nothing less “Silicon Valley” than the idea of outsourcing complaints to bureaucratic review committees, but when a chief executive’s own political orientation and that of his board is under direct attack it might be a preferable alternative to a sorry tour of Washington restaurants.The United States has a rich if chequered history of thinking about objectivity in relation to its daily newspapers, born partly out of the process during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the press became separated from party affiliations. The famous journalist Walter Lippmann, who wrote many of the grounding principles for modern US journalism, noted that “honest efforts” and the “cynicism of the trade” were not enough to keep journalists from inadvertently exercising their own bias while reporting. Journalists needed “a unity of method, rather than aim the unity of disciplined experiment”.Lippmann’s formula for what was wrong with journalism and how to cure it has itself been put under intense pressure by its impracticality and the advent of social media. The “view from nowhere”, as the media scholar Jay Rosen puts it, stretches credibility in an online environment where we share everything from our lunch options to political preferences online. Like all media systems before them, platforms cannot eliminate accusations of bias, but they might want to think about how to train and hone their referees’ judgment and compensate for the shortcomings of VAR."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward.

Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde.

It is a visual representation of the sampled sonic landscape of forest animals and snarling wild cats that underpins her most recent album, Utopia, and includes inflatable blooms, a wall of greenery and a golden orchid with a flautist hidden inside. The Eden Project, with its sci-fi biomes full of real plants from around the world, is probably the only venue on her tour that dwarfs her ambition to make a theatrical presentation out of the natural world. Björk may be dressed like a DayGlo insect, but Eden Project has a massive wasp. It’s a meeting of minds.That includes her audience. This singular creature has attracted a gathering of peacocks in floral headdresses, some barefoot, faces ablaze with paint and glitter. One man wears a tricorn hat, although perhaps this is inspired by Poldark. On the same day as Pride events, a rainbow coalition stands very still before a stageful of shrubs, as if something unearthly is happening.Björk arrives on stage on a rotating plinth decked out in long grass. She has described the utopia that inspired Utopia as an island full of fantastical, freakish mutations, and so here she wears a DayGlo solid mesh dress that distorts her figure and a mask with antennae. She is flanked by the flute septet Libra, who are dressed in fairy pink. They dance as they play, swaying in unison to the ecstatic reverie of Arisen My Senses, giving the lie to the idea that this abstract music is impossible to dance to.Not that anyone else tries. As Björk sings, Eden’s tribes stand still, spellbound on their feet. She is tender and bashful in Blissing Me, then fragile and devotional in The Gate. Her voice is full of charm and hurt, an elemental howl that appears to affect the fabric of time. On a huge screen behind her, orchids bloom and rot, seabirds preen themselves and Björk herself appears as a mythical animated creature in some timeless fable. The air of a classical recital is further undercut by rude blasts of bass, which detonate under these stuttering torch songs.Conventional pop bangers are few and far between, but this is more of a workout for the heart than the feet. That said, moments of old-fashioned four-to-the-floor – old favourites Isobel and Human Behaviour – come as a relief. The emotional intensity and unorthodox structure of the Utopia songs take a back seat to familiarity, breaking the spell long enough to allow outbreaks of dancing and air-punching. Then the bedazzlement resumes as Libra pick up long, illuminated tubes and whirl them around their heads, creating ghostly tones and spinning discs of light around their singer for a stark and bass-less Features Creatures.Here in dreamy Eden on a midsummer’s night, surrounded by enchanted creatures, Björk is Titania. She plays romantic tragedy as an act of personal defiance, in a voice of total solemnity. With the silly costumes, inflatable plants and cuteness – she says little beyond a polite and adorable “thank you” after every song – she is a bewitching mix of Proms and Panto.

She has joined Bacharach on stage at the first of two London shows, and, like everyone else in the room, is a bit awed. Who could fail to be? Sitting at the grand piano to her right is the co-writer (with the late lyricist Hal David) of one of America’s great songbooks.By this point in the evening, having played a couple of dozen pop cornerstones, he wants it to be known that his songwriting career isn’t over yet. “People say, ‘What are you still doing writing music at your age?’” he says, flicking a dismissive wrist. “It’s what I do.” He and Federer, whose abundance of voice contrasts with Bacharach’s Serge Gainsbourg-like rasp, work through their compositions, both ballads that could do duty in the climactic moment of a West End musical. The same is true of a new song written with R\u0026ampBpop operative Billy Mann, which receives its live debut tonight. While these tunes probably would have ended up on Bacharach and David’s cutting-room floor, they let the 90-year-old flex his melody-writing and arranging muscles. Equally, they provide a pause for the audience to catch its breath. We’ve been dazzled by a nonstop parade of classic songs, of which Bacharach has so many that some are dispensed in medley form – and there’s still not time for all of the hits. The first medley – comprised of Don’t Make Me Over, Walk on By, This Guy’s in Love With You, I Say a Little Prayer, Wishin’ and Hopin’ and Always Something There to Remind Me – serves as a guide not just to Bacharach’s genius for melody but also the complexity of his arrangements. He shares the stage with 36 musicians, including three showy but heartfelt vocalists, and from his piano bench he conducts them. A casual flutter of his hand is his signal for the strings to apply subtle frosting another flutter produces a lustrous sax solo on Anyone Who Had a Heart. When one or another of the singers offers an especially soaring performance, Bacharach acknowledges the feat by hugging them. He remembers struggling to write “a rock’n’roll song” called My Little Red Book for the 1965 film What’s New Pussycat? Manfred Mann’s version was a flop, but to his annoyance, its “strange chords” were changed by the group Love, who proceeded to have a hit. Although the two-hour set is rooted in the past, and Bacharach’s role is mainly that of pianist and raconteur – during a film medley he does sing, in short, weary bursts – he is of the present. He has been watching the World Cup, and shrugs off his blazer to reveal a Three Lions shirt with “Bacharach 9” printed on the back. And while he is not explicitly anti-Trump, his feelings are clear enough when he precedes the mournful 1961 ballad Mexican Divorce with a sardonic: “We wrote this years before anybody thought of building a great big beautiful wall.”The standing ovation that greeted his entrance also sees him off at the end. And with that, England’s unlikely No 9 is off to recover from tonight’s match and prepare for tomorrow’s.

One cabinet minister told the : “He was actually very big about it and by dinner spoke passionately in favour of making it work.” It was reported that the former prime minister David Cameron had been drafted in before the meeting to urge him not to resign.Gove’s decision to back the prime minister was understood to have played a key role in persuading his fellow cabinet Brexiters to agree to the plan, which includes a new customs proposal and a free trade area for goods, although he said the government must also do more to prepare for a “no-deal” Brexit.Appearing on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, he said: “I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t, make the perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the cabinet.“We achieved all of the things that we campaigned for in order to ensure we could leave the EU, but we also do so in a way which respects some of the wishes and some of the concerns of some of my colleagues that voted remain.”However, furious pro-Brexit MPs criticised Brexiter cabinet ministers, including David Davis, Liam Fox and Andrea Leadsom, for failing to take a stronger stand against the government’s proposed offer to the EU, including quitting the cabinet.Andrew Bridgen, a Tory backbencher, told the BBC: “I’m very, very disappointed with the offer that we’ve seen coming out of Chequers. I’m disappointed that so-called Brexiters in the cabinet didn’t pick up the cudgels and fight for a better offer.”The veteran Tory eurosceptic Bill Cash told Sky News: “There are a lot of questions in here, there is a lot of unhappiness, there is a great deal of concern that we are saying that we leave – it’s not ‘to be or not to be’, it’s ‘to leave or not to leave’.An analysis of the Chequers deal circulating within the pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs was damning about the plan, saying it would lead to “a worst-of-all-worlds ‘black hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit”.Gove conceded that the Conservatives’ lack of majority in the Commons meant parliamentary arithmetic was a factor in deciding what could be adopted.The whole cabinet had been summoned to Chequers and spent more than 12 hours thrashing out the proposal for the UK’s future relationship with the EU.It would involve a “facilitated customs arrangement” intended to remove the need for a hard border in Ireland, and the creation of a UK-EU free-trade area, in which the UK would abide by a “common rule book” of EU regulations.Tory MPs are being offered one-to-one briefings in Downing Street over the next few days to win them round before publication on Thursday of the white paper, which will spell out the plan in more detail.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, claimed May’s plans were unworkable and a “fudge” that would be a bureaucratic nightmare to implement, as he called on the prime minister to put them to a vote in the Commons next week.The government still has to negotiate a deal with Brussels, where sources warned the customs compromise looked very similar to the so-called new customs partnership the EU rejected as “magical thinking” 11 months ago.However, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, welcomed the plan and said: “I am ready to adapt our offer should the UK red lines change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf0054f3ee58e25c9ef759e919560daa4c167aa/172_93_2127_1276/master/2127.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=723b7facab32bc5386640a6f44ae9578","title":"england katherine brunt local hero womens odi new zealand headingley","story":"England got the three-match series against New Zealand off to the perfect start with a 142-run win on Saturday, in the first women’s ODI to be staged at Headingley.Half-centuries from Amy Jones and Heather Knight at both ends of the England innings took the home side to 290 for five – their highest ODI total against New Zealand – after they won the toss and chose to bat first. In reply New Zealand slumped to 148 in 33.5 overs, Nat Sciver and Laura Marsh chiming in with three wickets apiece.Sciver, who was the player of the match for her contribution, which included 37 runs, said: “It was a pretty good performance all round. We knew we needed to get through that middle order and make sure we were always on top. We wanted to be clinical and ruthless and we were.”For New Zealand it was the same old story, the loss of Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine in consecutive overs sparking a collapse after the pair had taken the score to 50 without loss after the first 10.Both were lucky to last as long as they did, Bates surviving a big appeal for caught behind when on 13 and Sciver putting down an easy Devine catch at midwicket, both off the bowling of the unlucky Katie George on her ODI debut.George, though, got her name in the scorebook with a wonderful ing catch at mid-off from the bowling of Sciver to send Bates back to the pavilion, only six balls after an equally brilliant snaffle by Sophie Ecclestone in the same position to see off Devine. George also wrapped up England’s clinical bowling display, trapping Holly Huddleston lbw – the last wicket to go after New Zealand lost seven wickets for only 45 runs.England’s innings had got off to a flier as Jones and Tammy Beaumont put on 111 for the first wicket, the pair punishing some short, wayward bowling from the New Zealand pace attack. Of the two, Jones was dominant, reaching her first international half-century on home soil in 56 balls while Beaumont, playing second fiddle at the other end, still had only 25 to her name.Beaumont never looked quite at home at the crease, lucky to survive an lbw shout to the 17-year-old leg-spinner Amelia Kerr which would have been hitting middle stump when on 23, and her stay was ended when she top-edged a Lea Tahuhu bouncer to Katey Martin behind the stumps on 40.Kerr, whose figures of two for 36 from 10 overs were the pick of a bowling attack that otherwise leaked runs, then worked her magic to get rid of Jones, who had looked comfortably on course for a big score, as she was stumped coming down the pitch. Four overs later Sarah Taylor departed, bamboozled by Kerr’s googly for the second time in six days, leaving England on 148 for three. Kerr followed up by bowling the only maiden of the England innings.New Zealand failed to sustain the pressure, allowing Sciver and Katherine Brunt to score at a run-a-ball as both shared half-century stands with the captain Knight – 76 runs coming from the last 10 overs. Ultimately it was Brunt’s innings which received the heartiest cheers from the 2,100-strong crowd as the Barnsley bowler-turned-all rounder slogged her way to an unbeaten 30.“It was about building partnerships and making sure that we were there for a period of time, and still remaining positive with our intent to score,” Sciver said. “The wicket got a bit slow in the middle overs so we needed to manoeuvre the ball and test the field a little bit. It’s something we work on in the nets, so why not play it in the game?”The series continues at Derby on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f215400e45010ac3420b0246460ad60d7327cf85/206_0_3036_1822/master/3036.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0922638724537694a67f33d7609a9a","title":"british grand prix f1 live","story":"Lap 4952: Vettel sets a new fastest lap, of 1.30.9. But, hang on a minute, Hamilton storms in ahead of Bottas, seemingly by invitation, and now we have a real race on. Can Hamilton find a way to trump Vettel in these final few laps?Lap 4852: Bottas dozes off, and Vettel zooms in to regain the lead! Meanwhile, Verstappen is down in 14th, limping around the track. He’s in real trouble will he complete the race? “Head down, Seb,” is the message to Vettel from Ferrari. Lap 4752: One of the front four, one of Bottas, Vettel, Hamilton or Raikkonen will win this race. One man who will not is Max Verstappen after spinning off after clipping his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. Verstappen has lost a place but is moving very gingerly and may have lost more than it seems ...Lap 4652: Bottas and Mercedes are hanging on ...Lap 4452: The crowd are whipped up now, as Raikkonen, gloves-off, pries at Hamilton. The Mercedes, just about, pushes him wide, but you sense the Mercedes-Ferrari duel is only just beginning here. It’s a tag-team effort.Lap 4352: Raikkonen bypasses Verstappen, outwitting the Red Bull after a brilliant move down the outside – that’s been a terrific tussle. It’s probably not over yet. Meanwhile, Vettel and Bottas go wheel-to-wheel but the Finn digs deep to fend off the Ferrari. It’s getting very lively at the front.Lap 4252: Vettel and Bottas are flirting, with the Mercedes eventually pushing the Ferrari aside. Behind them, Hamilton, in third, is lurking, and he must fancy his chances from here on in. Bottas, who leads by 0.501secs, seemingly needs to up the ante at the front.Lap 4152: In just eleven laps time, in and around 15 minutes, we will have a race winner, believe it or not. “He understeered into me, for sure,” Sainz says of that incident. Meanwhile, the safety car is about to dash off again. It’s going to be quite the scrap after the restart. Lap 4052: After the race, the stewards will have another nose at that incident. It was a hard fight between Grosjean and Sainz, and it looks difficult to put any blame solely at either of their doors. Lap 3952: Another two drivers bite the dust, with a huge cloud of dust looming over Sainz and Grosjean. Most importantly, both drivers are up walking, safe and sound, although neither are all over each other on the trudge back to the pits. Good news. But they join Leclerc, Ericsson and Hartley on the sidelines. Meanwhile, the safety car is back at the front of the grid. This plays into Hamilton’s hands, doesn’t it? We will have another restart. Lap 3852: Raikkonen and Verstappen go wheel-to-wheel but the Ferrari nips in front of the Red Bull before exchanging places once more. Round three at Copse sees Raikkonen have another go but he loses out. As for Carlos Sainz, his race is finished, involved in a collision with Romain Grosjean and, once again, we’re in safety car territory. Ah ...Lap 3752: Attendance at Silverstone this weekend? 340,000. Staggering. On the track, with 85km to go, the safety car is gone ... Lap 3652: A little lull as the safety car is still out on track, with Bottas behind. “Aside from once more showing Hamilton’s skill as a driver, his charge up the field does show how ridiculously lopsided Formula One is in terms of car powerperformance,” emails Tim Travers. Hamilton, meanwhile, sounds a little fearful of those Ferrari’s on fresh tyres.Lap 3552: In a funny way, that incident has breathed plenty of life into the upper echelons of this race. Vettel, in second, is now sandwiched in between the two Mercedes. “There’s no way I’m going to be able to compete with new tyres,” Hamilton says. “You’re the fastest guy out there, don’t give up yet,” comes the reply from Mercedes. Lovely. Lap 3452: Vettel pits ... Bottas is staying out. An obvious, but all the same smart move by Ferrari. New soft tyres are going on for the Ferrari, with Raikkonen and Verstappen also pitting. Mercedes, who think they have the better tyres at Silverstone, assume track position. What now?Lap 3352: A terrible crash for Marcus Ericsson, the Sauber, who has gone flying over the gravel at around 190mph before thudding into the tyres. We have a yellow flag, and a safety flag deployed. It looked awful but Ericsson is out of the car and looks to be OK. Let’s hope so. Lap 3252: And Lance Stroll has been lapped by Lewis Hamilton, who trails race leader Vettel by 22.75secs.Lap 3152: Was that a result of Ricciardo overdoing it, or just a wise move by the Red Bull chiefs? “It’s splitting our options at this point in time,” Horner says. “Let’s see how it works out. Sebastian must be nursing that front-left.”Lap 3052: Hamilton’s flying, after setting another fastest lap, shaving a few milliseconds off to record 1.31.546. The fastest ever lap at this track is 1.30.6 ... by Hamilton, of course. The gap to Raikkonen is below seven seconds, and his enemy, for want of a better word, is in his sights. Meanwhile, Ricciardo is back in the pits – again. Soft tyres are going on.Lap 2952: Lovely stuff by Hamilton, who has just dug deep to rack up a new fastest lap of 1.31.682. Fighting chance?Lap 2852: “What’s my position?” asks Hamilton. “Currently P6, all to play for,” comes the reply from his Mercedes engineer. Plenty of time to dent those in front of him yet, though, with just over half of the race run.Lap 2752: Grosjean, the Haas, pits to exit in mid-table mediocrity. Out in front, Bottas is closing on Vettel ...Lap 2652: Hamilton’s in and out in 3.5secs – it’s a little sloppy but he’s back on the track in sixth, behind Raikkonen. Vettel leads from Bottas, Verstappen’s in third and Ricciardo in fourth.Lap 2552: Approaching the halfway stage, Hamilton is told to box after eking out another lap. As Hamilton pits, the gap between Vettel and Bottas is 3.405secs. Lap 2452: “Maybe one more lap,” Hamilton says, conscious he’s just starting to lose a little time. Meanwhile, Raikkonen is breathing down the neck of Daniel Ricciardo. As for Leclerc’s woes in the pits, that will be investigated after the race, stewards say. At the front, it’s Vettel and Ferrari. Lap 2252: On different strategies, Hamilton is told to allow Bottas, his Mercedes team-mate on fresh and slick tyres, to breeze past him. The gap between Vettel and Bottas, in second, is less than 4secs. Lap 2152: And now in comes Bottas. Vettel flies through the chicane and blasts beyond the Mercedes. Hamilton is second, though is yet to pit. How long will they leave it?Lap 2052: Vettel pits, with a blister on his front-left tyre. That means Valtteri Bottas is the new race leader and a fairly sluggish stop means the Ferrari returns to the track only a couple of seconds in front of Hamilton, who is yet to pit. Meanwhile, a bit of oversteer runs Raikkonen into trouble. Not a brilliant couple of minutes for Ferrari, all in all. Lap 1952: Charles Leclerc, the Sauber, is in trouble after flying out of the pits after a 3.2secs stop. And he’s been forced into his first DNF in F1. A rear-tyre problem puts pay to any joy for him this afternoon. He joins Brendon Hartley on the sidelines. Lap 1852: And, with Verstappen and then Daniel Ricciardo pitting, Hamilton is momentarily up into third. It suddenly doesn’t seem so bad after that disastrous start for the Mercedes at Turn 3. Raikkonen, who has just set another fastest lap – 1.32.135 – is making some headway on Verstappen now, who has come out into fifth, with the Ferrari five seconds behind him. Lap 1752: Hamilton trails race leader Vettel by 24.637secs. Meanwhile, third-place Verstappen pits for Red Bull. Lap 1652: Raikkonen eases past Sainz and into ninth, while Hulkenberg, in sixth, is struggling to bat away Leclerc. The Ferrari has just set a new fastest lap of 1.32.670. At the back, Perez and then Stroll, in 18th. Brendon Hartley retired a little earlier – another bad day at the office for Toro Rosso.Lap 1552: Hamilton’s fifth and putting in some pretty decent laps. He has the Red Bulls firmly in his sights ...Lap 1352: In comes Raikkonen for that stationary 10-second penalty. He’s into the pits and says he’s being hampered by front-wing damage. He’s soon in and out, after 2.9secs of nifty work. But he’s out into plenty of traffic, in 10th. Lap 1252: Raikkonen suggests Ferrari need to find a Plan B, and fast. But his team kindly remind him that the 10-second penalty dished out for that clash with Hamilton is hardly ideal. Ricciardo is on his tail. Vettel leads from the front ...Lap 1152: An easy overtake for Hamilton, as he zooms past poor Hulkenberg, and into sixth. It was heavyweight v flyweight kind of stuff, and Hamilton’s pace means he has every chance yet ...Lap 952: Max Verstappen is in third, 15secs ahead of Hamilton, and Daniel Ricciardo’s in fifth. “We managed to stay out of trouble,” says Red Bull’s head honcho, Christian Horner. “There’s still an awful long way go go. Nothing’s over yet.”Lap 852: “How is my front wing?” Raikkonen asks Ferrari down the team radio. “Can you see anything?” He’s fourth but is yet to receive that punishment for that incident at Turn 3. And Hamilton’s up to eighth ... wowee!Lap 752: The stewards have taken a dim view of that incident between Raikkonen and Hamilton, with the Ferrari handed a 10-second penalty for flying into Hamilton’s hips. The blame has been laid firmly at the Finns’ door. Meanwhile, Hamilton soars into 10th. “The rear’s moving around a lot,” he says. “I’m not sure how long it will go.” It doesn’t sound great but he’s making a fist of it. Lap 672: Hamilton trails Vettel, the race leader, by around 23secs. The Ferrari leads Bottas, in second, while Verstappen, the Red Bull is in third. Raikkonen’s fourth.Lap 552: Hamilton zooms past Gasly and Grosjean to march into 12th. It’s not all bad. Mercedes insist there is no damage but it seems psychological for Hamilton, who has it all to do to get into the points.Lap 452: “I’ve lost my floor, I’m sure,” Hamilton says. He sounds down and out, but what he can muster? The stewards, meanwhile, are having a good look at that incident from Turn 3. A replay shows Raikkonen, locking up into the corner, appearing to clip Hamilton. Toto Wolff is not a happy bunny in the pits. Lap 352: There doesn’t appear to be any visual damage, with Raikkonen and Hamilton appearing to get off scot free, although the latter is way down the grid now. He’s clawed back a couple of places, though, and he’s up into 14th. Lap 252: Vettel is way out in front, almost three seconds, after a rasping start. Bottas is next for company, but Ferrari have played the party-pooper here. Only Stroll and Sergio Perez trail Hamilton, in 17th. A dreadful start for Hamilton and Mercedes, after a clash between Hamilton, Raikkonen, Perez and a couple of others. A crazy start. Meanwhile, Brendon Hartley’s retired – his British GP is done and dusted. Hamilton plummets from pole to almost last inside three corners. Vettel made a flying start to jump into top spot, while Bottas assumed second. But disaster for Mercedes. “I think my car’s broken,” Hamilton, in 18th, says. We’ve started with a bang!The routine formation lap is almost done and dusted. Here we go ...Weather update: the temperatures are spiralling. It’s 26.7C in the air, and basically double that out on the track, around 51.2C. It’s sizzling at Silverstone. That hasn’t stopped Kyle Edmund, in action at Wimbledon yesterday, running along, though. We’ve had the national anthem:Up above, the Red Arrows have been making their mark with a very British – and aerobatic – introduction to Silverstone. On the grid, everybody’s going through the motions and gearing up for the off. Kenny Dalglish, Jennifer Saunders and John Bishop are cavorting among the drivers. “I’m sure we’re going to find a solution with Silverstone because we cannot leave this behind,” Ross Brawn, the F1 managing director and technical director says. “It is a very important race and we’ll find some solutions.”Another slice of history at Silverstone today, with only one home hero racing round the circuit for the first time since 1979, when John Watson was the sole Brit, driving for McLaren. This afternoon, it is of course Mr Hamilton. After an intense 24 hours or so, he looks pretty relaxed out there, as lights out approaches.A reminder of the drivers’ championship standings:A lovely moment yesterday Frank Williams in conversation with Bottas:Twenty years on from Michael Schumacher’s controversial win at Silverstone, serving a penalty as he crossed the line, Lewis Hamilton has every chance of making further history by racking up his sixth victory on home turf, surpassing Jim Clark and Alain Prost who both have five wins apiece. Hamilton starts on pole, while Lance Stroll and Sergey Sirotkin, the two Williams drivers, will join Toro Rosso’s Brendon Hartley by beginning in the pit lane. Stroll and Sirotkin spun out during Q1 on Saturday, while Hartley starts in the pits having missed qualifying altogether following a nasty crash. Lewis Hamilton has his own plans of bringing it home. After edging out Sebastian Vettel, the Ferrari one point ahead of him in the drivers’ standings, by the faintest whisker – all 44 thousandths of a second of it – the Mercedes snatched pole on Saturday – his sixth on home soil – with a phenomenal final lap, hurtling his way round a sizzling Silverstone at 190mph, flying into the circuit’s finest, Copse and Becketts, the fastest corners at a track Hamilton himself has labelled as the fastest on the planet. He was essentially breaking the boundaries before tasting the sweet success of doing so it was an adrenaline junkie’s dream. “I had to go over the limit to get that time out of the car, which is dangerous,” Hamilton said, still shaking a little, adding it was his “most pressurised” lap ever.He was whizzing round the circuit while Harry Maguire had nodded England’s football team in front in Russia, and Hamilton has promised to jet out to Moscow if Gareth Southgate’s side reach the World Cup final next Sunday. He even posed in a shirt at his Mercedes debrief. “I guess I wanted to give a boost to England,” he said. “I’ll start the wave and let them continue.” He described it as an “unforgettable day for English sport”, and it might yet get better, as Hamilton searches for a record-breaking sixth win at Silverstone.

Dear old England, always able to conjure up a collapse.18th over: England 181-6 (Willey 0, Jordan 0) A fine comeback from Panda, who started with an over for 22 and ends with four for 38. Southgateian stuff. Another one! Bairstow belts a four past extra cover but then nicks a yorker, perhaps trying to repeat that block for six. England again have two new batsmen at the crease.Stokes, who’s done well considering the rust, gets caught in two minds and chips to long-off, where Kohli takes the simplest of catches. End of a very frisky partnership, 37 off 22 balls.17th over: England 176-4 (Stokes 14, Bairstow 20) Yadav returns, to be greeted by Bairstow with a slog-glance for four and a block for six! It was the wide yorker again, and Bairstow just met it with a prop, and such good timing that it flew over cover. That may have been the liveliest dead bat in history. Stokes then plays a lap for four, to add insult to incredulity.16th over: England 159-4 (Stokes 9, Bairstow 10) India have served up barely a single yorker, and maybe this shows why: Kaul bowls a wide low full toss, which Stokes deflects for four, and then something similar but not as full, which yields two. Trying a Caribbean cover drive, Stokes throws the bat, literally – it ends up somewhere near short fine leg. “Good over,” says Nasser, “just nine from it.” Sign of the times.15th over: England 150-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 7) Chahar’s last over, and he finishes as he began, by conceding a six – Bairstow goes back and flicks him over square leg. That was the third ball of Bairstow’s innings. Chahar finishes with one for 43, which could have been worse.14th over: England 140-4 (Stokes 0, Bairstow 0) I was just thinking, what is Stokes, who is rusty, doing coming in ahead of Bairstow, who is in radiant form? Makes no difference now, as both are out there, with not a run or a ball to their name. Well done Pandya, again. Game very much on. They are throwing it away. Hales pulls imperiously for six, then inexplicably plays the same little dab that got Roy out, and goes the same way.No sooner is he reprieved than Morgan plays the same stroke again. Dhoni calls for it and pouches it safely. Are England throwing this away?Morgan touches the sky with a miscue, giving an easy chance for Chahal, but it’s dropped and poor Chahal gets a nasty bump on the head as he falls over in the process. He goes off for treatment. 13th over: England 132-2 (Hales 24, Morgan 4) Chahal, in his final over, keeps it respectable until Hales flat-bats a wide one past the cover sweeper and thumps a drive back past the bowler. But still, figures of 4-0-30-0, on a day like this, are almost exemplary.12th over: England 120-2 (Hales 13, Morgan 3) Pandya, whose first over was a 22-run horror show, picks himself up, dusts himself off and serves up something very decent. He beats Hales with a straight one that goes clean over middle stump, making Bristol look like Perth, and then hits him on the helmet with a spicy bouncer (no harm done, happily). Only two off the over. Give that man a medal. 11th over: England 118-2 (Hales 12, Morgan 2) Order is restored by Chahal, until the last ball, which goes for four as Hales brings out the slog-sweep. Still, the run-rate has been pegged back to below 11.10th over: England 111-2 (Hales 7, Morgan 1) This is the over with everything. Roy wallops a six, then gets out, whereupon Chahar keeps the new batsmen quiet until he forgets the one-bouncer rule and delivers a no-ball. The resulting free hit is a full toss, the freest of hits for Hales, who clips a six over long-on. Off his three overs, Chahar has one for 33.No sooner has he blasted another six than Roy tries that dab-cut again, to a slower ball, and gets a nick. The firework display is over, and that’s a fine first international scalp for Deepak Chahar. 9th over: England 97-1 (Roy 61, Hales 1) Suddenly it’s a different game. Hales, good as he was on Friday night, would far rather start against the fast bowlers, and Roy settles for a singles, making you wonder if he draws some of his confidence from the way Buttler is playing. Only three off the over, a triumph for Chahal, and an embarrassment for Kohli, who must wish he hadn’t jettisoned Kuldeep.8th over: England 94-1 (Roy 58, Hales 0) Buttler was playing the role Roy took early on, nudging singles to get out of his partner’s way. Paul continues and Roy belts another straight six. A dinky late cut for a single to mix things up, then Buttler gets back into the act with a top-edged pull for four over Dhoni’s head – only to perish as England finally get intoxicated by their own stroke play. Game on?Good Kaul! Amid the carnage, Kohli keeps Kaul on, and he persuades Buttler to miss a straight one. End of a phenomenal partnership.7th over: England 82-0 (Roy 52, Buttler 29) Kohli turns to spin, as you would after being heavily punished for leaning towards seam. Chahal comes on (apologies if the spellcheck calls him Chapel). Roy is dropped again, top-edging to deep square, a difficult chance. He composes himself in the obvious way, with a six over long-on, and that’s his fifty off 23 balls. WG Grace, who played his cricket in these parts, would be quite astonished.6th over: England 73-0 (Roy 45, Buttler 27) Correction: Roy is not being upstaged after all. Pandya comes on, and as if he’s not embarrassed already after that midfield, he goes for four-four-six, all of them to pull shots. And then another six! A massive swing, dropped over the boundary by the man at long-on, as Richie Benaud would have said. That makes 22 off the over, and Buttler can hardly get a look-in. “It has been,” says Nasser Hussain, “England’s second-best powerplay ever.”5th over: England 51-0 (Roy 24, Buttler 26) After bowling the best over of the day, for only six, Chahar is taken off. On comes Siddarth Kaul, in a John McEnroe headband. He has an appeal for LBW, but then Roy bludgeons him for six too. That brings up the fifty off only 27 balls. Odd as it may sound, the Indians may be bowling too fast, letting the ball come onto the bat on a springy surface. 4th over: England 43-0 (Roy 17, Buttler 26) Roy is England’s dasher-in-chief, yet in the first 15 minutes of this game, Buttler reduced him to a spectator. He gets his chance now, thumps a straight drive for four, picks up four more from a bad misfield by Hardik Pandya at mid-off, and rubs it in with the first six, wellied over the miscreant’s head. Don’t read too much into the score – the boundaries are 60m in all directions, so this could be a very high-scoring match.3rd over: England 29-0 (Roy 3, Buttler 26) Chahar continues, with Kohli showing admirable faith. He goes for another four as Buttler wallops him over midwicket, but fights back with an outswinger that beats the bat, which shows character. Gareth Southgate would approve.2nd over: England 23-0 (Roy 2, Buttler 21) Umesh Yadav brings more experience, but he too suffers as Buttler goes deep in the crease to play a lofted straight drive, then rocks back to pull. That makes five fours already: he is in the form of his life. 1st over: England 13-0 (Roy 1, Buttler 12) Kohli, perhaps anxious to show that he is his usual bold self, hands the new ball to the new boy, Deepak Chahar. Jason Roy takes a single off the pads and Jos Buttler, after one sighter, shimmies down the track and off-drives for four. That ball was 87mph! Next, Buttler stays put and chips over mid-on for another four. The slip vanishes, after four deliveries, and the ball needs changing. Kohli packs the off-side ring, so Buttler swipes to leg, only half-hits it, but picks up four more. Welcome to international cricket, Deepak. There are fireworks going off. “As if it’s not hot enough!” says David Lloyd, with true Englishness.England bring back Ben Stokes at the first opportunity, and Joe Root is the man to make way. So still no Moeen, and Stokes, if he bowls at all, will be the fourth seamer. with the bat, he may have to play Root’s role, as the straight man in a starry line-up – Bill Wyman in the Stones, basically.India leave out Kuldeep, of all people – the man who won them the first match. They say it’s because of the dimensions of the ground at Bristol, but it feels unduly defensive to swap a mystery spinner for a medium-pacer, Siddarth Kaul. As he brings out the drinks on this baking hot day, Kuldeep will be able to compare notes on the capriciousness of fate with Dawid Malan. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is injured, so his place goes to Deepak Chahar, who has been taking wickets for fun in India’s series-winning A team.Kohli calls heads, heads it is, and he feels like chasing.Hello everyone and welcome to the third and final Twenty20 game between England and India. On the one hand, it’s a big moment – the decider, the occasion of the season so far, a clash of the white-ball titans. On the other hand, it’s the afternoon after the afternoon before.All England is still in a stupor, merrily suffering from the virus known as WorldCupsemifinalitis, which only strikes once in a generation. Millions have a crush on Gareth Southgate, who seems to be the only British leader trying to combine the values of the young (education, empathy, cuddliness, irony, multiculturalism) with those of their grandparents (honesty, decency, modesty, practicality, keeping tha’s feet on t’ground). Nobody, but nobody, is talking about Paul Farbrace. Perhaps it would help if he started wearing spats.England are the bookies’ favourites today, but only by a whisker, 5-6 to India’s evens. They have home advantage, obviously, and momentum is on their side after a victory that showed a lot of character. But the Indians have more T20 experience, more star power (Kohli, Dhoni), and more ways to bamboozle good batsmen. They gave England a thrashing at Old Trafford, whereas Cardiff was 50-50 until the last five balls. In my book, the narrow favourites are India.Eoin Morgan’s dilemma is whether to bring back Ben Stokes, who is reported to be fit at last. Alex Hales, feeling some hot breath down his neck, has suddenly become a finisher as well as a biffer, so he’s unlikely to be the fall guy. It could be Jake Ball (last in, first out), though that might leave Stokes opening the bowling and exposing his rust. Or it could be Joe Root, the nearest thing to bread and butter in a team that has more jam than the village fete.Meanwhile, Dawid Malan carries the drinks and wonders how on earth he got dropped after four fifties in his first five T20i appearances. For me, this might be an even stronger England XI: Roy, Bairstow, Malan, Hales, Morgan, Buttler, Moeen or Stokes, Willey, Jordan, Plunkett, Rashid. But it won’t be the one that takes the field. India are expected to be unchanged again, although they could go for broke by adding Hardik Pandya’s elder brother Krunal, who bowls slow left-arm, to the two mystery merchants, Kuldeep and Chahal. Jason Roy, for one, will be hoping they don’t.Twenty20 is a game purpose-built to fit in between work and supper, yet this match starts at 2pm on a Sunday – proof that if you chop and change the calendar for long enough, you end up back where you started, with the John Player League. The scores are much the same too, as today’s batters can rattle up as many runs in 20 overs as their forefathers used to in 40. Don’t be surprised if you see women dressed like air hostesses dishing out free cigarettes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e19c0c1a5fee3ced1c662bac24bf770fabcc1a2/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3cc022f59c4f212feb0cc7820f31b84","title":"tour de france 2018 stage two live","story":"Dimension Data’s Jay Thomson, incidentally, has stayed at the front of the peloton alongside Tim Declercq. For those enjoying Sylvain Chavanel’s day in the sun, savour it while you can. He’s now 2:15 ahead and has lost nearly half his lead over the last six miles. The peloton is on the move.Strange to see Jay Thomson seize the initiative on his own only for Mark Cavendish to not even contest the sprint. Either the Manxman is keeping his powder dry for the finish or, adding to his curious comments last night, maybe doesn’t feel on it for today. Or if it’s worth trying to pursue Gaviria and Sagan. Time will tell...That burst of pace has reduced Sylvain Chavanel’s lead to 3:07. With Quickstep re-assuming control of the peloton. Arnaud Démare tried a late sprint but Sagan gave it the full kick and claimed the 17 points ahead of Fernando Gaviria and Alexander Kristoff of UAE Team Emirates.And Bora-Hansgrohe take a full lead-out of four riders with Peter Sagan in towThomson looks a bit isolated, surrounded by Lotto Soudal (Andre Greipel), Quickstep (Fernando Gaviria) and Katusha (Marcelo Kittel) riders. Maybe Cavendish doesn’t fancy this sprint...Dimension Data’s move has seen the peloton quicken ahead of the sprint with 17 green jersey points available for the next best finisher after Chavanel (who has just claimed the 20).Sylvain Chavanel is 1km from a nice, fat 20 points in the green jersey standings.Jay Thomson of Dimension Data has now moved to the front of the peloton which implies a certain Mark Cavendish is going to go for this intermediate sprint, which offers green jersey points (the second is the time bonus, apologies).Love for Direct Energie is strong in the VendéeWell, fair play to Chavanel and excuse me for doubting him but extended his advantage back out to 4:30, with the peloton slowly a little. We’re not far from the intermediate sprint so Sylvain looks to have picked himself up the first time bonus.Some interesting data on who’s putting the legwork in at the front of the peloton.Chavanel seems a popular man in France, with the peloton and among fans across the cycling world. Here’s Matt Cast with his own tribute via email.Seeing as there’s not much going on, it’s a good chance for me to ramble on about Sylvain Chavanel. Although his palmarès may not be considered world-class, he was a shining light for French cycling from about 2007-2012, when only he and Voeckler really consistently turned up for the biggest races. He came so close to winning Paris-Nice several times and just missed out on the Tour des Flandres in 2011. He’s always been an attacking entertaining rider and comes across as an honest, straightforward guy who has always done things the right way despite starting his career during the darkest days of LA and company. It’s great to see him in front getting the adulation he deserves.Before Chavanel is caught, although he’s now pushed back to a 3:12 lead, here’s a nice shot of him. Chavanel’s lead has dropped below 3mins and it’s a matter of when the peloton catch him. Presumably in time for the first intermediate sprint which is around nine miles away. The peloton is slowly but surely catching Sylvain Chavanel. The veteran has lost 40 seconds over the last 15 miles or so. His lead is now 3:18.At the front of the peloton, Yves Lampaert is dishing out the drinks to his Quickstep team-mates Tim Declercq, Bob Jungels, Philippe Gilbert, Niki Terpstra, Julian Alaphilippe, Ariel Maximiliano Richeze and the man in yellow, Fernando Gaviria – that is some lineup.Mark Cavendish’s team-mate and a key part of his lead-out train, Reinardt Janse van Rensburg, is having a frustrating time, having to stop as his chain comes off, twists and takes some time to correct. Chris Froome is nicely positioned among the rest of Team Sky just behind the front of the peloton, keeping a low profile after yesterday’s crash. The four-time winner has a sizeable plaster on his right knee and some nasty grazes across his shin. Thankfully, Molard can continue, grimacing as he battles on. Unclear exactly what happened but he was the only rider to have come off their bike.Ouch. Groupama–FDJ’s Rudy Molard looks in a world of pain as he hits the deck. He’s limping and trying to continue but there looks a problem with his bike as well. Bit of a shame with the Tour losing its only African rider as Trek’s Tsgabu Grmay has pulled out. There wasn’t a crash or any notable equipment issue either. The Ethiopian was in some form having finished 17th in the GC at the Critérium du Dauphiné.We’re approaching the halfway mark. Chavanel is 4:13 ahead and Belgians Declercq and national champion Yves Lampaert are having a bit of a fun and a joke at the front.Not a great deal going on in the peloton. Declercq and Terpstra are still there leading Quickstep, with Lotto Soudal just nudging ahead of Team Sky behind them.Of the 17 previous Tours he’s raced, Chavanel has completed all but two of them. That is some shift. Sylvain Chavanel’s remarkable 18 appearances at the Tour de France is a new record, with the Frenchman overtaking Germany’s Jens Voigt (1998-2014) and Australian warhorse Stuart O’Grady (1997-2013) on 17.Sagan has now got some rather fetching shades on. A hot summer’s day in the French countryside – flies, dust, grit, grass... all sorts being kicked up into the rider’s faces. Strange he didn’t have them on from the start.Peter Sagan has dropped back with some discussions with his team and to take a drink. He didn’t look entirely pleased about everything, gesturing with his hands over his face and there seemed to be an issue with his helmet. Chavanel celebrating his own milestone as well today. It’s his 350th day competing at the Tour – you can do your own calculations as to the distance of that. Some double high-fives with the crowd (wide-10s, maybe). Lovely day in the sun for the Frenchman. Lead is at 4:07.Sylvain Chavanel’s lead continues to hover around the 4min mark with the peloton not showing too much concern just yet. To read more on that Porte news, best head to Cycling News who have broken the story.Transfer klaxon. It seems Richie Porte is a man on the move, switching from BMC to Trek-Segafredo for 2019. BMC have been suffering financial problems having lost some staff earlier this month, including Porte’s primary coach David Bailey. The timing, however, is somewhat surprising. Porte has been with BMC since 2016 having transferred from Team Sky to try and win a Grand Tour, with his best performance being a fifth-placed at Le Tour that same year.Nice little nugget courtesy of the knowledgeable people at the Tour de France.Direct Energie’s manager Jean-René Bernaudeau turns 62 today, and Chavanel is leading the stage through his native region. Distance-wise, Sylvain Chavanel is around 9 miles ahead of a Quickstep-fronted peloton and all the major GC contenders safely positioned.Tim Declercq is back out in front of the peloton, having a bite to eat. This is a shot from earlier with the peloton framed by the Sacred Heart of Vendée – the flag of the region, which dates back to the 1793 War in the Vendée during the French Revolution. Footage of Sylvain Chavanel descending. Meanwhile, Porte is back in the peloton after his wheel change.Sylvain Chavanel continues to power on, 3:26 out on his own. The eternally-unlucky Richie Porte has also stopped, seemingly for a change of equipment and he digs in to rejoin the peloton.Extra word on man of steel Lawson Craddock who started the day seven minutes back after his awful crash, but will donate $100 to his local velodrome in Houston for every stage he finishes this year. The Alkek Velodrome was flooded by Hurricane Harvey and Craddock also auctioned a pair of his shoes earlier this month. Dion Smith claimed a point on the climb at Pouzauges and is level with Kevin Ledanois in the King of the Mountains standings, so the best rider in the GC will take the polka dot jersey tonight. First sighting of Adam Yates with the 25-year-old at the rear of the peloton alongside the rest of his Mitchelton-Scott team.Peter Kennaugh, who left Team Sky for Bora–Hansgrohe at the end of last season, has reluctantly just revealed on ITV he’s gone vegan and given up coffee and alcohol this year. Dion Smith has now been reeled in by the peloton so it’s firmly a one-man breakaway with the 39-year-old Chavanel showing the youngsters how it’s done.It’s Sylvain Chavanel who is out on his own. Impressive for the third-oldest man in the field to be leading by 2:40 as he shows off a bit of top-bar descending... not bad for Direct Energie’s sponsors in their home region, either.Gogl looks to be struggling a bit and has dropped back into the peloton.

Yet this advanced technology actually dates back to Victorian times when battery-powered horseless carriages shimmied around the streets of London and Paris. The first land speed record was set in 1898 by Count de Chasseloup-Laubat in an electrically driven Jeantaud – he briefly touched 39mph.If you have never driven an all-electric car before, it can take a while to get used to. The utter silence is unnerving. I am never sure if I have turned the car on or not. The moment you touch the throttle and it creeps forward always gives me a small jolt of panic. It feels as if you are rolling downhill with the handbrake off. Press the pedal harder and the instant torque and smooth acceleration is addictive. Electric motors don’t have gears, so the swoosh from 0-60 is completely seamless.Nissan has worked hard to make the Leaf so much more than simply a car with an electric motor. It is brimming with aids to make your ride safer, more connected and more effortless. The car has ProPilot, a suite of systems that deals with everything from traffic jams to keeping your distance on the motorway. It will steer for you, park for you and even bring you to an emergency stop. It’s autonomous driving as far as the law currently allows. Or you can switch off all the gadgetry and have fun driving it like an electric dodgem. The heavy floor-mounted battery creates a low centre of gravity so it corners with virtually no body roll.One thing which will throw you is its e-Pedal. Flick this button and you can drive the car with one pedal. You press the throttle as usual but remove your foot and the car applies automatic regenerative braking. The quicker you lift your foot the heavier the braking. The Leaf swept up dozens of awards the moment it was launched – all well deserved. But the true measure of its standing in the automotive world is that it in no way feels like a gimmicky electric car. It feels like a real car for the real world.

To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4f1dc1d4e63cc78e4ee6b5ea817859b12c22f0/513_134_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f77fecaccbe095be17594bb040eb7660","title":"fray bentos uruguay not just a meat pie","story":"The sleepy town was once home to the food brand that began in 1863 and the industrial landscape is now a world heritage siteIf you are lucky enough to reach the tiny Uruguayan town of Carmelo on a summer evening, you can cycle through tranquil vineyards, past lavender bushes and a yellow chapel glowing in the fading sunset to the Italian social club for dinner. Founded in the 1930s, very little has changed since then. Lo Korrea still serves the cheap, hearty food Italian farmers devoured after a day harvesting grapes on Saturday nights and sometimes Sunday lunch. The food is unrepentantly old-fashioned, heavy in cream and sugar, and the prices are, too – just under £12 for wine and three courses. On the evening we went there was a 60th wedding anniversary, with music seeping through a wall into the annex where we ate, and the odd child in a suit or frilly dress, eyes wide with sugar and excitement, wandering through the door.We ended up in Carmelo on our way to somewhere else even more improbable. Fray Bentos. Many people who recognise the name are astonished to find out that it is really a town, as opposed to the British brand of canned meat products, originally corned beef and then ready-made pies. It’s actually both. The sleepy, charming riverside town in Uruguay, was also home to the Fray Bentos brand which began in 1863 in a sprawling factory. In its heyday this cathedral of the industrial age, built along the town’s lush riverbank, fed half the world, churning out corned and frozen beef to fuel wars and the rise of empires. It played such a role in the transformation of how we eat worldwide, bringing meals into the industrial era, that three years ago Unesco declared the abandoned and ruined complex a world heritage site.When my Uruguayan godmother told me Fray Bentos was a place, not just a pie brand, we decided we had to visit this forgotten icon. The production lines have long since closed, the docks are decaying and it has fallen back into sleepy silence, disturbed only by tourists drawn to its strange and striking heritage. It is an unlikely holiday spot but a rewarding one, the quirky colonial charm of the town a perfect counterpoint to the stark remains of the factory, and if you tire of history there are beaches, ranches and one of Uruguay’s most unusual and relaxing wine areas just a short drive away.According to local legend, Fray Bentos was named after a shepherd who pointed travellers on their way. His legacy has been picked up by the locals who guide visitors through the sprawling factory complex, paved with iron to withstand the weight of thousands of cattle. There is a strange beauty in parts, particularly the turbine hall. A checkerboard marble floor (the stone was chosen in the 1920s for insulation), vast wheels arching towards the vaulted ceiling, frozen by time and rust, and sunbeams picking out the dust motes in the silent air give it something of the feel of an abandoned temple.There is even an inner sanctum, a control room of practical luxury, panels adorned with intricate metal-work and more marble, where engineers tended to the mysteries that kept the wheels turning. The plant was founded by a German inventor whose “meat extract” a liquid precursor to Oxo, needed vast quantities of beef, so he came to Uruguay where cows were plentiful and cheap. In the 1920s a British company bought the firm, giving it its local nickname, El Anglo. The town’s name became a byword for corned beef. Meat from Fray Bentos fed troops in both world wars, and British troops even nicknamed one tank Fray Bentos, a dark joke about a crew that were little more than minced meat in a can.A small museum tells the plant’s history and features curiosities such as a two-headed calf and Uruguay’s first lightbulb. When the tour finishes you can mull over the cycles of wealth and decline that played out here, the dawn of globalisation before the word was even coined, over lunch at La Chimenea, on a riverside terrace built over the plant’s former water pumping station, with a view clear across to Argentina. Inside, wood burns to charcoal in a hearth several metres wide, to grill the parrillada (barbecue) of perfectly seared meats (and a few vegetables if you insist) – a Uruguayan national passion. The owners are so friendly that when we found out they didn’t take cards, and we didn’t have enough cash, they told us just to put an envelope under the door later. It only serves lunch though, so save dinner for the town, a separate world from the factory complex with its villas, Anglo-Germanic sense of order, and probably the world’s only town-square monument to corned beef.Wealth seeped over into Fray Bentos, so the streets are adorned with strange and charming curiosities, such as the bandstand in the central square which is a copy of the one in Crystal Palace, a lavishly decorated theatre and rows of grand colonial homes, with high barred windows hiding inner courtyards from curious passersby. One has been turned into a hotel, the Posada del Frayle Bentos, whose sense of history has more or less survived a slightly brutal modernisation, with the addition of a plunge pool which offers a welcome chance to cool off on summer days. Locals stroll around to relax, or drive excruciatingly slowly up and down the riverfront. “It’s a small town – if we drove fast we’d be at the other end too quickly,” one explained.You can get a simple dinner and a drink with a view at Cervecería Hoffman. Save dessert for ice-creams at Heladeria Deleite, where they have five or six variations on dulce de leche – the creamy caramel that is a national obsession. If you fancy some exercise after that, there is a nine-hole golf course designed for El Anglo executives by the famous course architect Alister MacKenzie and recently refurbished for the top brass of a new factory complex upriver. Its open to visitors, although don’t expect golf carts or Trumpian flourishes of luxury.We had come to Fray Bentos through Carmelo, the most northern terminal for ferries from Buenos Aires, and somewhere else with a delicious sense of forgotten time and place. The streets were as empty as a town in a Gabriel García Márquez novel, during siesta, or after a cataclysm. The old wine district of Colonia Estrella is just 15 minutes by bike from Carmelo, across pancake-flat fields and empty roads, where we stayed at a lodge and boutique winery, Campo Tinto. The star grape in the region is an unusual variety called tannat, which grows well in Uruguayan soil and has become the country’s calling card, like Malbec for neighbouring Argentina. Campo Tinto also has a viognier and a special Uruguayan blend – medio y medio – a kind of sparkling semi-sweet rosé, a tribute to a cocktail popular with port workers in Montevideo and perfect for summer afternoons.• Most of the hotels in Carmelo offer bicycles with the room, or rent them out for a nominal fee, and it is a wonderful place to cycle, almost pancake flat, with wide, largely empty roads.• Cars can be rented from Marino Sport, who are very flexible on pick up and drop-off locations, and will come to you for a small fee.• Or there are buses from Carmelo to Fray Bentos twice daily. Book here.• Most of Fray Bentos is walkable, or the hotel can help you find taxis. • Entrevinas is a romantic cabin for two, set among the Bodega Cordana vineyards in the mornings breakfast will be left in a basket on the porch, otherwise you will be undisturbed.• Campo Tinto has an excellent restaurant and small swimming pool to enjoy, along with the wines.Fly to Buenos Aires with British Airways or Iberia, then get a ferry to Carmelo with Cacciola Viajes.

Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach. Breakfast is excellent and the hotel makes its own fresh lemonade – perfect for kicking off the morning. The Markopouloses, who own the Ulysses, are a mine of information and treat their guests as one of the family.The stunning, rugged hamlet of Gerolimenas, at the head of a fjord-like inlet, was once a busy trading post now it’s a nostalgic post-boom village, and comprises a mere handful of stone houses, a couple of tavernas and a beach.Eat and drinkThe fish – guaranteed fresh – is excellent here. Head for the harbour and you won’t go wrong.StayIf you want remote coupled with contemporary boutique-style comfort, a stay at the Kyrimai hotel should suit. Converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea to three sides, the hotel has a standout restaurant, and you can plunge directly from its jetty into the clearest of seas. Recommended for couples more than families, this is definitely one for romantic getaways.Find last-minute summer holiday deals at sunviloffers.

Pyongyang, however, made clear it had no intention of carrying out the comprehensive unilateral disarmament Donald Trump has claimed was the outcome of his 12 June summit in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.In rebuffing the US approach to talks, the regime laid out its most detailed negotiating position to date, suggesting confidence-building measures each side could take, including a proposal to freeze production of intercontinental ballistic missiles and a call for a formal declaration ending the Korean war of 65 years ago.A long detailed statement from the North Korean foreign ministry on Saturday gave an assessment of the past two days of talks between US and North Korean delegations in Pyongyang, describing them as “regrettable”. The statement flatly contradicted the upbeat assessment from Pompeo, who headed the US delegation. On leaving Pyongyang for Tokyo, Pompeo had said the two delegations had made progress on “almost all the central issues” and that on some issues there was “a great deal of progress”. Speaking later in Tokyo alongside Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers, Pompeo insisted the Pyongyang regime had accepted it would have to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme entirely.“From weapons systems, to fissile material, to production facilities, it’s a broad definition of denuclearisation and they have not challenged that,” he said. Asked how he could think the North Koreans had been negotiating in good faith, Pompeo replied “Because they were.”The North Korean foreign ministry statement, by contrast, adopted a wounded tone, saying hopes of progress raised by the Singapore summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, had been dashed by the one-sided approach taken by Pompeo’s delegation.In particular, the statement to took the Americans to task for insisting on complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament (CVID).“The US side came up only with its unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearisation just calling for CVID, declaration and verification, all of which run counter to the spirit of the Singapore summit meeting and talks,” the statement said.It also complained that Pompeo’s team never mentioned “a peace regime on the Korean peninsula”, which for Pyongyang involves scaling back the US military commitment to South Korea, and the formal declaration of peace.“It seems that the US misunderstood our goodwill and patience. The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that the DPRK would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, the demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset.”Pointedly, the foreign ministry said “We still cherish our good faith in President Trump”, suggesting that the “headwinds” to progress were being created by others.If the talks failed, it warned “this will finally make each side seek for another choice and there is no guarantee that this will not result into yet another tragedy”.Pompeo met the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, on Sunday, to brief him on the Pyongyang talks. Speaking at the start of the meeting at his Tokyo residence, Abe paid tribute to the “strong leadership” Pompeo had demonstrated in Pyongyang.“This really shows the unwavering bond of the Japan-US alliance,” the prime minister said. Pompeo later restated the US position that sanctions would remain in place until “final” North Korean denuclearisation had been carried out.The Pyongyang talks, however, appeared to have exposed a wide gap between the way the Trump administration and Pyongyang interpreted the outcome of the Singapore summit. In a joint statement with Trump, Kim committed his regime to move towards “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”.Trump took it to mean total and unilateral nuclear disarmament. He returned to the US claiming North Korea was “no longer a nuclear threat”. Last week in Montana, he told a crowd: “But we signed a wonderful paper saying they’re going to denuclearise their whole thing. It’s going to all happen.”However, since 1992, the regime has used the phrase, “complete denuclearisation” to mean a drawn out, phased process of mutual demilitarisation of the peninsula.In Singapore, Trump and Kim also agreed verbally on mutual confidence-building measures, in which Trump would suspend military exercises with South Korea, while Kim would dismantle a missile engine testing site and repatriate the remains of some US soldiers killed in the Korean war.Trump immediately ordered the suspension of what he called US-South Korea “war games”, dismissing them as too expensive. However, Pyongyang has yet to deliver on its side of the bargain – destroying the test site and sending back the soldiers’ remains.Saturday’s foreign ministry statement lays out an expanded North Korean version of what mutual confidence-building measures would look like.It said Pyongyang would dismantle the “high thrust engine” testing site as a concrete measure towards “the suspension of ICBM production as part of denuclearisation steps” while making a start of “working level talks” on repatriation of remains.In return the US would make “public a declaration on the end of war” on the 65th anniversary of the Korean war armistice, which falls on 27 July.It remains unclear how Trump will respond to the withering North Korean rhetoric. So far he has ignored suggestions that he achieved little of substance in Singapore.Colin Kahl, former national security advisor to vice-president Joe Biden, assessed the latest developments in a tweet.“The good news: If diplomacy continues to stall, Trump will probably not go back on the war path because that would require him to admit he got suckered by Kim,” Kahl said. “The bad news: He got suckered by Kim.”Soon afterwards, Susan Rice, who was national security advisor to Barack Obama, replied on Twitter.“No, Colin, once he realises he got suckered, he will go on the war path to try to prove his manhood. He will manufacture some excuse other than his own gullibility,” Rice said. “This will get dicey again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d23b28e9bc84d16cdfb99aeb5edca13e42865513/0_163_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d33347d9e83d84e6935dae88e838831","title":"abiy ahmed upending ethiopian politics","story":"New PM has electrified country with his informal style, charisma and energyAbiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, has accelerated a radical reform programme that is overturning politics in the vast, strategically significant African country.Since coming to power as prime minister in April, Abiy has electrified Ethiopia with his informal style, charisma and energy, earning comparisons to Nelson Mandela, Justin Trudeau, Barack Obama and Mikhail Gorbachev.The 42-year-old – who took power following the surprise resignation of his predecessor, Haile Mmariam Dessalegn – has so far reshuffled his cabinet, fired a series of controversial and hitherto untouchable civil servants, reached out to hostile neighbours and rivals, lifted bans on websites and other media, freed thousands of political prisoners, ordered the partial privatisation of massive state-owned companies and ended a state of emergency imposed to quell widespread unrest.In recent days, Abiy fired the head of Ethiopia’s prison service after repeated allegations of widespread torture, and removed three opposition groups from its lists of “terrorist” organisations.On Sunday, the former soldier met president Isaiah Afwerki of Eritrea in a bid to end one of Africa’s longest running conflicts. The two men hugged and laughed in scenes unthinkable just months ago.“You don’t want to exaggerate but for Ethiopia, a country where everything has been done in a very prescriptive, slow and managed way, these changes are unprecedented,” said Ahmed Soliman, an expert in East African politics at London’s Chatham House. “His main task is to satisfy all expectations of all groups in a huge and erse country. That’s impossible but he’s trying to do so with some gusto.”Despite an International Monetary Fund forecast predicting that Ethiopia would be the fastest-growing economy in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, even the officially sanctioned press has admitted the country’s serious difficulties.The Addis Ababa-based Reporter described “the spectre of catastrophe hanging over Ethiopia” and called on the new prime minister to pull the nation “back from the brink”.Ethiopia is facing a critical shortage of foreign currency, only temporarily solved by an infusion of cash from the United Arab Emirates. There is growing inequality, a shortage of jobs for a huge number of graduates, significant environmental damage, ethnic tensions and a hunger for change.Abiy has apologised for previous abuses and promised an end to the harassment.“I have always lived in fear but I feel less threatened when I write than I did before,” Hailu said. “It’s not only his word … the moment he spoke those words the security personnel down to the local levels have changed.”But not all back Abiy’s efforts. Last month, a grenade was thrown at a rally organised to showcase popular support for the reforms in Addis Ababa’s vast Meskel Square, where many among the tens of thousands supporters wore clothes displaying the new prime minister’s image and carried signs saying “one love, one Ethiopia”. Two people died and more than 150 were injured in the blast and the stampede that followed.“Love always wins. Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded,” Abiy said in an address shortly after the attack.Officials said there had been other efforts to disrupt the rally, including a power outage and a partial shutdown of the phone network. At least 30 civilians and nine police officers were arrested.One possible culprit could be a hardline element within Ethiopia’s powerful security services – Abiy has replaced military heads with civilians and admitted past human rights abuses. Another could be a faction opposed to the effort to find peace with Eritrea.Strafor, a US-based consultancy, said the perpetrators of the “amateurish” attack were more likely to be from one of Ethiopia’s restive regions.The Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the rebel coalition that ousted the Derg military regime in 1991, is split by factional battles between four ethnically based parties as well as fierce competition between institutions and iniduals.Abiy was seen as a relative political outsider before being picked for the top job by the EPRDF council. He is the first leader from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic community, the Oromo, who have complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation.Born in western Ethiopia, Abiy joined the resistance against the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as a teenager before enlisting in the armed forces, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He has a doctorate in peace and security studies. After a stint running Ethiopia’s cyberintelligence service, he entered politics eight years ago and rose rapidly up the ranks of the Oromo faction of the EPRDF, which has historically been at odds with the Tigrayans.Analysts say Abiy’s mixed Christian and Muslim background, and fluency in three of the country’s main languages allow the new leader to bridge communal and sectarian ides. He has also reached out to women, making an unprecedented mention of his wife and mother in his acceptance speech.One personal acquaintance described the new prime minister as “always looking ahead for the future”.“He is also a good listener but with a bit of headstrong attitude towards people who don’t deliver,” said Yosef Tiruneh, a communications specialist who worked under Abiy at the science and technology ministry.Tiruneh, said shelves of books on religion, philosophy and science filled Abiy’s office. “He is physically active and very well organised ... He did not have a secretary because he wanted his office to be accessible. His office door was literally never closed.”Andargachew Tsege, a British citizen unexpectedly pardoned in May after four years on death row on alleged terrorism charges, said Abiy was “very intelligent and a quick learner” who was committed to democratisation.“Abiy invited me to meet him two days after my release. We spoke for 90 minutes and a lot of issues were discussed. It was a meeting of minds. This guy means business,” Tsege, who was abducted by Ethiopian security services while in transit in Yemen four years ago, said.But some point out that the autocratic nature of decision-making in Ethiopia has yet to change, even if Abiy is using his new powers to reform.“The country is still being led by one person and his cabinet,” said Tigist Mengistu, an executive in Addis Ababa. “Sadly we have been there for 27 years and we want that to change. It is bad for a country as erse as Ethiopia,” she said.Additional reporting by Hadra Ahmed in Addis Ababa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ed1882fdb72bd77a08ea569b03ac84626b91b3e/0_52_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c4f596bc9e5f46251f27e24a701ab8","title":"german author thilo sarrazin sues random house for not releasing book on islam","story":"Munich court to hear dispute between ex-central banker Thilo Sarrazin and publisherA German author is taking Random House to court over the publisher’s decision not to release his latest book on Islam.The dispute between the publishing group and Thilo Sarrazin, a former central banker and Berlin state finance minister, will be heard before a court in Munich on Monday.According to Bild newspaper, Sarrazin had in November 2016 signed a deal with Random House for a work of non-fiction with the working title Hostile Takeover: How Islam Hampers Progress and Threatens Society.After accepting the delivery of Sarrazin’s manuscript in February this year, however, the Munich-based publishing group in May reportedly decided against publishing the book.Sarrazin, a member of the centre-left Social Democratic party, has in the past courted controversy with his 2010 book Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany is Digging its Own Grave), in which he accused immigrants of “dumbing down” German society.Sarrazin’s bestseller has been endorsed by rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland, who invited the 73-year-old to speak in front of the Bundestag this year.A spokesperson for Random House said on Friday the publishing group neither planned to “stop” Sarrazin’s new book “nor hinder its publication”, but that the author was free “to publish his book with another publishing house”.Hostile Takeover is scheduled to be published in late August by Munich-based FinanzBuch Verlag, a publisher that usually specialises in non-fiction books dealing with business and trading subjects.Random House, originally a US publishing house, was bought by Germany’s Bertelsmann group in 1998 and in 2013 merged with Penguin to form Penguin Random House, the world’s largest book publisher.Munich-based Verlagsgruppe Random House is not part of the Penguin Random House group, however, and remains owned by Bertelsmann only."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cda89e0dd16e1c2c5ba04f6d65cbca75c74b540/0_74_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bc064dd5e88d92b81b0bcd2e061d7b8","title":"indian book cafe men serving life sentences shimla","story":"The Book Cafe in Shimla helps prisoners convicted of violent crimes stay part of societyBy day, from the cafe in Shimla where he works, Jai Chand enjoys one of the city’s best views of the Indian Himalayas. In the evenings, his view is one of the worst.For 11 hours a day, the staff at the Book Cafe serve coffee and food to a stream of customers. Then they lock up and walk the 15 minutes back to prison.Chand, 48, and his colleagues are all convicted criminals serving life sentences. They have been running the cafe since April 2017, as part of an initiative to help prisoners maintain a connection to society and earn money to support their families.No prison officers are in sight as the men count money, prepare food and contend with the afternoon rush of children in school uniforms. Each staff member qualified for the programme by demonstrating years of good behaviour behind bars.“For the last two years there has not been even a single complaint from anybody,” says Sanjay Chauhan, the former mayor of Shimla, who established the scheme during his term. The programme is considered a success, but one night last week the cafe was burgled. Of course, Chand and the staff had alibis.The cafe is one of a range of operations being run by prisoners in Himachal Pradesh state, including mobile food vans, online supermarkets and theatrical shows performed to the public. “If somebody has done a crime, it doesn’t mean they are a criminal for ever,” Chauhan says. “We have to give them an opportunity to be decent men also, and earn for their families.”Once the crowd of customers clears, Chand explains how he ended up in prison. “Section 302 of the Indian penal code,” he says. Murder.Seventeen years ago, Chand claims he arrived home to find his wife attempting suicide. He tried to save her, he says. But the police believed otherwise, accusing him of drowning and then strangling her, and a court concurred. Chand was sentenced to life in prison. Only a laminated government notice announces the cafe as any different to the others on the street. Many customers are not aware that the men behind the counter are serving time for violent crimes the ones who do know are unconcerned.“The staff here are very humble,” says Puneet Sharma, a regular customer. “People are happy, they are supporting this.”Mohit Chauhan is surprised to learn who has been serving him coffee for the past few months, but shrugs. “I’m happy people are getting the opportunity to work,” he says.For Chand, it is more than just a job. “When I was in prison, we weren’t a part of society – we were isolated,” he says. “When I’m here I feel like part of society. I matter, I’m human.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c9e07276df2888d7fe1c23c9ead3858bda92c7/0_47_3986_2391/master/3986.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c12be56f30980cea682c4db91b75a1f","title":"ines arrimadas catalan pro unity party leader accuses spanish pm being mortgaged separatists","story":"Leader of pro-unity party accuses Spanish PM of ‘being mortgaged’ to separatistsSpain’s new Socialist prime minister is due to meet the hardline nationalist president of Catalonia on Monday amid warnings that Madrid must defend national unity and avoid making any concessions to the separatists who have triggered the country’s most serious political crisis since its return to democracy 40 years ago.Pedro Sánchez, who took office at the beginning of June after ousting Mariano Rajoy through a no-confidence vote, has shown a more conciliatory approach to the Catalan controversy than his conservative predecessor and has sought to reduce tensions.Earlier this month, six of the nine Catalan leaders facing charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds were moved from prisons near Madrid to jails in Catalonia in what was widely seen as a gesture of good faith.However, while welcoming the talks, the Catalan president, Quim Torra, has made it clear that he will seek a referendum on self-determination. The call will be given short shrift by Spain’s socialist government, which is adamant that the right to self-determination does not exist in the country’s constitution.Sánchez has instead suggested that parts of the constitution could be reviewed once temperatures have cooled and the powers of Spain’s central and regional governments re-examined.Inés Arrimadas, the leader of the Catalan branch of the centre-right Ciudadanos party, which won the largest share of the vote in last December’s regional elections, has accused Torra’s government of neglecting and alienating the majority of Catalans who do not support independence.“What really hurts me most is them portraying all Catalans as pro-independence,” she told the .“That’s not true. Right now in Catalonia, there’s a big and very important minority of people who want independence and a majority of Catalans who don’t. But we’re all Catalans and we all deserve respect and a government that respects and defends all of us. But they don’t see that because their thinking is exclusive.”Arrimadas accused Sánchez of “being mortgaged” to the separatist parties after relying on their support to topple Rajoy, whose People’s party has been embroiled in a series of corruption scandals.“The PSOE got into government without a plan for government or a parliamentary majority and they’re improvising,” she said. “The only decisions they’ve taken so far are the ones that benefit the nationalists.”She said existing electoral law needed to be changed as it meant that Catalan separatist parties were over-represented in parliament.Arrimadas said Sánchez needed to understand that the country required reform, adding: “There can’t be any hang-ups when it comes to defending values such as the equality of the union and the solidarity of Spaniards just as we defend those values in Europe.”Ciudadanos, which was riding high in the polls before the motion of no-confidence, refused to back Sánchez’s efforts to topple Rajoy. However, Arrimadas rejected suggestions that the party had misjudged the public mood and found itself on the wrong side of history.“In Spain, no-confidence votes are constructive: it’s not just about showing that you’re rejecting something, it’s also about voting in favour of the alternative,” she said.“We didn’t want Rajoy’s People’s party … or the alternative that was voted in. We wanted people to have the chance to choose a new, strong government at the ballot box – and one that wouldn’t need the nationalists to govern.”Arrimadas said last year’s illegal independence referendum and the subsequent unilateral declaration of independence had left Catalan society deeply fractured.Torra’s government, she said, would do better to stop obsessing over independence and focus instead on issues that affect all Catalans, such as healthcare, employment, infrastructure and the fight against corruption.Arrimadas also called on the new Catalan president to respect the views of pro-unity Catalans.“He’s a person who’s written hundreds of xenophobic and supremacist articles. If this gentleman talked about other groups – other races, other religions – the way the talks about Catalans who don’t support independence, he wouldn’t be able to carry on in politics,” she said.“But because it’s only us he’s talking about, it seems there’s no problem. We’re used to being shamed. But we can’t have a government that humiliates millions of Catalans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/809417b64e8b2fcb902cbcace17efdca643d59c2/7_510_3913_2349/master/3913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71f38f1c665d5ccc86af82144824a2ad","title":"pride in london in pictures","story":"Huge crowds enjoy the sun and the parade at the city’s annual LGBT Pride celebration."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Measures include unannounced inspections, and banning use of portable cages as kennelsResident says: \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom just horrified and disgusted.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Unannounced inspections of dog breeding establishments are among a series of new measures to be introduced to deal with the growing number of puppy farms in Ireland.The guidelines, published after lengthy delays including an extended consultation process, come into effect from January 2019.They include stronger provisions for animal welfare, breeding limits, kennel sizes, exercise areas, socialisation of animals, staffing levels and training, registration and record keeping.The regulations aim to combat Ireland’s reputation as the puppy farm capital of Europe following exposés of industrial-scale premises where breeding bitches were housed like battery hens, with no rest time between litters.A BBC Panorama programme two years ago highlighted a case involving an industrial-scale puppy farm in Co Cavan.The guidelines – contained in a 20-page document - states bitches must not give birth to more than six litters of pups each, and not more than three litters during any three year period.There is heavy emphasis in the plan on dog housing and the use of portable crates, cages or boxes as kennels is to be banned.Animals must have kennels with enough space for each dog to “feed, sleep, sit, wag their tails, stand.lie with limbs extended, stretch and move about unimpeded or without touching the sides of the kennel”.And the guidelines require breeders to have an exercise and socialisation programme which includes human contact.Dog breeders must register with their local authority and keep detailed records of their animals.Minister of State for Rural and Community Affairs Seán Kyne, who published the guidelines, said he was happy that local authority vets would be able to make unannounced inspections.“Better socialised pups, housed in appropriate accommodation, make for better pets. Where there is a focus on socialisation in the key first few weeks of life, there is a smoother transition to life in a family home.”The Minister said he wanted to see “the highest possible standards achieved by dog breeding establishments”.He said apart from the guidelines, dog breeding establishments also have to comply with health and safety and animal welfare legislation.A wider review of animal welfare legislation will take place later this year and will consider which department will have overall responsibility for animal welfare.Currently the Departments of Community and Rural Affairs, Agriculture and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht all have a role while Mr Kyne’s department has specific responsibility for dog breeding establishments.A dog breeding establishment is defined as one with at least six bitches, aged six months or older, used for breeding."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558068.1531060207!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"t%C3%A1naiste uk brexit proposals could be basis for serious negotiations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney: I don’t think Britain will get everything it’s asking for.Britain’s new proposals for leaving the EU could be the basis for a serious negotiation “but it’s far from a done deal”, according to Tánaiste Simon Coveney. He said the EU will not accept Britain’s Brexit plans “in full”, but the EU had always stated that once Britain softened its red lines “which were contradictory, that they would also show some generosity and flexibility”.Mr Coveney added: “But I think there will be limits to that flexibility. I don’t think Britain will get everything it’s asking for here but I certainly hope that it can be the base of a real negotiation.”Speaking on RTÉ’s This Week radio programme, Mr Coveney said there would be concern that British was essentially “picking and choosing what elements of the Single Market they want to be part of”.The proposals agreed by British prime minister Theresa May’s cabinet include aligning the UK to the single market for goods and agriculture but not services. It also proposes remaining in a complex customs arrangement with the EU with the intention of having a seamless border between North and South.But there is concern at the proposal to separate the four single market freedoms on goods, services, capital and labour.Mr Coveney, who is Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, said the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and others had always been very concerned about that “a la carte” approach.“From an EU perspective we have to ensure that the integrity of the single market and customs union remains intact and that Ireland is very much part of that.“But what we’re seeing here is certainly a move in the right direction from Britain and I think that will be taken seriously on the EU side.”The negotiations would not be easy with the next round of formal discussions taking place on Monday July 16th, when there would be a detailed EU response.He said there would be an intensification of negotiations when they needed to finalise a text of the withdrawal treaty, including a backstop on the border issue.“But I think it will be easier to move that forward now given the changed British position.”He welcomed what he called positive “strong language” including that Britain is “absolutely committed to what we call the backstop but more importantly they are determined to ensure the backstop will never be necessary, which has always been Ireland’s preference.“We want a future relationship that’s so comprehensive between the UK and the EU that doesn’t require any border checks either on the island of Ireland or East-West between Ireland and Britain.“That’s what Theresa May is now indicating that she wants too.”The backstop would keep Northern Ireland aligned to the EU regulatory framework in the event that there was no agreement between the EU and UK.“We don’t want to have to use an insurance mechanism like a backstop in future, but we will continue to insist that backstop remains part of any withdrawal treaty just in case negotiations break down.”The British government is expected to publish its 90-page white paper detailing its proposals on Wednesday or Thursday this week.Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said that to make preparations for a no deal Brexit “is not admitting defeat and would not undermine the negotiation or our position”.The Mayo TD said Ireland had to prepare for all eventualities and the message “was fed strongly to all member states” after the last EU Council meeting “that they must now prepare for all possible eventualities including a hard Brexit”.Ms Chambers said “I am concerned that we haven’t the necessary skills that would be required in the event of a hard Brexit.“I don’t think the Government are stepping up preparations quickly enough because it’s my view that the backstop was oversold last December.“That had a consequence because it effectively told our citizens, our farming community our business community that everything was going to be fine and they didn’t need to prepare.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

There is little mention of them and their role at the RAF Museum in Hendon and nothing to recognise what they did as part of the 100th Anniversary commemorations.”Mrs Atkins, a teacher from Taunton, Somerset, added: “My mother and the other women made a huge contribution to the war, delivering the planes to the pilots from the factories and then becoming the first women to get their RAF wings.”The History of the Royal Air ForceJackie Wetherill, who is planning to make a documentary about The Famous Five, said: “these women were the first to get their wings with the RAF as a result of the huge amount of hours they flew delivering planes during the war.“What they did was astonishing. They had barely any training, no radio contact and no weaponry, yet they flew fighter planes hot off the production line to the airbases where they were so desperately needed to defend Britain. It\u0027s a shame so little is being done to recognise their role.”Mrs Atkins was angered during a recent visit to the RAF museum at Hendon when she says she was told that the museum didn’t need any material about her mother, as there were already “a few women dotted around here and there”.She said it appeared to be indicative of the neglect the women have suffered over the years.Royal Air Force centenary: A look back over 100 years of the RAF, in picturesTheir roles were not limited to the crucial task of delivering planes for battle.Mrs Moggridge served in a top-secret mission helping to test the new Radar system. Mrs Leaf served as a nurse, then moved into analysing damaged aircraft engines to improve their design. Benedetta Willis juggled flying with raising a young family, while Joan Hughes trained men and women to a range of military aircraft. “They were all pioneers and should be recognised as such.” said Mrs Atkins.An RAF spokesperson said: “The RAF 100 celebrations are a chance to remember all those who have served in the RAF, including the women who have contributed so much to keeping our country safe over the last 100 years. On Tuesday we are proud to have Group Captain Anne-Marie Houghton as the Parade Commander leading the pinnacle of the celebrations though London. “Women have featured heavily in the RAF 100 campaign, including in the BBC Women at War programme and the Air Transport Auxiliary, which included women who transported planes during WWII, recently met the Prime Minster at 10 Downing Street at a commemorative event.”Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Four boys rescued\u0026#39 from Thai cave, officials say hours after operation to free trapped boys beganTurkey fires thousands of civil servants ahead of Erdogan\u0026#39s swearing-inMiss America factions clash over decision to ditch swimsuit roundCar cabin pollution scare prompts calls for new air conditioning rulesRobbie Williams\u0026#39 daughter \u0026#39will be flower girl\u0026#39 at Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s weddingThe Jungle review, Playhouse Theatre – the most important play in the West EndNovichok fears drive panicked Salisbury residents to A\u0026ampEBritain will walk away from the EU unless it reciprocates \u0026#39flexibility\u0026#39 shown by Theresa May, Michael Gove warnsFalstaff review, Royal Opera House –  despite an excellent cast, this production fails to scintillateComment: I was falsely accused of a sex crime.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their behaviour has been unforgivable.”Open warfare erupted among Tories with MPs of all factions at each others’ throats.It wasn’t just the PM and Cabinet Remainers who bore the brunt of their anger.The seven Brexit ministers were branded “cowards” for refusing to resign rather than back the soft Brexit plan.They in turn, railed against former Remainer ministers – including Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson - who had publicly declared they now support Brexit.One minister said: “They are all talk and no trousers. When the going got tough the deserted us.”Brexit cheerleader Boris Johnson was blasted for failing to quit the Cabinet.The reputations of Trade supremo Liam Fox and Brexit Secretary David Davis have also plummeted among the troops.An ally of Mr Johnson said: “The only people who would benefit from Boris leaving Cabinet would be Barnier, Merkel, Selmayr and the rest of those negotiating for the EU.“There is no doubt that we would be heading for an even softer Brexit had Boris not been around the Cabinet table – and it could still get worse.“This is why he is determined to continue in his role and make the argument for Brexiteers.”Another pal added: “Boris accepts Cabinet responsibility but still wants to be there and fighting.Another said Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s leadership ambitions had been “shot to bits” for leaving Brexit colleagues “high and dry” at Friday’s summit.Backbench MPs will decide this week whether they can muster the numbers to try to oust the PM.They need 48 to force a confidence vote – but it is thought they will struggle to raise the numbers.There were mounting suspicions that a deal was stitched up by EU-friendly civil servants and their colleagues in Brussels which would be easier to drive through in talks later this month.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “I have deep concerns that this is not what the British public voted for.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen added: “The government’s Brexit position is very weak beer, even before the EU start to water it down even further.”“If he leaves, the plan is only going to get softer. He will strongly resist any further creep in that direction.”Mr Davis spoke to EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday to talk through the Chequers proposals.Jacob Rees-Mogg said the deal could be “worse” than a “no deal” Brexit and suggested it broke the Conservatives’ manifesto promises.Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of a 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said tying the UK with EU rules and regulations could make “trade deals almost impossible”.“As with eggs: an egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all,” he said. “A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker.“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.”Mr Rees-Mogg said he was waiting to see the full details of the proposals to check if Theresa May’s previously-drawn red lines had turned “pink” but said that if the legislation shows it will be a “punishment Brexit” then it will be effectively “keeping us in the European Union in all but name”.“The Prime Minister will, I’m sure, stick to her word - that is crucially important - but I will certainly stick to the Conservatives’ manifesto commitments and will not vote for something that doesn’t deliver Brexit.”“It is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit, Mr Rees-Mogg said.Sir Bill Cash told BBC’s Newsnight he was “deeply disappointed, to say the least” and the plans “raise a lot of very serious questions”.Meanwhile, Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary and Brexiteer, said: “I didn’t campaign to leave the European Union to have a different specification of motor car on sale in the UK to the one that’s on sale in France.“This is simply saying that we will effectively sell the same products across Europe as we do now – it’s what business does and would do anyway, nobody produces a different product for one country.”Nigel Dodds, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, praised Mrs May’s proposals and said: “The Government’s commitment at Chequers to the political and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom with no borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom is a welcome reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us.The Government’s failure to plan for “no deal” and the PM’s dithering has forced us into doing a lot of the EU’s work for them, watering down a genuinely clean Brexit into an unambitious fudge.But we have now, finally, put the ball in Brussels’ court. And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.“Most sensible people recognise that it would be economically catastrophic as well as politically unacceptable to hive Northern Ireland off into some kind of hybrid status within the EU. That is not going to happen.”However, he also warned the Government “must deliver on what the people of the United Kingdom voted for in the referendum, namely, control of our borders, our laws and our money” - adding that the DUP will be checking the “fine print” of the White Paper when it is published next week. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Luckily, we have some expert turd-polishers in this government.”His colourful outburst came as he caved in to Mrs May’s demand to get behind her blueprint for a soft Brexit.Boris threw in the towel after a 12-hour battle to reshape the proposal, which will tie Britain to a swathe of EU rules.But he could barely disguise his disappointment at signing up to a Remainer-inspired deal.He said: “It’s been a tough day for a Brexiteer.”He led the charge by Eurosceptic ministers to toughen the list of demands to be presented at exit talks in Brussels on July 16.One who was present said: “They all put up a brave fight but they were outnumbered and worn down during a long, hard day.“In the end, their resistance just fizzled out and they signed up to the package.”Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey argued passionately for a much harder starting position.She was backed by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt. But their resistance weakened when Environment Secretary Michael Gove agreed to the PM’s plan.The summit’s mood lightened as, one by one, the Brexiteers were picked off.One minister even pulled out a family pack of Haribo Supermix and passed it around the debating table.When they reached Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has just launched a drive to tackle child obesity, he told colleagues: “I should take these off you.”Boris had warned that taking rules from Brussels while having no say inside the EU would reduce Britain to a colony of a European superstate. He is reported to have said: “It would reduce us to a ­vassal state.“We’ve been blaming many of our problems over the past 30 years on EU-imposed legislation. We are now saying we need to keep all these regulations as they are vital to our economic health.”But other ministers teamed up to convince him that while he might not like this version of Brexit, it is better than that on offer from a Remain-supporting Parliament.An insider said: “It was a bit like a hung jury where two or three are holding out against the majority.“It finally dawned on Boris and others that they could stay up all night arguing but in the end the only two options would be to sign up to Theresa’s plan or resign.”But we have now, finally, put the ball in Brussels’ court.

And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement - free movement will end.They wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK - that will end.They wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders - and thats exactly what we will do.But well do it in a way that protects and enhances our economy for the future.Tories are being invited to briefings about the plans, with the Prime Minister set to address Conservative MPs at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.The first briefing was led by Chief Whip Julian Smith and Mrs Mays chief of staff Gavin Barwell, with 10 Tory MPs attending the Saturday morning session.It comes a day after May reportedly threatened to sack Boris Johnson after claiming her crushing victory over Brexiteer ministers.The Prime Minister is said to have promised allies she will not tolerate any attempt by the Foreign Secretary to undermine the deal.The Times revealed her threat to Boris following a marathon all-day summit at her Buckinghamshire country retreat, at which they agreed a Soft Brexit 12-point plan that will tie Britain to Brussels rules for goods and mirror EU judges diktats.In a letter to Conservative MPs later, May made clear that ministers who complained about her plan would be sacked.She said: “As we developed our policy on Brexit I have allowed cabinet colleagues to express their individual views.Agreement on this proposal marks the point where that is no longer the case and collective responsibility is now fully restored.It followed fears Mr Johnson would lead half-a-dozen Eurosceptics to quit.May appears to have faced down Brexiteer Cabinet ministers after securing agreement on plans which will keep the UK closely aligned to Brussels.The proposals will now be assessed by the European Union.But under the Governments plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.Brussels will be reluctant to support any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a no deal Brexit.But Mrs May said she hoped the proposals, which will be produced in a formal White Paper next week, would enable talks with the EU to move forward.Pro-Brexit groups were scathing of the PMs Brexit blueprint.In a withering assessment Leave Means Leave boss John Longworth said the PM had totally misled 17.4million voters and branded her plans a fake Brexit.However, business leaders, who have raised concerns about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy, welcomed the Cabinet agreement.Despite the plan, Mrs Mays position could still be under threat from Tory Brexiteers.Backbencher Andrea Jenkyns said she was awaiting the detail of the plans before deciding whether or not to support calls for a leadership contest."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjA4MTsiGN_4355363.jpg?20180706221224 ","title":"chequers mate brexiters rely on eu rejecting pms win","story":"More than that, as was made clear in an email to MPs afterwards, for the first time since February 2016, cabinet collective responsibility on Brexit was firmly reasserted.No more special licence for ministers to speak their mind on this issue. Any minister freelancing with long personal manifestos or private recorded statements will be fired.Other delighted cabinet ministers included Business Secretary Greg Clark, defender of Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover, who said it was a \"very positive conclusion\" which meant \"zero friction\" for trade between UK and EU countries and Justice Secretary David Gauke, who praised the \"positive support from cabinet for Theresa May and her Brexit plan\".Not much from the Brexiteers just yet.:: \u0027Sell out\u0027 free trade area plans torn apart by BrexiteersThe statement of agreement was emailed to the press as dinner began, without cabinet ministers having contact with their advisers, giving two hours for newspapers to conjure \"PM wrestles Brexit triumph\" style headlines, on a day when most of the country will want to return to the World Cup, rather than squabbling political parties.The European Union will not accept this plan, and that much has been made clear.But that was easy for them while there was no plan and no unified position even to have to consider.Now there is something for them to bite into. A conversation to be started. Their initial response to actually having a negotiation partner was warmish. But they were careful not to sound too dismissive about the wider attempt to enjoy existing economic terms with the single market where the UK feels it is in its interest, without the payments or adherence to freedom of movement.The most significant piece of the agreement is that the government has changed its position on what it wants from ongoing trade with the European Union.No longer is it \"as frictionless as possible\", which was always fairly meaningless but actually \"frictionless\".The PM has been persuaded by the arguments of business, the car industry and Airbus in particular, that any border checks would fundamentally imperil the business strategies that have led them to thrive in the UK and in particular their supply chains.The answer is a \"free trade area for goods\" with a common rule book which is in essence participation in a goods customs union and single market, with some eventual flexibility to conduct independent trade externally, when tariff tracking technology is developed.:: Behind the scenes of crunch Brexit talksIt is not membership of these structures however.The UK becomes rule-taker of the EU interpretation of these rules for globalised industries.The theory, however, is that the UK will have had strong influence in the setting of the global standards in the first place, so not a total rule-taker.It is a position that envisages the development in coming decades of global standards in advanced manufacturing and trade. The inclusion of agriculture in this system is to keep borders open both in Northern Ireland and at Dover, Holyhead and the Channel Tunnel.The gravitational pull on any future government not to change tariffs will be strong, but the UK parliament will have the power to change them.Britain will have taken back some control, but in other senses (directly influencing the EU rules) have lost it.Brexiteer backbenchers were restrained immediately, but anger is brewing. \"As bad as I feared,\" said one.A despondent Brexiteer MP said he was \"deeply disappointed, this is associate membership of the EU, we haven\u0027t worked so hard all these years for this\".One very pro-Brexit junior minister told me: \"If this was the final deal, then I could probably live with it as a necessary compromise. But EU will never accept it (cherry picking, four freedoms indivisible etc), so what happens next?\" Indeed why you would choose to lay out such tough red lines if you thought things might end up here is a bit of a mystery.How Brexiteer cabinet ministers have signed up to this having argued so publicly for \"a clean Brexit\" is another.\"I can\u0027t see how they can accept this and not look a laughing stock,\" one former senior minister said.It is early days yet. One ministerial aide suggested the analogy of a budget that unravels after a time delay of two days, would be the correct analogy.The most evident possible method for that is the section on a \"labour mobility partnership\" which suggests maintaining mutual freedom to move and then apply for study and jobs [presumably not benefits] between UK and EU.

Parliament was key to her argument.

And that too is why the Brexiteers broke bread with the prime minister last night rather than flouncing out.

Visitors must leave by 25 July. To order one you must hold a match ticket, even if you don\u0027t actually intend on attending the game.The UK Foreign Office told Sky News that the process of applying for a Fan ID once a match ticket has been purchased is quick and an electronic version is suitable to travel on. A physical version can be picked up in Russia.Travellers also must have a passport valid for the duration of their trip.The Foreign Office website advises that if travelling on a British passport issued since January 2017, it must be signed with a black pen before anyone travels as some British nationals who haven\u0027t signed theirs have been denied entry into Russia. I\u0027ve got my documents, how do I get there?Bear in mind that the main international airport (Sheremetyevo) is around two hours from Luzhniki Stadium by public transport. It is around half that by car - on a good day.If you\u0027re travelling from London, the latest you could leave is probably the 10.40am departure from Heathrow, which arrives in Moscow at 4.25pm. But this will set you back \u0026#1631,968, according to Kiwi.A cheaper option is \u0026#163532 for a flight just under four hours, which lands in Moscow at 4.50pm.Manchester options on the day of the game are less plentiful if you want to catch every moment. A flight arriving at 5.05pm will take five hours and 45 minutes, setting you back \u0026#163615. There\u0027s a six-hour journey arriving at 3.20pm for about the same price. I don\u0027t want to fly, how else can I get there?If you have the endurance, driving will take you around 29 hours - it\u0027s about1,800 miles.

The most popular route would be to get the Eurostar to Brussels and then further trains to Cologne and Berlin.You\u0027ll probably need to overnight in Berlin before the morning journey to Warsaw, which takes around six hours. Later on day two, you would catch a sleeper train from Warsaw to Moscow. But beware, these trains only run on certain days of the week. Will there be anywhere for me to stay?Moscow is Russia\u0027s capital city and, as well as the big game, you could easily spend some more time there enjoying the historic centre, the architecture, shopping, museums and other activities.The 2016 population estimate was 12.19 million people.Accommodation options include hostels from \u0026#1635 per person per night, three-star accommodation ranging from around \u0026#163120 to \u0026#163280, and the luxury end of the scale for more than \u0026#1632,000.Do I need to speak Russian to get around?The fan zones are equipped to deal with English speakers.

Keir Starmer described the Cabinet compromise as a fudge. Speaking to the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr he said: We\u0027ve argued for a comprehensive customs union with the EU. The Prime Minister has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid that and come up with this plan which is not going to work. He said of the plan: It\u0027s got fudge written all over it. The Labour frontbencher called on Theresa May to put the plan which was hammered out at Chequers on Friday to a vote in the House of Commons.  I challenge the Prime Minister to put it to a vote. It comes as leading Brexiteer Michael Gove accused the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr of asking fake questions as he struggled to defend the PM\u0027s new plan. The Environment Secretary was asked about the UK\u0027s future relationship with the European Courts of Justice - which many people who voted to Leave see as a red line for leaving the EU. The veteran interviewer asked Mr Gove if he could guarantee that the ECJ would have no influence on British public life going forward. The Government minister instead insisted that the ECJ would have an influence on Britain even if we had never joined the continental bloc because it would influence how we got goods and services into their markets. Mr Marr said in response: I think this is fake sovereignty. To which Mr Gove replied: I think you are wrong - I think that is a fake question.   Brexit: Theresa May\u0027s plan finally revealed as she reaches \u0027agreement\u0027 with warring Tories at Chequers summit  Asked if the deal was everything he hoped for, Mr Gove told BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show: No, but then I\u0027m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn\u0027t, you shouldn\u0027t make the perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the Cabinet.  He added: All those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit , and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the Prime Minister in order to negotiate that deal.  In a bid to solve the Northern Ireland issue, she now wants to keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - which critics had feared would make it harder to get a US trade deal.

The Party faced a backlash from many Jewish groups and supporters last week when it unveiled new guidelines for tackling anti-Jewish sentiment. Critics say the new rules stop short of incorporating the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Jewish abuse. But the Party insists that their own guidelines actually go much further. Today the shadow Brexit Secretary stressed the importance of listening to those criticisms.  I think we need to reflect on what\u0027s been said in the last few days and if we\u0027re not in a position of supporting the full definition we need to get into that position and sharpish, he told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr.  Although Labour adopted the IHRA definition in 2016 it did not accept the examples which accompany it. This has been widely criticised. Keir Starmer said: I believe in the full definition. Councils, institutions across the country have accepted the full definition and I think that\u0027s the right position to be in. Asked why he thought Labour hadn\u0027t adopted it, he replied: There\u0027s some argument as to whether Labour has or hasn\u0027t but I would urge everybody within the Labour Party to listen to the voices that have come out in recent days and get to a position where we are supporting the full definition. I think it\u0027s really important - including the examples. We have to be really clear about our position on this. Labour\u0027s new general secretary Jennie Formby has defended the party\u0027s new guidance - saying it went further than the IHRA rules. Ms Formby, who Jeremy Corbyn has asked to stamp out antisemitism, said: I have been asked why we didn’t just adopt the IHRA’s examples as they are and leave it at that. The answer is that they do not go far enough for practical use by a political party.  Our guidelines address all of the ground covered by the IHRA examples, clarifies those that might be open to different interpretations or be seen as conflicting with other rights, and provides additional examples of anti-Semitic language and behaviour.  But asked this morning whether the party should rewrite the code after feedback from the Jewish community, Mr Starmer said: I think we need to reflect on what\u0027s been said in the last few days and if we are not in a position of supporting the full definition we need to get into that position and sharpish.

The Party\u0027s official position is not to back a second poll but Jeremy Corbyn is under increasing pressure to change this stance.  Scores of his own MPs back another vote, large swathes of the membership and the influential Momentum group back another vote. While last week Labour\u0027s biggest financial backer the Unite union left the door open to supporting one - after a majority of members at its policy conference backed one. On Friday Sir Keir Starmer said his party was not calling for another vote, but we\u0027re not ruling out a second referendum. Today he repeated that position when speaking to the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr.   He said: In the event that Article 50 is voted down or there is no deal, that is a serious situation. Parliament should decide what happens next.   And at that stage, there could be a general election, there could be other options, but all options, it seems to me, ought to be on the table.  It comes after Theresa May secured a hard won and fragile compromise on the government\u0027s position on the future relationship with the EU after an away day at Chequers. The vulnerable PM broke the deadlock by coming up with a peace offering for both the Remain and Leave camps. In a bid to solve the Northern Ireland issue, she now wants to keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods.  This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - which critics had feared would make it harder to get a US trade deal. The PM claimed this will help the UK avoid friction in trade - protecting jobs and businesses. But in a desperate bid to prevent Brexiteers resigning, she also said Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules.  The olive branch to the Brexiteers means Mrs May remains vulnerable - because there is no guarantee the EU will accept her new plan.

The PM, due to address all 316 Tory MPs on Monday, is expecting enough of them to oppose her to mount a no-confidence vote on her leadership. But she relishes the opportunity to finally end the plotting against her. An aide told the Sunday Mirror: “Once it’s done, it’s done.” Although Mrs May got her new Brexit plan through Cabinet without any walkouts, ministers fear it will be rejected by Brussels. Europe goes on holiday in August. So only six weeks remain before an agreement must be reached at the EU Council summit in October.  Ministers have now stepped up their planning for a no-deal Brexit – while chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier is waiting to see whether the new proposal is “workable and realistic”. Brexit rebel leader Jacob Rees-Mogg warned he “will not vote for something which doesn’t deliver Brexit”. Graham Brady, chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, is believed to be just six letters short of the 48 needed to trigger a vote of no \u0026shyconfidence in the PM. If Mrs May lost a vote she would have to stand down and there would be a leadership contest. But Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith, who briefed 40 MPs on the fudge yesterday, believes Mrs May would win a vote easily.

Already faced with prices soaring by more than \u0026pound1,000 during the school holiday peak, lone parents say the \u0026shyadditional hike can make it impossible to take their children away. And operators such as Jet 2, Tui and First Choice can make the problem worse – as offers of free child places only apply if two paying adults travel with them. Single parent groups say the policy is “unfair” and “out of touch”. We found a one week all-inclusive stay at Bulgaria’s SuneoClub Odessos, \u0026shyflying from Manchester on July 27, costs \u0026pound1,572 for two adults with a free child’s place via First Choice.  But for just one adult and one child, the price is exactly the same. When selecting one adult, the ad for free child places disappears from the site. Airtours offers “child prices” for some hotels – but only when sharing a room with at least two adults paying full price. Thomas Cook Holidays has the same pricing policy. And because the firms do not count children in the room rate, a single parent can be charged an under-occupancy supplement. But it is not just accommodation – other firms also hit single parents with increased fares. A First Choice holiday to the Holiday Village Rhodes for seven nights cost an extra \u0026pound515 per person for a single adult with one child.

Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

Lesley Hutchings says she had her passport taken away and her bank accounts emptied after being held for four days over allegations of defrauding customers. Lesley, 54, was quizzed by French authorities about the cream – which she makes in her barn. The product sells on Facebook for up to \u0026pound40. Police who raided her home in the remote Manche area of Nor\u0026shymandy removed computers and paperwork before sealing up the outbuilding. Officials then took away samples of her MAFactive cream for tests. Lesley – a former accountant who has no formal medical qualifications – says two of the creams have been ruled “satisfactory”, while a third is still being analysed.  Police also quizzed her over her association with David Noakes, who is facing trial over a controversial product called GcMAF – which his company promotes as the “body’s way of becoming cancer free”. Noakes is due in court in the UK later this year on charges of money laundering and manufacturing a medicine without a licence. When the Sunday People visited Lesley at her home, which she hopes to turn into a vegan B\u0026ampB, she insisted her cream does not contain GcMAF, despite the similar name. Lesley told us: “It’s just a name. What difference does it make? It could mean anything – multi-formula cream or whatever.” And she accused the French authorities of victimising her because she once worked with Noakes. Lesley said: “I ran a legitimate business with zero complaints from customers and positive feedback. “I don’t tell people my cream cures cancer. I don’t make any health claims. It’s not illegal to make something amazing – and it’s not illegal for others to tell the world you’ve made something amazing. One Polish woman wrote that she used my cream for tumours that had turned all fungal and said that three weeks later they were gone.  “I don’t even understand why my creams work because science says they shouldn’t work.” Lesley moved to France in 2011 after quitting her job with Noakes, which involved collating customer feedback on GcMAF. She began making her own cream three years ago. Claiming its exact contents are “a trade secret”, she would say only that it contains frankincense and yeast. Her Facebook page promoting the product stated it may help the body “defend itself against pathogens and cancers”. Facebook declined to comment on Lesley using the social networking site to promote her business. She says her business came under scrutiny by French authorities after she posted customer feedback to a private page – including the claims of the woman who said the cream had got rid of skin tumours. Lesley’s premises were raided in February last year – and she is still on bail. She said: “When I got out of prison my passport had been taken away, the banks had been cleared out and I was \u0026pound3,000 overdrawn. “I went from having a wonderful business I loved working in, even though I was doing 70 hours a week, to having it ripped out from under me and being bankrupt – all without a single day in court. This is French justice.  “I don’t feel I’d want to support France any more, a country so abusive to human rights. It’s comparable to Turkey.” On a Facebook page to promote her cream she writes: “This not only ensures healthy skin, but may also help to enable the body to fight off infections, repair and renew its cells and defend itself against pathogens and cancers.” Lesley’s daughter Jasmin raised \u0026pound10,000 from a crowdfunding page to help pay her mum’s legal fees. She said people had described the cream as “almost supernatural”. After her home was raided Lesley was taken to Paris, where a judge questioned her association with Noakes, who claims GcMAF can cure cancer. The so-called miracle drug contains a vitamin D binding protein called glycoprotein, which it is claimed boosts the immune system to help the body fight cancer naturally. Small clinical trials in Japan were dismissed by other experts as they did not take scans of patients’ tumours or analyse their immune systems. But online enthusiasts insist it is a “miracle cure” that is being suppressed by drugs manufacturers. The unlicensed drug is banned in the UK. GcMAF is marketed by Noakes’s Guernsey-based company, Immuno Biotech. The firm’s website claims GcMAF treats a range of conditions, from allergies and asthma to Crohn’s disease, HIV, Parkinson’s disease and autism.

The government is believed to be drawing up a new list of items that must be put in the hold. It comes after Australia, the US and New Zealand introduced similar bans last month. They adopted the new rules after Australian officials were rocked by a foiled plot to blow up an Ethiad flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi last year. Islamic State sent the sophisticated device from Syria to a terror cell in Sydney hidden in a meat mincer.  A major terror attack may only have been averted when the suitcase was abandoned at check-in, possibly because it was too heavy. The Times reports that the new rules could bring powders under the same restrictions as liquids. All powders would be restricted to 12 ounces or 56 grams and would have to go through further security checks. The rule on liquids were introduced in the wake of 9/11. However, there are fears the new rules could mean even longer lines at airport security. It comes amid worries that the new UK passports, which are blue in colour, will increase queues at border control. The Department of Transport did not comment on The Times\u0027 report.  A spokesman said: It is for each country to determine its own security measures based on its own assessments. We work closely with all our international partners to keep aviation security under constant review. Mils Hills, an associate professor in risk, resilience and corporate security at the University of Northampton, said: In itself, these extra restrictions are not going to create a lot of disruption at airport security but it has the potential to feed into general concerns by the public about the safety of flying.

A colossal \u0026pound10 billion worth of badly performing SIPPs - Self Invested Personal Pensions - are believed to have been mis-sold to hundreds of thousands of Brits by unscrupulous financial advisors. Now potential victims are being urged to check if they can reclaim huge portions of their lost cash and the government has set up a special \u0026pound120 million fund to compensate losers so far. A maximum \u0026pound50,000 compensation sum is currently available from the large fund managed by The Financial Service Compensation Scheme and the figure is set to rise by 75 per cent to a \u0026pound85,000 maximum in the next nine months as claims grow. However industry figures such as pension expert Zoe Pearson warn that the true cost of mis-sold pensions is closer to \u0026pound10 billion and will sweep the country like the current phenomenon of PPI claims that has gripped the nation over the past few years.  Read more: Taxed to death: The astonishing amount of income tax people pay decades after leaving work for the last time Miss Pearson, who heads the country’s all female team of claim specialists Pension Claim Consulting Ltd , told : “Thousands upon thousands of people are unaware they’ve been mis-sold SIPPS. Unless you know what to look for it’s difficult to know what a mis-sale is although quite often when people realise they’ve been mis-sold to, they’re too embarrassed to take action. “However, the financial services industry has firm rules, so any mis-sale should be pursued. “Even basic calculations give you an idea of the true scale of this scandal. Average compensation for mis-sales sit at around \u0026pound25,000 for private pensions and \u0026pound50,000 for final salary pensions so the total figure for the mis-sales of SIPPs is going to be around the \u0026pound10bn mark. “In fact if this was brought to the forefront and the government advised people to check the status of their pensions that might even be an underestimation. The government needs to launch an investigation to unearth the true amount.” Labour MP Frank Field has hit out at the SIPP conmen and vowed to bring the industry into line whilst industry experts reveal the true figure of mis-selling is growing at an unprecedented rate and the true loss of mis-selling will run into billions as the number of victims rocket.  Shocking 30.4million Brits face disappointment when they finally get to stop working - the plan to fix it The Financial Ombudsman however are allowed to raise their compensation ceiling and can award up to a further maximum of \u0026pound150,000 for many cases. The SIPP scams involved unscrupulous Financial Advisors preying on savers who were promised massive returns of up to 20 per cent a year only for their savings to be squandered on get rich quick schemes including investing in airport parking, holiday properties and green energy projects. The Financial Conduct Authority revealed one in eight savers think an advisor has mis-sold them a financial product such as a pension. The FCA advise people who think they have been mis-sold a pension to raise a complaint as soon as possible as there are time-limits in place which could affect the outcome of your claim. Their report called the Financial Lives Survey was widely praised by industry experts who believe that the government have underestimated the scale of mis-sold pensions such as SIPPs however the Commons Work and Pensions Committee have demanded tighter safeguards to protect savers. Committee Chairman Frank Field MP said: “I am concerned about the role of SIPPs as platforms that help funnel unwitting clients’ pension savings into dodgy and inappropriate investments. SIPPs are happy to skim off their fee on the way but there are serious questions about their commitment to due diligence and consumer protection. “When an unscrupulous financial advisor channels a victim’s money through a SIPP into an investment that then collapses, it is not enough for the SIPP provider to shrug their shoulders and say ‘caveat emptor’. “I will be writing to the FCA to ask what they are doing to ensure SIPPS are not acting as handmaidens to the pension-snatchers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pippa middleton reveals one thing","story":"NewsPippa Middleton reveals the one thing she\u0027s refusing to give up during her pregnancyPippa Middleton is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer17:36, 6 JUL 2018NewsPippa is pregnant with her first child (Image: Rex)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen women find out they\u0027re pregnant, their lives change forever.

Before he became a drugs kingpin, smuggling millions of pounds worth of cocaine and ecstasy pills into the UK, Evans set up his bizarre scam with his wife.   It was while he was serving time for a deception conviction, stemming from his years running his double-glazing business, that he dreamt up the scam . During the BSE scare ostrich meat was seen by many as a low-fat and safe alternative to beef and lamb.   He saw it as an opportunity to make money and shortly after his release from prison, he launched an ostrich farm and breeding-business in Dunvant near Swansea, Wales Online reports.   The Ostrich Centre was advertised in national newspapers with the slogan Ostrich Nest Egg and offered investors the chance to buy an ostrich, promising them big returns of 70 per cent or more on their investment. The simple idea won the backing of more than 100 people, including many pensioners, who were tricked into investing a total of \u0026pound875,000 in the fledging company. While the ostriches themselves were real, Evans was selling each bird several times over to different investors and pocketing the cash from the people he duped. The cash was funnelled off into off-shore bank accounts in Jersey and the Bahamas. Between February and July 1996 investors pumped hundreds of thousands of pounds into the venture, taken-in by Evans\u0027 sales patter. But just six months after being launched, the company was declared insolvent - though not before \u0026pound329,000 had been stolen from investors. When the business was revealed as a scam, a number of angry investors descended on Bevexe Fawr Farm in Dunvant and seized birds to try to recoup some of their money. Auditors nothing in the firm\u0027s bank account - save for a \u0026pound440 overdraft. A police investigation was launched, and the Evanses were subsequently charged with fraud and theft. From running a successful double-glazing business he ended up as a Mr Big of the drugs world, running a gang of cocaine smugglers while living the high-life in a luxury apartment in Marbella. Some of those who knew him - and some of those who were taken in by him - describe him as charming. He was certainly an accomplished liar. Evans grew up in Pontarddulais, and attended Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera in the Swansea Valley. He was said to have left school with few qualifications.  After dabbling with DJing, he ran a video rental shop but his first taste of success came when he launched a double-glazing firm in Neath . Within 18 months the firm was employing 20 people, and in 1987 he scooped the Welsh Young Businessperson of the Year title. Business was good, and Evans and his wife Esther began to enjoy the trapping of success, including Mercedes cars with personalised number plates. So far, it seemed, so good. But the double-glazing business eventually folded, and in 1994 Evans was convicted of obtaining property by deception and sentenced to 15 months in prison. Evans saw an opportunity to make money. And the story may well have ended there, as just another scheme that indeed proved too good to be true. But just as the trial was about to start in 2000, Martin Evans faxed Swansea Crown Court to say he would not be attending - in fact the 38-year-old had skipped the country and run away to Spain with his mistress. His wife was left to face the charges alone. The money in the offshore accounts had also vanished, meaning investors lost everything - apart from those who had indulged in a spot of unofficial Swansea ostrich wrangling. The case against Mrs Evans, who is originally from Brynamman , went ahead in her husband\u0027s absence - she was found guilty of four charges of theft and one of fraudulent trading, and given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Judge Michael Burr told the court he had no doubt the ostrich farm had been a scam from the very beginning. He said: I am satisfied that the whole ostrich farm was set up from the beginning as a dishonest means of depriving investors of their money.  The judge told Mrs Evans that he did not believe she was the innocent dupe she had pretended to be, but he accepted that she had been manipulated by her husband. As for the on-the-run Evans, after video rentals, double glazing, and ostrich farming fraud, he became involved in a new and highly lucrative kind of business - international drug dealing. From a hideaway in Spain he masterminded a multi-million-pound drugs and money laundering operation, which smuggled huge quantities of cocaine and ecstasy from mainland Europe into Britain. Evans reaped an estimated \u0026pound9million leading a gang of couriers who trafficked the drugs from Holland and Spain to the UK - the money was laundered through a bureau de change next door to the world-famous Harrods store in London. Gang members would carry cocaine into Britain in multiples of one kilo packets, with upwards of 100,000 ecstasy tablets also being carried on each trip. It was a lucrative enterprise. But unbeknown to the gang, police had them under surveillance following a tip-off about the large sums of money they were changing into different currencies. A complex undercover operation saw officers following the couriers as they went about the business, and police even managed to bug the car of Evans\u0027 second-in-command, former soldier Paul Jeffreys from Llanelli. In October 2001, officers swooped on the gang as Jeffreys and his girlfriend, Lucy Kift, handed over \u0026pound145,000 in Dutch guilders to another gang member at a motorway service station near Reading. As officers moved-in, the bug in Jeffreys\u0027 car picked him up saying I have had it. In Jeffreys\u0027 car police found another \u0026pound284,000 worth of guilders and Spanish pesetas. Other members of the gang were then arrested as their operation was dismantled. Evans, however, slipped through the net and remained at large. But his time as a fugitive - his first time as a fugitive, that is - would be short-lived.  Later that year border staff New York\u0027s JKF airport became suspicious of a man who arrived in the country with a passport in the name of Paul Kelly - it was a time of heightened security in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Kelly, it turned out, was one of the alias being used by Evans. The passport proved to be a fake, Interpol were alerted, Evans was arrested, and he was deported to France - where he would spend the next three years in jail before being extradited to Britain to stand trial. While he was in prison in Paris, eight other members of his gang were jailed for a total of 70 years at Swansea Crown Court, with Jeffreys receiving 16 years for trafficking. Judge John Diehl attacked the gang\u0027s ugly, repulsive trade in human misery which had blighted communities across South Wales. One member of the gang, Richard Hughes, of Llansamlet, Swansea, was found to have a loaded Walther handgun in the boot of his car. He was jailed for 10 years. Alan Thomas from Pontardawe was sentenced to seven years, and Steven Summers, from Llanelli, to six years. Three men from Folkestone were also jailed - Jason Flisher got 14 years, Freddy Lawrence 11 years, and Leslie West three years. Kift was jailed for three years - the court heard the 22-year-old had gained little from the operation apart from sorrow. When Evans eventually appeared at Swansea Crown Court it emerged he had been involved in yet another alleged scam, this time involving healthy chocolate bars - but the prosecution said it was not in the public interest to pursue the charges given the sentence the defendant was already facing for the drug conspiracy offences.  Evans was sentenced to a total of 24 years in prison for drugs trafficking and the Ostrich farm scam, and hit with a \u0026pound4.8million confiscation order to reclaim his ill-gotten gains. The court heard that as well as properties in Swansea the defendant had a \u0026pound2million luxury villa in Marbella - complete with a swimming pool and staff - and a penthouse in Miami\u0027s South Beach near Trump Towers. He also bank accounts in Latvia, Antigua, Switzerland, Dominica, and the UK. Simon Flowers, Wales branch commander at the National Crime Agency (NCA), described Evans at the time as a Mr Big. He said: Evans was in control of the Wales market. He was the number one drug importer into Wales in and around that time. No two ways about it. He would also have had significant influence on the rest of UK as well. Evans\u0027 24 year sentence was later reduced to 21 years on appeal. By 2011 Evans was in Erlestoke open prison in Wiltshire, and was being prepared for early release the following year - as part of the arrangements to facilitate his return to the community he was granted re-settlement visits back to Swansea. On one of these trips he took the chance to flee the authorities once more, and again skipped the country. His second period on the run would last much longer that his first. The NCA launched an international manhunt to find him, and put him on the list of the 11 most-wanted British fugitives. It is believed Evans first fled to Northern Cyprus - which had no extradition treaty with Britain - but given Evans\u0027 international connections the search operation included law enforcement agencies across Europe, the Caribbean, and America. It took three years to find the elusive Evans.

Thousands of products – including pasta, biscuits, crisps and cake bars – past their “best before” dates are being snapped up at bargain prices. The new service is operated by Fultons Foods, which hopes it will reduce the amount of perfectly usable produce that gets binned. An astonishing seven million tonnes of food is thrown away in the UK every year, of which three-\u0026shyquarters, or five million tonnes, could still have been safely eaten. Family-run Fultons, which is based in Barnsley, South Yorks, operates 100 stores in the Midlands and North. It sells surplus stock direct from manufacturers at “significantly” lower prices than supermarkets.  The firm’s Karen Gunter said: “An increasing number of UK householders are saving hundreds of pounds by taking advantage of the reality of best before dates. These products are perfectly fine to eat.” “Best before” is a manufacturer’s indication that an item may not be as good quality, but it is not unsafe. Bargains include roast chicken and pasta Mug Shot down from 84p to 29p, Galaxy cake bars down from \u0026pound1 to 79p, bottles of 7 Up lemonade down from \u0026pound1.10 to 59p, and Golden Wonder salt and vinegar crisps from 79p to 50p.  Deliveries, which are made by couriers, are free for groceries costing \u0026pound30 or over. Online retailer Approved Food runs a similar scheme offering 2,000 items near or past “best before” dates. It claims regular customers can save \u0026pound70 on their monthly shop compared to high street prices. The firm’s biggest-selling items include tinned tomatoes and pasta.

Footage has emerged of two supporters in Folkestone, Kent, sitting across a car bonnet as it drives down the road. The topless lads can be seen raising their beverages as the car cruises past elated crowds. But the situation appears to take a turn for the worse when the car approaches two red lights. It doesn\u0027t stop and narrowly misses two women, a young girl and a dog crossing the road.   One of the women, dressed in blue, is forced to quickly step back onto the pavement with her dog while the other jumps out the way. The small child also runs to safety and abandons her scooter in the road as the car misses her by inches. The two men on the bonnet are sent tumbling and one appears to be run over by the car as it continued its journey. Omg that guy\u0027s leg just got run over, bro. And he\u0027s walking it off, one man can be heard saying in the clip. What did I just witness? he repeatedly shouts to his mate who is seen with his hands covering his mouth in shock at what he\u0027s just seen.   Ali Larsen, who posted the video on his Facebook page said: This is just insane. I have reported this incident to the police as I was told to.  I personally hope the guys legs are okay and am very angry at the situation. Bless that child who was nearly hit and witnessed this whole incident. I hope she won\u0027t get too traumatic after nearly being hit. Kent Police has confirmed it is investigating the incident. We have received a report regarding this incident and enquiries are being made, it said.

He is among millions around the country enjoying the Three Lion\u0027s glorious 2-0 victory against Sweden in the World Cup quarter-finals this evening. But not all the celebrations have exactly gone according to plan. In Clapham Junction the jumper joined hundreds lining the streets in the sizzling sunshine chanting and clapping to mark Harry Kane and his team making history. The man - dressed in a blue top and shorts and evidently bursting with pride - clambers on top of a double decker bus and can be seen in a video swinging his arms chanting \u0027ooh ooh.\u0027 He encourages the crowd to join in as he leads the celebrations.  There are cheers as he and another man, dressed in a red top, dance on top of the double deck bus and nearby bus stop roof. And they can be seen swinging their arms, jumping and dancing as they soak up the atmosphere - until the man in blue leaps from the bus onto the bus stop and smashes through the glass roof. The clapping stops and gasps can be heard as he lands smack on the concrete in his side. But miraculously in true Brit style he gets up and walks it off. The glass roof is left hanging, while the man in red - still on the top of the bus stop - appears to question how he can get down safely and avoid the same fate as his pal.  The video which has been posted online has received mixed reactions. One person said: Love how he got up and styled it out, nothing to see here!! Another added: How did he just walk it off. While Brian Kane wrote: The guy with the hat just keeps on clapping as if nothing happened. However, some think he\u0027s gone too far.  Meanwhile, in Southampton a man has been caught surfing across three MOVING double decker buses to celebrate England\u0027s win.

In this instance, the reason wasn\u0027t a zombie apocalypse, nor the outbreak of some terrible virus.  Instead, it was the 3pm England vs Sweden match in Samara, Russia.  While the pubs were heaving, the roads (especially in and out of the capital) were completely empty.  It\u0027s no wonder. 23.8 million viewers tuned in to watch England\u0027s clash with Colombia, and it\u0027s expected that 30 million tuned in to watch England\u0027s 2-0 victory today.

Maya Merhi, eight, is smiling, in good health and learning to walk again following her life-changing treatment, which a doctor carried out for free after learning of her plight. The youngster was born without legs due to a rare congenital condition which her father Mohammed Merhi also has. The 34-year-old used the tuna cans and tubes as make-shift legs to protect his daughter at the refugee camp they fled to after fighting forced them from their home in Aleppo province.  It meant instead of crawling everywhere and being confined to a tent, Maya was finally able to walk outside and even attend the camp\u0027s school. Pictures of her wearing the tuna cans were seen around the world and it prompted such a reaction that the Turkish Red Crescent intervened and the father and daughter were evacuated from Idlib and brought to Istanbul for treatment.

Indian authorities have sealed the home, which is run by the Missionaries of Charity order which was set up by Mother Teresa, and charged a nun and one other person with baby trafficking. The Nirmal Hriday home in eastern India\u0027s Jharkhand state provides shelter for pregnant unmarried women.  Police officer Aman Kumar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: They have said that at least five to six babies have been sold to childless couples. We are investigating to see how the operation was run and how many more children have been given away in the last few years. Arti Kujur, head of the Jharkhand State Child Protection Society, said the home was charging between 40,000 Indian rupees (about \u0026pound440) and 100,000 rupees (about \u0026pound1,100) for each baby, depending on what the childless couple could afford. We had been receiving many complaints regarding the functioning of this home and were keeping a close watch on them for nearly six months, he said. The Missionaries of Charity did not respond to requests for comment. The order stopped organising adoptions in India in 2015 saying they disagreed with government rules that made it easier for single, divorced, and separated people to adopt children. There have been a number of reports of babies and children being trafficked through charity-run homes and hospitals, which campaigners say is driven by a long waiting list for adoption.

Surgeons in Thailand removed one stone of saggy skin from Jennifer Ognenovski\u0027s body following her rapid weight loss. The 23-year-old, who has spent \u0026pound15,000 on surgery including breast implants, had felt like she was trapped with the body of an 80-year-old until she underwent the excess skin operation. She lost a staggering 14 stone (88kg) following a gastric sleeve two years ago to combat years of excess eating that stemmed from childhood.  The law student, from Sydney, Australia, decided to go under the knife for weight loss surgery after fearing she wouldn\u0027t be able to walk or may not even be alive for her graduation. But after her rapid weight loss, she was left with over a stone (6.4kg) of skin hanging from all over her body that looked like crinkled paper and a melted candle. Last year she had surgery from Destination Beauty to remove all her loose skin and give her implants to transform her saggy A-cups to a 32DD - finally allowing her to feel confident in her skin.  Now at a healthy 11st (70kg), she\u0027s set to graduate with the body of her dreams later this year, has a boyfriend and even former bullies are congratulating her on the remarkable transformation. Jennifer, who also works a customer relations officer, said: I felt like I was an 80-year-old woman stuck in a 22-year-old\u0027s body. I needed the skin removal surgery as the skin was affecting my everyday life. The excess skin looked just like crinkled paper, scrunched up clothing and a melted candle. I couldn\u0027t buy clothing in my size as I had so much skin that I would need to alter the sizing and buy things that were too big for my frame to accommodate for the loose skin.  I lost 90kg, and yet, something I always dreamed of, like wearing a sleeveless top was still a dream and it was so disheartening. Not to mention the skin rashes it caused. I had over 1.3kg of skin removed from my arms, 3.5kg removed circumferentially from my abdomen and lower back, 1.2kg removed from my thighs and 400g removed from my breasts. After that I developed a little thing called confidence, something I had never had or experienced before. She added: I was happy to wear things that I always dreamed of, despite the new scars that came with having the surgeries. I was so proud of those scars, as they simply told a story of how I fought the obesity disease and came out stronger on the other end.  I finally feel how I was always meant to feel. There are days where I can\u0027t comprehend or even begin to think of feeling any different to how I feel now. I feel lighter. I am able to exercise, and lift the heavy weights like I always wanted, without being restricted by the loose skin. Jennifer believes her weight gain stemmed from childhood, when she would feel it necessary to finish her plate of food out of politeness and overlook when she was full. This would see her bulge to a hefty 25st (158kg) giving her a shocking BMI reading of 63.7 - putting her into the highest and most dangerous level of obesity. She said: I was brought up in a family where our family gatherings were centred around food. I was always taught from a young age that it was rude to leave food behind.  I misinterpreted this and would always fill my plate to the absolute brim and would go back for seconds. From then, I just loved food, and it always seemed that it was never enough and I was never completely satisfied. At 21 years old, Jennifer was horrified upon realising her weight and realised the extent of her eating problems. Knowing of the health implications caused by severe obesity, she was concerned that all the hard she was ploughing into getting her law degree would all be for nothing. Jennifer said: I was more than half way through my law degree and the thought of completing it but becoming too heavy to even live or walk made me question why I was wasting my time if I wouldn\u0027t be alive in the next five years.  On both sides of my family, my grandparents have diabetes. I wanted to break the cycle and change for the better. After undergoing gastric sleeve surgery, watching her food intake and focusing on protein alongside exercising five times a week, Jennifer was able to lose more than half her bodyweight. But she was plagued by the loose skin hanging from her body that made her feel older than her age and led her to decide that surgery was her only option. Jennifer flew to Destination Beauty in Bangkok, Thailand for a month to have \u0026pound15,000 ($27,000 AUD) worth of surgery to change her life. She had an extended tummy tuck, breast lift and augmentation as well as arm, thigh, flank and mon pubis lift to remove over a stone of excess skin.  Jennifer said: I still have people who on a daily can\u0027t believe that it is me. I get people tell me how amazing I look, however again, it is still a mental game and it is very difficult to train your mind to see what others see. I have a lot of people tell me that I have inspired them to make a change in their own lives, and that to me is everything I could\u0027ve asked for and more. The reason I was successful in my opinion was that I used the surgery as a tool. I exercised five times a week, focused on eating protein and eating regularly and being kind to my body. The sleeve didn\u0027t lose the weight for me, the countless hours in the gym and meal prepping did. I have dropped in the last year to 18 per cent body fat, where initially I had over 55 per cent body fat. Now Jennifer is finishing her final semester of law school and can\u0027t wait to graduate, having completely changed her life. She said: I had people who bullied me during high school and I would hear laugh and make snide comments, congratulate me on my achievements.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"creators of famous viking centre in york to open new exhibit in tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVikings will invade the local area this summer with an exhibition featuring a 15ft boat, a skeleton and a replica ancient Nordic house being staged at Perth Museum.Vikings: Fearsome Craftsmen explores the day-to-day lives of the formidable Norse warriors and the interactive event will introduce visitors to the Viking way of life, including their craft skills.Those who attend the exhibition, which is being run by the creators of the famous Jorvik Viking Centre in York, can also enjoy seeing a 15ft replica Viking fishing boat and an ancient excavated Viking skeleton.Helen Smout, chief executive of Culture Perth and Kinross, urged residents and visitors to “seize the opportunity” to experience what she feels will be a “hit” summer event.She said: “The team at Perth Museum and Art Gallery and across Culture Perth and Kinross have braced ourselves for a very welcome Viking invasion.“The Jorvik Viking Centre is a fantastic step into another time and we are delighted to be hosting an interactive exhibit from the same team, right here in the heart of Scotland.“We look forward to welcoming visitors who have an interest in these incredibly intelligent and creative Norse warriors, and those who are curious to learn more about them in a fun family-friendly environment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f32d41f02e.jpg ","title":"dad of three luke 34 cured of diabetes after 22 years thanks to double transplant","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA dad-of-three says he feels like a “different person” after receiving a double transplant.Luke Chapman, 34, was given a new kidney and pancreas, having suffered from type 1 diabetes for 22 years and then developed kidney disease.He said that since the operation, he has been cured of the condition – and paid tribute to the staff who treated him for more than two decades.Pancreas and kidney transplants are carried out on patients with kidney disease. In Luke’s case, the new kidney has taken over from his own, which hadn’t worked properly since he was diagnosed.In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin, a hormone that controls the blood sugar level in your body. The transplanted pancreas can make insulin and correct this type of diabetes.Luke, an electrician from Montrose, said: “I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 12. I took insulin to control that since I was diagnosed.“Unfortunately, my kidney function dropped quite badly and in 2014 I was diagnosed with kidney disease, and started dialysis in 2016.“I was put on dialysis three days a week, which was quite gruelling. The last two years, on the dialysis, it was a struggle, and started to disrupt my life.“I was still managing to work but I was tired all the time. I was limited to one litre of fluid a day, which is hard, and your diet is restricted as well. There was a large build-up of fluid in my body which is bad for your heart and puts you at risk of a heart attack.\u0026#8220I was on the waiting list for a kidney and pancreas transplant, but was taken off a couple of times, because there is strict criteria that you remain in good health.”Then, on June 2, Luke got a call at 3am telling him to get to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary as medics had found a donor – much to the relief of wife Vicky and children Luiza, 18, Finlay, six and three-year-old Frankie.He said: “In about 90% of cases with transplant, something goes wrong for some reason and the transplant doesn’t go ahead. But at 5.50pm, the doctor came and said, ‘that’s your pancreas here’.“They had harvested it first, before the kidney, but from the same donor.

The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership.

It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

at glebe park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew-look Dundee United looked good as they strolled to victory in the sunshine at Brechin on Tuesday night.Playing what could be the only public friendly of their build-up to the new campaign, the Tangerines started with eight of their nine summer signings.And all impressed as Csaba Laszlo’s men knocked the ball around well and breached the home defence on two occasions.Encouragingly for the several hundred fans who chose to escape England’s World Cup win over Colombia and made the journey to Glebe Park, there was a cohesion about United’s play that probably no one had a right to expect so early in the rebuilding process that’s been undertaken since the disappointment of missing out on promotion at the end of last season.What was apparent within a few minutes of kick-off was Laszlo has added strength and energy to his squad.From a defence that was well marshalled by Frederic Frans to a front line led ably by Craig Curran, the team looked sharp and powerful.Frans looks exactly the kind of dominant defender that was needed to replace Bilel Mohsni, who’d done so well during his short stay towards the end of last term.And out wide Callum Booth showed his Premiership quality at left-back, while Sam Wardrop on the right did enough to suggest he will be an able replacement for his former Celtic youth team-mate Anthony Ralston.In the middle of the park Austrian Christoph Rabitsch added bite, while ahead of him Curran and Nicky Clark showed good understanding for their first outing up front together.Elsewhere, wide man Fraser Aird was first to show what he can bring to the team when he picked up the ball 40 yards from goal and jinked his way past several challenges before netting with a low shot.That opener came with just seven minutes or so on the clock but already United were knocking the ball around in the manner their gaffer likes.It wasn’t just about the new boys, however, and the few familiar faces in the line-up gave a good account of themselves.Sam Stanton was his usual industrial self in midfield and used the ball well. Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5 million.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Milne said: “It has been a fantastic response from the fans and it just shows you the commitment out there from them.“Lots of them are buying season tickets and signing up for DNA.“It is a great initiative and will help strengthen that bond between the club and the fans.“It will enable the fans to feel that they are much more part of the club.“As time goes past that is something that can be developed even further.”Dons boss McInnes aims to strengthen his squad further before the Europa League second qualifying round first leg clash with Burnley on Thursday July 26.Doncaster’s stance is that Marquis is not for sale as he is the club’s leading scorer with40 goals in two seasons.He has two years left on his contract and sources indicate it would take a bid of close to £1m to test Doncaster’s resolve.That is likely to be far too rich for Aberdeen.McInnes has already introduced three new signings for the new campaign with Forrester, Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson and teenage midfielder Lewis Ferguson.A training compensation fee has yet to be agreed between Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton.The Reds have offered in excess of £100,000 while Accies are understood to value the 18-year-old at around £900,000.The matter is set to go to an SPFL tribunal with a date still to be set.Aberdeen are confident the final figure will be close to their valuation.McInnes is also in the hunt for defensive cover before the start of the season that kicks off with the Euro clash with Burnley.Aberdeen then face Rangers in a Premiership opener on August 5 that will mark the domestic debut of new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard.Milne said: “We know it is going to be a very challenging league this year.“Rangers are upping their game, Hearts have brought in a lot of new players and I have no doubt once Hibs get going there will be plenty of new players coming in there.“I do think it will be a very competitive league.“We have never had a period since Fergie left where we have effectively delivered so many second-placed finishes.“That is how close we have been for the last five years which is great testament to Derek and his backroom team and the players.“We still have the core of the players that will be part of that this coming season.“It is going to be a big challenge.”With such a competitive Premiership expected will there be recognition of that in McInnes’ budget?“Very much so,” said Milne. “Since Derek joined the club it has been part of growing the budget every year.“We have done various things over the years to help us generate additional cash.“Last year we got the Granite Club operating and this year we have the DNA membership scheme up and running.“The bulk of that additional cash we are trying to feed into the football budget.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen for all","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor defender Andy Considine the Dons are a team for the working class and every supporter, regardless of financial situation, should be able to see them in action.Although it’s the Oil Capital of Europe, the 30-year-old acknowledges there are many within the Granite City who are struggling with poverty.The economic downturn has hit the city hard and for some watching the Dons at Pittodrie is not a possibility.Which is why Considine is fully behind the club’s innovative Aberdeen for All scheme, which provides the use of season tickets to the most deserving in the community.Working alongside parent charity Aberdeen FC Community Trust, the Dons will identify families and individuals who will benefit most from the initiative.More than 500 season tickets were issued through Aberdeen for All last season and that is set to rise in the upcoming campaign following the donation of sponsors.Considine, who is set to face St Johnstone in a friendly in Perth tomorrow, said: “Aberdeen is a working-class city and football is a working-class game.“It has always been that way.Regardless of your situation you should be able to come and watch football.“This is a fantastic gesture from everyone involved.“Aberdeen has the oil but that has taken a huge hit over the last couple of years.“This can make a difference for many kids as it offers them the chance to come to a game on a Saturday.”Following Aberdeen’s 2-1 European Cup Winners’ Cup final win over Real Madrid in 1983, Bernabeu legend Alfredo Di Stefano, then Real manager, said “Aberdeen have what money can’t buy – a soul, a team spirit built in a family tradition.”For Considine that philosophy remains at the heart of the club which is why social inclusion for all is so fundamental to the Reds.A product of the Pittodrie youth system, he said: “Aberdeen have always had that family tradition.“This keeps everyone even closer as a community.“To see the smiles on young kids’ faces when they come to watch the football and watch potentially their idols, it is priceless.“It is a great experience for them and it might spur some of them on to become footballers like ourselves.“For a club like Aberdeen that relies on young people coming through the youth system to break into the first team, regardless of whether you have a bit of money or not, you should still be able to have that chance. You should still be able to have that opportunity to make it in football or any sport regardless of your situation.“This type of scheme is potentially getting people on that right track.”Following sponsorship from Aberdeen-based companies, the Dons will be able to reach more deserving families and local community groups via the scheme. The companies are Swire Oilfield Services, Burness \u0026amp Paull, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Simmons \u0026amp Co International.The initiative is also supported by Stewart Milne Group and the Cormack Foundations.Aberdeen FC Community Trust (AFCCT) already work with many charities and organisations throughout the city to provide support and opportunities.Considine believes there is a social responsibility for the Reds above and beyond what they do on the pitch.Asked if this expanded as far as donating to food banks he said: “There is one out at Banchory my wife and I have donated at a couple of times. I am sure there are plenty of others who have as well at Aberdeen.“People should be supporting these things.”Aberdeen For All is aimed at individuals in the local community who are in need due to a number of reasons such as social exclusion, financial hardship or other disadvantages.Ally Prockter, chief executive of AFC Community Trust said: “AFCCT is delighted to be working closely with Aberdeen FC in relation to their Aberdeen For All initiative.“Social inclusion is a serious challenge which can be overcome in many ways, and for many people it is important they feel as if they are part of something bigger.“Providing AFC match tickets to those who otherwise cannot attend home games is an important step towards making people feel included in our local community.“We work closely with the club and its sponsors to identify individuals and organisations who can benefit from becoming part of the Aberdeen FC family.’Barry Douglas, Seaton Community Church pastor, is delighted to see a scheme supporting those most in need in the local community.Douglas said: “The people this scheme is helping out are from under-privileged backgrounds and who would not normally have access to football.“You really get to see the joy being brought out in them when they receive their tickets.“The tickets I have distributed so far have gone to families who will get a huge uplift from them.“There are more out there who could benefit from this scheme, so I hope it’s a great success.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"offers over 390000 aberdeen home in top location","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen Joannie Fowlie first stepped over the door of her fabulous granite double upper apartment in Rosemount, it was a case of déjà vu for the retired teacher.For she had visited the property some 30 plus years earlier, when son Russell, lived in “digs” there while studying at university."},{"url":null,"title":"jenny creates moving piece of artistic work","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen pupil\u0026#8217s artistic skills are set to be admired by hundreds of bus passengers after she scooped top prize in a competition.The entry by Jenny Lee, 11, was chosen from 200 other pupils at Kingswells Primary, who were tasked with creating a piece of art that showed the benefits of public transport.The contest was run by bus firm Stagecoach and the winning entry will be on display for passengers to see on the number 14 service between Aberdeen and Kingswells.Head teacher Moira McIver said: “All of the children did a fantastic job creating their entries for the competition and I look forward to seeing Jenny’s winning design on the buses.”Ian Bell, operations manager for Stagecoach North Scotland, added: “It was hard to narrow it down to just one winner.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful.

I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time. As we get a clearer picture of the condition of the building further restrictions may be necessary to keep rail users and the wider public safe. “We will continue to track the work carried out on the privately owned building with a view to recovering the costs of these works from the owners.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport"},{"url":null,"title":"win-300-in-our-pet-idol-2018-competition","story":"Calling all animal lovers...\nEntries are now open for this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition \u0026ndash and your chance to win \u0026pound300!\nAll you have to do is send us a photo of your pet - feathered, furry or finned.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

campaign","story":"The school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

welcome to this auspicious occasion, the opening of our new clubhouse.\u0026#8216We hope you agree with us that it’s a vast improvement on our previous clubhouse, built in the 1950s.\u0026#8216I would particularly like to welcome our special guest, Ailsa Stewart.\u0026#8216Mrs Stewart was asked to take over the running of the club 70 years ago in her present role as trustee.\u0026#8216Some have commented that this project has been all down to myself but that’s not true and I have a lot of people to thank.\u0026#8216Firstly, our committee, and this morning six of us set up for today.\u0026#8216Three members, Gill Wright, Jane Gallagher and Donald MacKay have been outstanding.\u0026#8216Gill designed the clubhouse and ramp and dealt with the planning regulations.\u0026#8216Jane, who unlike me, is very meticulous, reads the small print on our legal contracts with sportscotland and Tennis Scotland and advises us accordingly.\u0026#8216Gill and Jane

contractors for their amazing work in transforming our club into one fit for the 21st century.\u0026#8216I would like to single out our main contractor, Gerry Nugent. Nothing was ever a problem. He was very reassuring even when we discovered the old clubhouse had no solid foundations.\u0026#8216I first became involved in the club as a 12-year-old looking to escape the house and meet up with friends.\u0026#8216My friends and I spent many hours at the courts, sometimes playing tennis, often not.\u0026#8216Mrs Dickson or Gertie, as we used to call her, was in charge in those days. She gave up so much of her time making sure the club was thriving and that we were behaving.\u0026#8216She had no hesitation in throwing us out if this wasn’t the case and I’m delighted to see Gertie’s sons, Toby and Ronnie here today.\u0026#8216Since 2014 we have raised a total of £95,000 to resurface our two courts and build the new clubhouse and ramp.\u0026#8216In two years I’ll retire from the committee and as a coach.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.

Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7972409.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cement-plant-says-sorry-for-cars-being-coated-in-dust","story":"  Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

A spokesman for the Dunbar RNLI said: \u0026ldquoHe and his partner had been enjoying a barbecue on the beach.  \u0026ldquoWhen the barbecue cooled they moved it elsewhere but the man stood on sand where the disposable tray had been sitting.  \u0026ldquoThe heat of the sand was such his feet blistered.  \u0026ldquoCrew members used burn bags to protect the man\u0026rsquos feet as they, with help from two surfers, transferred him to the lifeboat.  \u0026ldquoThey then headed to the nearby chalets at Shore Road, where an ambulance crew was waiting to treat the man for his injuries.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

After almost 12 hours of thrashing out the pros and cons of her proposed customs plan during a Cabinet away-day in her country retreat at Chequers, Mrs May issued a dramatic statement.  She said: \u0026ldquoToday in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU.  \u0026ldquoOur proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area, which establishes a common rule-book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  She went on: \u0026ldquoWe have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.  \u0026ldquoNext week we will be publishing a White Paper, which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \u0026ldquoNow we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve, added Mrs May, who is expected to make a Commons statement on Monday to set out in detail to MPs her proposed way forward on Brexit.  Despite talk of possible resignations by the likes of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, none had materialised.  Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon suggested how the best outcome of the Chequers summit would have been the resignation of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohard Brexiteers as this might have signalled a \u0026ldquoglimmer of hope that common sense starts to prevail.  The First Minister warned the worst outcome would be if Mrs May\u0026rsquos colleagues emerged \u0026ldquoarm in arm, saying they\u0027ve agreed, because that means there\u0027s another helping of fudge being served up.  She added if the outcome of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos marathon session was simply an agreement that satisfied the apparently irreconcilable wings of the Tory government, then the \u0026ldquodanger is\u0026hellipthat it will be dead on arrival in Brussels and we will be no further forward in reaching agreement\" with the EU27.  Over a dinner of whiskey and treacle-cured Scottish salmon, Mrs May and her senior colleagues put the finishing touches to their Cabinet deal, which some colleagues and pundits believed impossible. Talk among Brexiteers beforehand had claimed that the PM\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement \u0026ndash a hybrid of the two previous options \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquonot full Brexit and that regulatory alignment with the EU on goods would prevent the UK from striking its own future trade deals.  However, perhaps in a key sign of the agreement to come, Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, broke off from a meeting of Brexiteers on Thursday night, organised by Mr Johnson at the Foreign Office, to have private talks with the PM, who sought to reassure him that under her compromise plan future trade deals would be possible. He emerged \u0026ldquocontent with her plan.  Key now will be how Brussels reacts. Earlier, Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, said that he was ready to adapt the EU27\u0027s stance in response to any changes to the UK\u0027s \"red lines\".  Meanwhile, it emerged at a meeting at London\u0026rsquos Carlton Club on Thursday night, David Cameron persuaded Mr Johnson not to resign, saying Mrs May\u0026rsquos third-way customs plan was the only one the Commons would accept.  While the PM was thrashing out her plan with colleagues at Chequers, her predecessor was watching thrashing of a sporting kind.  Mr Cameron was looking tanned and relaxed in a smart suit and sunglasses in the Royal Box at Wimbledon alongside his mother Mary and a previous Foreign Secretary, Lord Hague."},{"url":null,"title":"space-school-where-nasa-inspires-scottish-school-kids","story":"  Williams is part of a crack NASA team, which also includes space surgeon, Rick Scheuring, that is inspiring young Scots to reach for the skies. They teach at Scottish Space School, a summer programme run each year by the University of Strathclyde, which encourages S5 school students to consider a career in the space industry or engineering  For young Scots, space might not seem an obvious career avenue, but Scotland\u0026rsquos burgeoning space industry is now worth \u0026pound2.5 billion a year and growing. There is also a political drive to get more young people into Science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM). Scottish Space School is also not just about making young people think about space \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos about showing them the possibilities of a career in STEM.  As Marianne Ballantyne, who runs the school out of the Faculty of Engineering at University of Strathclyde, notes, \u0026ldquoWe use space as the hook to encourage applications into engineering and STEM, because there is nothing like that at all. The NASA people that come over here all have a stem background, so they\u0026rsquore all scientists or engineers or in the STEM areas.  The space school, however, doesn\u0026rsquot just bring NASA to Scotland \u0026ndash it takes ten of its star students out to Houston for an all access tour of NASA, a night hanging out at astronauts\u0026rsquo homes for a pool party and other space-related activities. This year 547 pupils across Scotland applied for the 100 places at space school. Ten of those were selected for the highly prized trip to Houston.  Among them was Evie Clark. The 16-year-old has long had an interest in space and had already considered doing engineering before she attended space school. However, she notes that when she was younger she didn\u0026rsquot see it as something for her. \u0026ldquoI had the mindset that, as a girl, I couldn\u0026rsquot do that because that\u0026rsquos about boys who become mechanics. I thought it was about cars and getting your hands dirty. But my uncle\u0026rsquos an engineer and I went for a day at my uncle\u0026rsquos work. One of the women said who here thinks engineering is just for boys? Loads of the girls put their hands up. She said, \u0026lsquoNo it\u0026rsquos not.\u0026rsquo  The ambition of working in the space industry may seem a far-fetched one for young people living in Scotland, but Scottish Space School makes it seem realisable. As Clark puts it, \u0026ldquoI always thought working with space would be a dream, but not one that would ever realistically happen. I thought that\u0026rsquos not going to happen. People from Scotland don\u0026rsquot work in the space industry. But just going and seeing so many people doing jobs that you would dream about and talking to them was such a motivator that it\u0026rsquos spurred me on to think this is what I\u0026rsquom going to do. I will make it happen.  Space school also isn\u0026rsquot just about the Houston trip \u0026ndash which takes place in October this year. The week in itself is a challenging and rewarding experience for the young people. They get to build a rocket and launch it in Bellahouston park, design a product to enhance life in space, and be inspired by the NASA team. Also, on this year\u0026rsquos programme was Lewis Jones, a 17-year-old from Trinity High School in Rutherglen, who recalls that one of the most thrilling moments for him was when he got to press the button and launch the rocket.  Jones had always been interested in planes, right from when he was a small child, and on family holidays he would sit at the airport watching them take off and land, marvelling at how they stayed up in the air. \u0026ldquoMy family are proud that I\u0026rsquom going to Houston, he says. \u0026ldquoWhen I told them, they were jumping up and down. They couldn\u0026rsquot believe it because, assuming I go, I would be the first person in my family to go to university. My dad works in construction, my mum in a chip shop. The main people that inspired me were the teachers.  NASA space surgeon Rick Scheuring views his role, in space school, as partly about helping young people who might never think they have a chance in the space industry to consider it. \u0026ldquoI remember, he recalls. \u0026ldquoI was at a NASA event ten years ago and a young inner city kid in Houston, came up to the podium and told the panel that for a kid who doesn\u0026rsquot come from a great socioeconomic background and didn\u0026rsquot do well at school, NASA is unapproachable. Spaceflight is not something that a kid like him could even dream of being part of. But the thing I tell kids is, \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom that kid. I didn\u0026rsquot have great grades when I was growing up. My parents didn\u0026rsquot have a lot of money. I went to average state schools. But tenacity and perseverance really paid off.\u0026rsquo  Both Scheuring and Williams also provide stories of how it\u0026rsquos possible to get to that dream job via a indirect route. Scheuring worked as a \u0026ldquosmalltown private practice doctor in Illinois for many years, but always with it in his mind that he might like to combine medicine with his love of space. Williams originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but didn\u0026rsquot get into the university she hoped to, ended up I the navy, worked as a test pilot, and found a possible path from there to space. She would go on to hold the record, which has since been broken, for most space walks done by a woman.  Scheuring observes that he is often struck by the enthusiasm for space when he works with children in countries which, like Scotland, don\u0026rsquot have a space programme. \u0026ldquoI talk to-12-year old kids in Taiwan who are crazy about space, and I wonder what it is that is inspiring them. Then. I think back to my own story and think, \u0026lsquoYeah, we had a space programme in the 1960s and 1970s but it was just the wonder of space and being a part of something much bigger than yourself.\u0026rsquo Kids hook onto that stuff, and they want that.  Many of the Scottish Space School alumni have gone on to study engineering. One is already working in the Scottish space industry at Clyde Space. Marnie McKay, a student currently doing an MA in electrical mechanical engineering at the University of Strathclyde, recalls how Scottish Space School made her rethink her career plans. She had been \u0026ldquobent on becoming a lawyer, but then, she says, the programme \u0026ldquocompletely turned my head.  A reason, she believes, she hadn\u0026rsquot thought about engineering in the first place is the stereotypes that exist around it. \u0026ldquoI had completely the wrong idea of what engineering is. My parents discouraged me too, because they think of boys that play with Lego and computers in their free time are more suited, and I did theatre and singing and dancing.  Her special interest is power engineering, and she is currently looking at working in the renewables industry. Space, though, is still on her mind. \u0026ldquoI went into power engineering because it\u0026rsquos still space related. Although I ended up working in the power sector I wouldn\u0026rsquot rule out working in the space industry in the future.  On her visit to Houston, she recalls, that one of the things that struck her most was how down to earth and accessible the people she met at NASA were. \u0026ldquoI realised that they were people like me and that if I applied my passion as well I could probably make the same sort of difference. That\u0026rsquos what inspired me - that they were normal people not superhuman.  A path to space \u0026ndash Sunita Williams  Sunita Williams  \u0026ldquoThis was not my plan, to be an astronaut. I tell the students at Scottish Space School, that when you\u0026rsquore young you don\u0026rsquot have to have a plan. You can just have an idea of things that you\u0026rsquore interested in, and don\u0026rsquot be totally disappointed if things change along the way. I was very fortunate to have, when I was a kid, what I would call potential failures. I didn\u0026rsquot get the first thing that I wanted to get. I didn\u0026rsquot get into the university that I thought I needed to go to in order to become a veterinarian. But it opened another door and I got into the navy and this gave me the opportunity to learn how to fly and that gave me an opportunity to become a test pilot, which was what got me on my way to thinking about applying to be an astronaut.  One of the things that left the biggest impression on me was my first spacewalk. You\u0026rsquore just going outside the space station for the first time and you\u0026rsquore trying not to be nervous but you\u0026rsquore a little nervous. Then, when I finally got out of the door and put a tether on, all of a sudden, the sun came up. It was mind blowing. A little later, we flew over Canada and the northern lights were below us. It was amazing to be above them. I\u0026rsquod seen them from below but never from above. Being up there really puts things in perspective. Our planet is awesome. We think everything that is going on here is so important and then you realise there is so much energy in the universe and things going on we have no control of.  In NASA, of course there are more men than women. I was in the military and that was a little bit more, in my mind, male oriented than NASA was. The stem fields were not very populated on the American side then women. But it\u0026rsquos improving more and more. But the class of 2013 was four men and four women. They were the most qualified. That\u0026rsquos happening.  What I do with Scottish Space School is really about encouraging the next generation to explore. There is so much we have to learn about. What we do in space is also about helping people solve problems on earth. It makes people think outside of the box. You design something to use in space and you have to think about things differently. And not only are you using those creative juices to design something that works in space you\u0026rsquore also using them to find ways to do things here."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-says-game-on-after-tory-cabinet-agrees-soft-brexit-plan","story":"  After a day of intensive discussions at the Prime Minister\u0027s country seat, Chequers, on Friday Theresa May managed to secure the agreement of her top ministerial team to proposals setting out the country\u0027s future relationship with the European Union.  The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \"common rulebook\".  \"It\u0027s a Trojan Horse deal,\" is how rising SNP star Christopher McEleny described it, predicting that the EU would reject the proposal. \"This is fantasy politics,\" added McEleny, who is also the leader of the party group on Inverclyde Council. \"Every single one of the 27 EU members has to agree it and the plain truth is that they won\u0027t.\"  His comments seemed to be at odds with Sturgeon\u0027s, who described the plan as having \"more realism in it than we\u0027ve seen before from UK government\", although she added \"that\u0027s not saying much\".  Hardline eurosceptic MPs have begun to voice concerns over May\u0026rsquos plans to negotiate a soft Brexit deal. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see \"have the red lines been turned pink\", as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: \"As with eggs. An egg that is very softly boiled isn\u0027t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven\u0027t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.\" A comment underlined by fellow Tory Andrea Jenkyns MP.  The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage described it as a sell out. \u0026ldquoTheresa May has betrayed us all \u0026ndash and Brexiteer ministers are letting her get away with it, he said.  However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas, \"providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market, withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland\u0027s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.\"  She also hit out at the SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had \"used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart\".  Downing Street is now engaged in desperate efforts to win over Tory Eurosceptics after May\u0027s Brexit compromise plan which keeping the UK closely tied to Brussels was agreed by her Cabinet.  The Prime Minister\u0027s inner circle is now desperately trying to secure support from the party\u0027s eurosceptics for the proposals to create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods.  Cabinet Brexiteers may have already been persuaded to support the plans after a marathon session of talks at Chequers, but backbench eurosceptics continue to express grave doubts.  The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK\u0027s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize. The cabinet Brexiter Chris Grayling acknowledged the proposal could lead to issues in negotiating a US trade deal.  Full details will be published in a white paper on Thursday, with Brussels expecting a round of negotiations in the week following.  The SNP\u0027s McEleny predicted that May\u0027s team would blame a failure of negotiations on the EU and that the final outcome would be a hard Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"how-to-keep-your-cool-this-blistering-summer","story":"  But you don\u0026rsquot need to be supporting a cause, of course, to want to make a splash and Scotland has some of the world\u0026rsquos most beautiful swimming spots.  Aberdour Silver Sands in Fife is shallow for a long stretch, making it a good introduction to outdoor swimming for all ages and abilities. Another plus is the proximity to the village itself, where besides places to refuel there\u0026rsquos Aberdour Castle, one of the oldest stone castles in Scotland, and the medieval St Fillan\u0026rsquos Church. Both are well worth a visit.  Loch Ken in Dumfries and Galloway is regularly fed by water from the nearby hydro-electric scheme so it is cleaner than most. Like Aberdour, it is suitable for all the family and Galloway Activity Centre could be a base for convenience and access to a waterfront cafe.

A few lengths from the central belt, Milarrochy Bay just north of Balmaha on Loch Lomond is suitable for swimmers out for a paddle or those in training for something more strenuous, and there are food and drink options in both Balmaha and nearby Drymen.  A little further afield, Calgary Bay in Mull is sheltered with everything you could ask for: soft sand, crystal-clear water and, if you\u0026rsquore lucky, the sight of an eagle. Loch Ard, near Aberfoyle, offers a wealth of watersports \u0026hellip swimming being just one of them.  Safety, particularly in Scotland where deep water temperatures can sit stubbornly close to freezing at any time of year, is key. Police Scotland has issued a warning following a number of incidents in the heatwave.  Superintendent Carol McGuire, who leads on specialist operations which includes the Dive and Marine Unit, warns: \u0026ldquoOpen water can be extremely cold and can cause your body to cramp, some people even go into shock. Very cold water can also have an impact on your ability to swim. We would urge people to take note of the signage in areas which clearly states that you should not enter the water. These signs are there for your safety, so please, don\u0026rsquot think that you know better.\u0026ldquo On beaches, it is advisable to keep an eye out for tides and currents. Be prepared for underwater obstacles and alcohol should be a no-no. A brightly-coloured cap will help others see you if the water is busy or you get into bother. Wear a wetsuit \u0026ndash it will allow you a few extra minutes in the water before a quick change for a hot cup of tea.

The bottle had previously been sold for \u0026pound4,200 in 2014, an annual increase in value of 280 per cent.  Earlier this year a special-edition bottle of The Macallan, with a label designed by pop artist Peter Blake, was sold for \u0026pound1.1m at an auction in Hong Kong.  Sean McGlone, Whisky Auctioneer director, said a growing number of people from across the world, especially from the Far East, were starting to collect whisky as an investment. He claimed that while new producers from countries such as Japan were increasingly able to attract big mark-ups, it was still the Scotch and Scottish whiskies that are fetching the record-breaking prices.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos been a huge increase in the number of people drinking and enjoying whisky and also in investing in whisky, not just in the UK and Europe but all around the world. It\u0026rsquos a booming international business.  \u0026ldquoScottish whiskies are now reaching their highest prices ever. They are doing fantastically well and breaking all sorts of records left, right and centre. It\u0026rsquos not looking like slowing down either. The Scottish whisky industry is on the up and up. That\u0026rsquos not to detract from the other producers of whisky, such as Japan, whose whiskies are also doing well as auction. But I\u0026rsquod say they are the only other country who could hold a candle to Scotland.  But he claimed that Brexit would be \u0026ldquoa nightmare for the business, especially if no trade deal can be reached, with export duties and regulations making it almost impossible to trade in the UK, and potentially meaning relocation to Europe.  \u0026ldquoWe trade in a global market with many collectors in the States or the Far East, he added. \u0026ldquoAnything that stops free trade is therefore really bad for the collectable whisky market.  Blair Bowman, whisky consultant and author, who has also turned broker in the last six months, agreed there was now a demand for whisky that was even driving up prices of standard, good quality bottles as producers realised that there was money to be made.  He is now selling single casks to a select client base from around the world including those in the Far East and the States. But he said it was essential that people understood the whisky market if they wanted to really make money.  \u0026ldquoThe brands that always do well are things like Ardbeg, The Macallan and Bowmore, but unless it\u0026rsquos a very rare edition you have to be prepared to keep those for a very long time if they are going to be worth anything, he added.  He said it was important that people didn\u0026rsquot forget about the special nature of the drink \u0026ndash made from a trinity of grain, water and time \u0026ndash in their haste to make money. With two previously crashes in the whisky market, one at the turn of the 20th century due to the temperance movement and one in the eighties due to over-production, experts have warned potential investors should buy bottles they would be happy to drink as well as sell.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos great that more people are taking an interest, and it\u0026rsquos great for the status of whisky, added Bowman. \u0026ldquoBut I think it\u0026rsquos sad if you end up with a market of investors who never open a bottle. I know of one Chinese investor who doesn\u0026rsquot drink alcohol for example. Whisky is meant to be shared \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos about shared moments and experiences.  Andy Simpson, co-founder of whisky investment company Rare Whisky 101, said: \u0026ldquoWith more buyers than ever in the market for the best whiskies, the value of highly-regarded single malts is increasing at a rapid rate, with prices being dictated by this consumer demand. Investors, collectors and connoisseurs are becoming increasingly aware of whisky\u0026rsquos rapidly growing popularity around the world, particularly for the rarest and most coveted single malts."},{"url":null,"title":"fiona-hyslop-our-links-with-japan-and-south-korea-have-gone-from-strength-to-strength","story":"  As Brexit uncertainty continues to impact on business confidence \u0026ndash and as we face the threat of losing membership of the Single Market and Custom Union \u0026ndash it is increasingly important that we continue to engage with international partners and build trade and business links.  As highlighted by a recent EY Attractiveness Survey, Scotland is one of the most alluring locations for foreign direct investment outside of London. Scottish Government visits such as this are therefore critical to promote our unique assets to international audiences.  This is why during this visit I met with key business representatives across a range of sectors including renewables, subsea engineering and life sciences \u0026ndash from Mitsubishi Electric to the Nippon Foundation \u0026ndash to acknowledge the significant contribution these businesses make to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and to reiterate the message that Scotland is an excellent partner to do business with.  The ties between Scotland and Japan date back 150 years to a time when Scots engineers helped the Pacific nation kick-start its own industrial revolution. The links between our countries have since gone from strength to strength \u0026ndash so that, to date, 90 Japanese-owned businesses at 135 Scottish sites employ over 6,000 staff, generating a Scottish turnover of more than \u0026pound1.8 billion.  In 2016, exports to Japan increased by more than 10 per cent to \u0026pound460m, making Japan the 19th top destination for Scottish exports. With foreign direct investment into Scotland from Japan accounting for almost six per cent of all inward investment over the past decade, I believe there is scope for even closer collaboration \u0026ndash to seize shared opportunities and meet common challenges as both our countries look to address the growing needs of the global market.  Following the launch of our Scotland is Now campaign, this visit was an opportunity to further promote Scotland as a top destination to visit, live, work, invest and study. I held tourism events in both Tokyo and Seoul. I also signed a joint declaration of co-operation between Scotland and Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan and host to two of Scotland\u0026rsquos Rugby World Cup games in 2019.  Building on the constructive meeting I held with Yokohama\u0027s mayor during my last visit, this declaration is an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and expertise, while strengthening existing ties in the areas of education, sports, culture and marine industries as Japan builds to the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the Olympics and Paralympics in 2020.  In addition, I met with local representatives and culture stakeholders to share best practices and discuss how culture in Scotland plays a vital role in shaping our cultural identity, strengthening business links and promoting our country internationally.  While in Tokyo I met with representatives from Japan\u0026rsquos Ricca Ricca Festival, the annual international festival of performing arts for young people held in Okinawa. This year, the festival will focus on Scotland as a result of a joint funding initiative between Ricca Ricca, Creative Scotland, Scottish Government and British Council Scotland. As we celebrate Scotland\u0026rsquos Year of Young People 2018, this represents a great opportunity for Scotland\u0026rsquos world leading children\u0026rsquos theatre to showcase their talent to international audiences beyond our borders.  I also met with Japanese city leaders in Tokyo to discuss how Scotland\u0026rsquos arts community can help Japan shape its cultural programme for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Japanese prefectures are now looking to deliver a world-class programme of cultural activity as part of the Olympics and are looking to Scotland for inspiration. It was a pleasure to discuss Scotland\u0026rsquos use of culture as a promotional tool in domestic and international markets while we get ready to welcome our Japanese partners to Scotland this August during Edinburgh\u0026rsquos peak festival season.  I was delighted to witness the signing of an important agreement between Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, a major Japanese industrial corporation, and the Underwater Centre near Fort William. It will see the world\u0026rsquos first test of an autonomous underwater vehicle take place in Scotland. Kawasaki will carry out a verification test of a prototype AUV equipped with a robot arm for subsea pipeline inspection.  This visit also represented an opportunity to promote our world-leading universities and to announce that the Scottish Government flagship Saltire Scholarship programme will open to Japanese postgraduates. Currently available to students from Canada, China, Pakistan and the US, the fund offers 50 scholarships worth \u0026pound8,000 per year, co-funded by the Scottish Government and partner universities.  In South Korea, I met with key tourism leaders and travel media, an ideal opportunity to further promote business and travel contacts between our two countries. I also met companies that are keen to build on their trade and investment in Scotland.  In 2017, Scotland exported 744 million of goods to South Korea, a 165 per cent increase on the previous year. Korean company Doosan Babcock is a key investor in Scotland, employing approximately 1,200 people across eight different sites,with the main facility in Renfrew.  At government level, I focussed on developing links on rural development and cultural issues.  Scotland has strengths and qualities that make it a unique location for international cooperation and investment. My message to our friends in Japan and the Republic of Korea is that, whatever your reason for coming to Scotland, you will be offered the warmest of welcomes here and will find a bold and positive country shaping a progressive, pioneering and inclusive future."},{"url":null,"title":"sprinklers-not-installed-at-burrell-museum-as-66m-upgrade-continues","story":"  The contractors hired to renovate the Burrell are Kier Construction, the same company which was undertaking work on the ill-fated Glasgow School of Art, which was destroyed by fire last month.  When Kier was awarded the contract managing director of the company in Scotland, Brian McQuade, said, \"We have a solid record of working on major heritage projects of this scale, including the restoration of the Mackintosh Building at the Galsgow School of Art and the refurbishment of Edinburgh College of Art and Aberdeen Music Hall.\"  It emerged after the fire which ravaged the Mackintosh building that while sprinklers had been installed they were not operational.  The Burrell, which displayed a portion of the artworks collected in the 19th century by Glasgow shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, is due to reopen in 2020. It is understood that the majority of the 9,000 artworks have been removed from the building in Pollok Park as it is cleared for Kier to begin work later this month.  A Kier spokesperson referred all questions to the client, Glasgow Life, a charity set up by the city council to deliver cultural, sporting and educational activities. Glasgow City Council has pledged \u0026pound27m towards the upgrade and virtually all of the budget has been raised.  A spokesman for Glasgow Life, confirming that no sprinklers are presently installed, said: \u0026ldquoThere is currently full-time security at the building.

I am, of course, referring to the morning after fire tore through .  For those of us who had been following events the night before on our social media feeds, we had seen videos and pictures of the huge blaze that destroyed Mackintosh\u0026rsquos historic Glasgow School of Art. Screeds of messages appeared on our screens in a collective outpouring of grief.  But it wasn\u0026rsquot until the morning after, when walking to work, I realised the impact on the city. The atmosphere at 8am on Sauchiehall Street was heavy with grief a sombre stillness, akin, in gravity, to the weighted hush after the Brexit vote.  Police officers quietly ushered early-morning tourists away from taped-off streets. Small crowds began to congregate on street corners. Some took photos of the derelict scenes before them and others merely stood in respectful remorse, heads shaking in numb disbelief.  High above the rooftops, a plume of black smoke trailed into the air like a funeral pyre.  It is easy, at first glance, to appreciate the devastating loss the blaze that ravaged through the art school incurred the brutal removal of an important Glasgow institution and the irreversible damage to years\u0026rsquo worth of renovation efforts since fire first struck in 2014. However, it was the reactions of those around me of dumbstruck passers-by and the eulogies of bereft alumni alike, that stuck me most.  I began to wonder, what was it about these iconic buildings, that made us care so deeply about them?  In addition to its capacity as a Glasgow landmark and university facility, the school of art was more than just a building.  It served, for many, as the background to the foremost years of their adult lives a place where individuality and expression was encouraged, and unique characters formed. Art school alumnus of architecture, Matt McCallum, who graduated on the day of the fire, shared his sadness of the loss of his university building, saying: \u0026ldquoThe importance of many of our historic buildings is based in more than just aesthetic. If the Mack is to be rebuilt anywhere but Garnethill, and as anything but a functioning art school, the magic is lost.  \u0026ldquoThe merit in this building is not only its craftwork or acute detailing but, in its ability, to inspire, provide, and nurture.  When we consider the history of the Glasgow School of Art, many know the bare bones of the profile of its creator, Charles Rennie Mackintosh \u0026ndash the talented Glasgow-born Art Nouveau architect and designer whose avant-garde work reshaped the design world of the early 1900s. Less is known about the artist\u0026rsquos personal life with his present-day fame eclipsing a turbulent past marred with an unstable career, coupled with countless rejections and reports of a suspected drinking problem.  Mackintosh\u0026rsquos work was largely unappreciated during his lifetime, and he died in poverty in 1928, unaware of the legacy he would leave behind. Speaking on Mackintosh\u0026rsquos influence, Glasgow writer and editor of Honest Error (2017), an anthology of poetry inspired by the artist\u0026rsquos work, Gillean McDougall reflects: \u0026ldquoI saw the broken Art School after the first fire in 2014 water flooding like tears down Scott Street, Glasgow people gathering in palpable, silent shock. \u0026ldquoThe 22 poets who subsequently contributed to my Honest Error anthology dug deep into the background of Mackintosh\u0026rsquos work, his and Margaret\u0026rsquos (his wife\u0026rsquos) experience, and a creative life which blossomed then withered to changing public taste.  \u0026ldquoTheir story \u0026ndash its poignancy, wit and ultimate genius \u0026ndash will continue to inspire generations, nothing can ever destroy that.  Heralded as his greatest masterpiece, the Mackintosh building epitomises the tireless efforts of an artist whose work was a labour of love in its most organic form, in spite of his many critics.  It represents the unique beauty and charm of the very best of Glasgow, a city whose tempestuous history could be said to reflect that of Mackintosh himself. We could spend hours lamenting the economic and cultural loss that the Mackintosh fire has brought to Glasgow but it\u0026rsquos behind the bricks and mortar where we see just why the building\u0026rsquos destruction has broken hearts of people across the world. A home and sanctuary to generations of artists through the years, the Glasgow School of Art will exist indefinitely in the memories of its students, staff and the Glasgow community, not only as a world-renowned school of art, but as a symbol for hope, individuality, and the legacy of one man\u0026rsquos attempt to make his mark on a world that didn\u0026rsquot fully understand him."},{"url":null,"title":"england-sink-sweden-to-reach-semi-finals-at-world-cup-how-the-papers-reacted","story":"  \u0026ldquoPrince Harry! declares the Mail on Sunday Sport after Harry Maguire headed home his first international goal to kick off the scoring in England\u0026rsquos 2-0 victory over Sweden.

But backbench Tory Brexiteers hit out at the plans, with speculation at Westminster that some could be prepared to submit formal letters calling for a leadership contest.  Meanwhile, it emerged that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson backed the proposals at Chequers despite claiming that defending the plans was like \u0026ldquopolishing a turd.  Despite his reservations, Mr Johnson fell into line along with the rest of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos Brexit-backing ministers.  Tory MP Andrew Bridgen compared the Foreign Secretary to Neville Chamberlain, accusing him of \u0026ldquowaving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels, along with other Brexiteer ministers.  Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that in a draft leadership letter circulating in Westminster, rebel Tories accuse the Prime Minister of letting the negotiations with Brussels descend \u0026ldquointo a state of complete capitulation.  It claims the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit promises appeared to be \u0026ldquoa pretence and a charade intended to dupe the electorate and concludes that \u0026ldquoin the interests of our country and the future of the Conservative Party, I feel the time has come for a new leader.  Mr Bridgen, writing in the Mail on Sunday, said Jacob Rees-Mogg \u0026ndash leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group \u0026ndash was now the only credible challenger to Mrs May after the failure by Cabinet ministers to oppose the Chequers plan.  In a message to the Cabinet, he said: \u0026ldquoAll those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm.  \u0026ldquoGrassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery.  \u0026ldquoSome will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down.  \u0026ldquoBut it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.  But Mrs May told the Sunday Times:\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquoThe only challenge that needs to be made now is to the European Union to get serious about this, to come round the table and discuss it with us.  The Prime Minister will address Tory MPs on Monday and her chief of staff Gavin Barwell has been engaged in efforts to explain the Chequers deal to concerned colleagues alongside Chief Whip Julian Smith.  Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told the Sunday  the Chequers plan appeared to amount to \u0026ldquocontinued membership of the customs union and single market for goods despite the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos promise to leave both.  \u0026ldquoIf the public perceive that not to be delivered then the Government, I\u0026rsquom afraid, will suffer the consequences at the next election, he said.

Now, three weeks later, the two sides were still at odds on all issues, including exactly what denuclearisation means and how it might be verified, after a third visit to Pyongyang by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Mr Pompeo wrapped up two days of talks in the North Korean capital on Saturday on an optimistic note even without meeting Kim Jong Un, as he had on his previous two trips.  He said his discussions had been productive and conducted in good faith, but he allowed that much more work needed to be done.  He and other US officials said the two countries, still technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War, had set up working groups to deal with details of an agreement.

In a statement carried by the North\u0026rsquos official Korean Central News Agency, the foreign ministry said the outcome of Mr Pompeo\u0026rsquos talks with senior official Kim Yong Chol was \u0026ldquovery concerning because it has led to a \u0026ldquodangerous phase that might rattle our willingness for denuclearisation that had been firm.  \u0026ldquoWe had expected that the US side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders\u0026rsquo summit \u0026hellip we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures, it said.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the attitude and stance the United States showed in the first high-level meeting (between the countries) was no doubt regrettable.

A former top US diplomat for Asia, Daniel Russel, said the setback was to be expected and warned Mr Trump he is engaged in a long negotiation that would not produce easy quick, made for television results that the president likely wants.  \u0026ldquoDealing with North Korea is hard because Kim Jong Un wants it to be hard, said Mr Russel, who was assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Obama administration.  \u0026ldquoIf you make the Americans fight for every inch, the Americans will start measuring progress in inches \u0026mdash and will wind up paying by the inch. At this point, even to get the North Koreans to follow through with the return of Korean War-era MIA remains, would feel like a big win for Pompeo, even though it wouldn\u0026rsquot affect the nuclear threat.  \u0026ldquoKim can afford to play hardball because it\u0026rsquos clear to him that Trump, who has already told Americans they can sleep soundly because the threat is now over, badly wants a deal, Mr Russel said. \u0026ldquoAnd when you want it bad, you get it bad.

There will be a massive discussion about all this.\"  Sir Bill said he had not written a letter calling for a leadership contest but \"if people were to decide to put in those letters you only need 48 and as a matter of fact nobody can stop them, once the decision has been taken by those people the chairman of the 1922 Committee has to implement the process.\"  Meanwhile, the Labour leadership branded the Chequers deal \"unworkable\" and a \"fudge\" and challenged the PM to put it to a Commons vote.  Sir Keir Starmer described Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise as a \"bureaucratic nightmare\".  He told the Marr Show: \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s got fudge written all over it.  \"If you look at the facilitated customs arrangement, the sort of heart of this, it\u0027s a rebadging of the partnership and it\u0027s based on the idea that at the border you can distinguish between goods that are going to stay in the UK and those going to the EU.  \"It\u0027s unworkable, it\u0027s a bureaucratic nightmare, so this a fudge,\" declared the Shadow Brexit Secretary.  The Labour frontbencher called for MPs to be given the chance to vote between Labour and the Government\u0027s customs plans.  \"We\u0027ve now got two propositions, we\u0027ve got the Labour proposition, which has the majority support in Parliament, and the Prime Minister\u0027s new proposition, let\u0027s put it to a vote. I challenge the Prime Minister: put it to a vote and see where the majority is in Parliament on a customs union,\" added Sir Keir.  His Labour colleague, Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, said he believed the transition period would have to be extended under the Chequers agreement.  Asked if more time would be needed to negotiate a deal with the EU, he replied: \"It\u0026rsquos definitely more likely the transitional period is going to have to be extended because the Government itself now admits that now with this latest version, this facilitated customs arrangement it isn\u0027t going to be ready by the end of the current proposed transition period which is December 2020.\"  He added that if the plans did not work out, then the Government should \"bite the bullet and say remaining in the customs union is much the simplest and easiest way of doing this\".  Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, said Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise was \"sensible\" and called on her colleagues to stop arguing.  \u0026ldquoMy sense is that we now really need to stick together as a party, get behind the Prime Minister and try and make sure that we support her as she goes through what are going to be monumentally difficult negotiations with the EU.\"  She added: \"The time for arguments within that Chequers team, within that Cabinet team, has now got to stop.\"  Elsewhere, Gerard Batten, the Ukip leader, said the Chequers deal was a \u0026ldquobetrayal of the referendum vote.  \"May has done everything she possibly can in the past two years to delay Brexit, to impede Brexit, and all in the intended outcome of reversing the referendum decision.  \"The Chequers agreement is the opposite of what Mrs May promised us two years ago, when she said the UK wouldn\u0027t be half-in and half-out of the EU.  \"With this agreement, we are more in than we are out and means the UK will have a similar status to those countries applying to join the EU.  \"The implications of that is obvious. It would seem to me that Mrs May hopes that by getting rid of the Ukip MEPs next March the party will disappear from the political scene.\"  But he added: \"This agreement betrays the referendum result and shows exactly why Ukip needs to become stronger than ever.\""},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-marr-and-sunday-brunch-hosts-wear-waistcoats-in-southgate-tribute","story":"  Southgate has worn the sleeveless suit staple throughout England\u0026rsquos World Cup campaign in Russia, giving the item a new lease of life.

But, appearing on the BBC\u0026rsquos Andrew Marr Show, Sir Keir left the door open to Labour backing a second EU vote.  He said: \u0026ldquoShould the Article 50 deal that the Prime Minister brings back be voted down or worse there\u0026rsquos no deal, then that\u0026rsquos a very serious situation and we\u0026rsquore going to have to confront it when we get there and that parliament must decide what happens next.  \u0026ldquoIn those circumstances, it seems to me the sensible thing is to keep all our options on the table.

We saw a higher number of lots and greater values of items sold, which is an increase from last year’s June sale.“Our reputation as Scotland’s largest collective plant, machinery and equipment sale, alongside the power of the auction system, can be attributed to the high prices at this sale, along with the weaker sterling currency and strong export demand.”                                                                                                        The next sale is scheduled to take place on Saturday, August 18 from 9am.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Sunday 8 Jul 2018 3:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

You might even be able to buy your own one!The pupils had been working on the concept of improving cycling safety since January and came up with the idea of covering a bike in Led lights.The bike was coded using a BBC micro:bit and buttons were wired up to have functions such as working indicators, brake lights \u0026ndash which turn the whole bike red \u0026ndash and a speedometer, as well as customisable colours.Pupils taking part in Apps for Good explore all aspects of product development, from the initial idea and programming to product design and marketing.Mr Aitken says he hopes to build on the success of the Light Bike by setting up an Inventors\u0026rsquo Club in Wick High and possibly a CoderDojo \u0026ndash part of a network of computer programming clubs \u0026ndash for primary children.This week\u0026rsquos category win was the latest in a series of Apps for Good achievements by teams from Wick High.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been incredibly lucky to have seen success now at the Apps for Good Awards for six years running \u0026ndash an unbeaten record, Mr Aitken said.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen our ideas evolve from the creation of wireframe prototypes to full-blown apps and we\u0026rsquore now pushing the boundaries further with the introduction of Internet of Things, physical computing, and very soon we\u0026rsquoll be starting machine learning / artificial intelligence with our pupils.\u0026ldquoAs always, I\u0026rsquom excited for what the future may bring for Wick High School pupils.Sunday 8 Jul 2018 3:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 8, 2018 at 1:20 pmExtensive searches are continuing in order to trace missing pensioner James Mainland, with a visible police presence in Birsay throughout today, Sunday.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is likely that a further consultation will take place once specific options have been drawn up, giving all stakeholders a further opportunity to provide us with their views.“This means that final decisions will be made next year, rather than in September as first envisaged. I would again assure all involved that to date, a decision has not been taken by the council to discontinue using the St Colm’s building.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765653.1530992976!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm laws governing eu referendum proved meaningless","story":"        Without a criminal sanction or  the threat of a re-run, Vote Leave can cock a snook at the Electoral Commission, says Euan McColm                Imagine you’re unhappy with your television. The screen’s too small, the sound’s terrible and, frankly, nobody much enjoyed watching that last match round at your place.            There’s only one thing for it: you’re going to have to shell out a couple of grand on a new one.            Unfortunately, you’ve already spent the last of your savings on lottery tickets and artisan gin so the need for a TV simply cannot be met with the \u2028resources you have available. So what do you do?You could do the right thing and save a bit, maybe buy a new flat-screen next year, or you could, I suppose, stroll confidently into John Lewis, unhook a fancy Sony from the wall and march out with it under your arm.And, if a security guard stopped you by the front door, you could try explaining that it was the will of the people that you had a new TV.You wouldn’t do that, though, would you? There’s a law against you stealing things, even when you really, really want them. If you get caught in the act, you don’t get to keep your ill-gotten gains, you get to visit your local police station and you get to have a criminal record that might well ruin your life.Steal a referendum result, on the other hand, and – even if you get caught – you get to keep your winnings.            READ MORE: Official Brexit campaign ‘broke electoral law’Last week, the Vote Leave campaign, which celebrated victory in the 2016 EU referendum, leaked news that the Electoral Commission was set to find it breached electoral law during the Brexit referendum.In what appeared to be an effort to take back control of this particular story, this particular group of  Brexiteers let it be known that the commission had accused them of breaking their official spending limit of £7 million by passing donations to another campaign group – BeLeave – with which it was allegedly co-ordinating operations.If, indeed, Vote Leave did break electoral law during the campaign, one might be forgiven for expecting that there would be some pretty serious consequences.             After all, ignoring the law in order to win a referendum that will change the course of British history might be considered a more serious matter than half-inching a telly.If the law on spending limits – put in place (and here’s a laugh) to stop the wealthy simply buying victories – really meant anything, there would be police involvement. As it is, this piece of civil, rather than criminal, law is utterly worthless.The toughest sanction available to the electoral commission is the imposition of a fine of up to £20,000. To a millionaire campaigner willing to ignore the law, that might seem like very good value indeed.The spin from pro-Brexit politicians, campaigners, and commentators is that none of this had any impact on the result of the referendum a majority would have voted Leave, regardless of the amount any of the participants had spent. If this is so, one wonders why they felt the need to spend anything on the campaign at all.Remainers hoping that the Electoral Commission’s findings might have some impact on the result are to be disappointed.             It’s no wonder Vote Leave was so relaxed about revealing some of the detail of its own alleged misdeeds.But this scandal – and it is a bloody scandal, regardless of how it might be dismissed by the braying Brexiteers of Little England – should have consequences for future elections and referendums. It is time for spending on campaigns to be a matter of criminal rather than civil law.I fear, however, that we will see little appetite for this necessary change from the main political parties.It is an open secret that participants in elections regularly ignore the rules and regulations that are supposed to ensure financial fair play. As one campaigner put it to me last week: “We all do it and nobody wants to make an issue of it. If we start throwing accusations at our opponents, they’ll start throwing accusations at us. Everyone’s hands are dirty.”This cosy, all-in-the-sewer-together understanding makes a mockery of already toothless legislation surrounding spending limits.An especially bleak irony of the electoral commission’s findings, as leaked by Vote Leave, is that the Brexit campaign was driven by a populist message that departure from the EU would empower those who felt left behind by “political elites” or “the establishment” when the reality, it appears, is that the only people truly empowered by it are a financial elite whose contempt for the law (for what it is currently worth, which is nothing) is out there in the open, now, for all to see.When those who value “Britishness” talk about what it actually means, they will tell you that they pride themselves on our collective sense of fair play.If those Brexiteers who made so much about British values during the 2016 campaign truly meant what they say, they would be clamouring for a re-run of the referendum. A result obtained by murky means, with the law ignored, is surely fundamentally un-British, isn’t it?Anyone who dares to question the validity of a victory secured by a campaign that broke electoral law should expect to be dismissed as an out-of-touch “Remoaner”. The rag-bag of libertarians, right-wing obsessives, and downright racists who are currently pushing for Brexit at any cost will have their way.I can’t see any good reason that anyone – regardless of their political position – would oppose turning the regulation of campaign funding from a civil to a criminal matter. After all, don’t we all want to ensure the high standards politicians talk about to be a reality rather than just another bit of meaningless spin?The EU referendum result will have consequences for generations to come. Those who secured that victory may consider themselves very fortunate indeed that the law governing the way the referendum was conducted is meaningless."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765532.1530903746!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan closing private schools makes inequality worse","story":"        Pricing out middle-class will create ever-more exclusive institutions, writes John McLellan.                Class warriors of the nation rejoice: one bourgeois institution down, just 69 to go. That bastion of inequality and privilege in Central Scotland, Beaconhurst School, is no more. Cliftonhall, Lomond, St Columba’s ... we’re coming for you next.            In the face of increasing pressure on costs and fees, and the prospect of the loss of charitable rates relief in 2020-21, Beaconhurst announced a merger with Morrison’s Academy, 20 miles away in Crieff, with the hope that its Bridge of Allan campus could be maintained for its junior school pupils in a satellite operation.            But by Wednesday the game was up. The school conceded the exodus of families making their own arrangements – many would have been put off by the prospect of a 40-mile round-trip to the senior school and Dollar Academy is nearer – meant the deal was no longer viable. Beaconhurst will cease to exist and the buildings will probably be sold for development, almost certainly houses, given how quickly a nearby Cala estate sold out. Regular trains to Glasgow and Edinburgh mean Bridge of Allan and Dunblane properties go for Edinburgh prices.Beaconhurst joins Westbourne, Laurel Bank, St Denis and Cranley and, eight years ago, St Margaret’s in Edinburgh, on the list of defunct private schools and it won’t be the last if the rate of fee increases continues to outstrip earnings and closes off the option for more families. Not that independent schools ever expect much sympathy from the Scottish political establishment, but in the last academic year the sector has been subjected to sustained pressure, particularly the confirmation in December of the Scottish Government’s plan to end charitable rates relief.READ MORE: Beaconhurst school in Bridge of Allan ‘likely to close’ following mergerThe argument that the tax change only addressed an anomaly – whereby state schools did not receive rates relief and paid the full amount – was a red herring because the payment was just an accounting device in which councils effectively paid themselves from one part of their books to another.            With a bill totalling about £5m a year for the sector, the impact on fees has been estimated at between £200-£300 a year on day fees of £12,000, or about two per cent. With fee increases now running well ahead of inflation, such as the five per cent just announced at George Watson’s, by the time charitable relief disappears senior school day fees could easily be hitting £14,000. For families with two children at senior school, finding £28,000 represents a net weekly income of £538 which is just £56 below the average UK household income, according to the latest “Living Standards, Poverty and Inequality” report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies. On the reasonable presumption that the average UK family does not have two kids at private school, it’s a fair guess that to meet school fees on top of all other living costs will require a net weekly income of just over £1,000, which is into the top five percent of earnings and a gross income in the region of £70,000. Even in a wealthy city like Edinburgh where a quarter of the total school population, over 11,000 children, are privately educated, that’s a lot of families who have to be right at the top of the wages league over a long period of time for this to be sustainable.Private school critics, like Labour’s Lord George Foulkes and Green MSP Andy Wightman, will shed few tears at the prospect of more parents rejecting the private option because of cost, but far from tackling inequality it will only make it worse as the offspring of the ultra-affluent are concentrated in fewer, more exclusive institutions bankrolled by international elites.Deliberately squeezing private education through punitive taxes is also a disincentive for the schools to increase their work with the state sector, calling into question collaborative projects like the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh at George Watson’s, a joint venture with James Gillespie’s and Boroughmuir. It’s now being extended to other schools. At the same time, Edinburgh council couldn’t even build the new Boroughmuir big enough to meet its basic needs in the coming years. The list of joint projects between private and state is lengthy and benefits both, but the unfortunate lesson of last year for the independent sector is why go to the trouble when the reward is a political kicking?             READ MORE: John McLellan: A strange obsession with expensive tramsA bursary to inspireA former contributor to The Scotsman’s sports pages, the teacher, ex-Hutchesons’ Grammar depute rector, and latterly popular after-dinner-speaker, Sandy Strang died after a very short illness last year and the school has just announced the establishment of the Sandy Strang Bursary Project thanks to a donation of £100,000 from his estate.The school needs to raise a minimum of a further £300,000 to build a sustainable fund, which will be used to widen access to more pupils from less well-off backgrounds and hopes Strang’s mantra that “much is expected from those to whom much is given” will inspire the hundreds of people he influenced as a teacher to donate. I‘m in.Booty-licious route to a job            If there was one thing Sandy Strang understood, it was rigorous application, and a couple of weeks ago I wrote about the importance of university graduates understanding their degree classifications were worth less than a CV packed with extra-curricular activities and work experience. Not so at The Spectator magazine, run by this paper’s former political editor, Fraser Nelson, where a strict “no CVs” policy applies to applications for paid internships.Sandy would have appreciated the stiff set of tasks set for hopefuls, such as provide “a one-page summary on the dismal state of the German military” and “suggest three guests for a podcast discussion on the recent Slovakian crisis”. But he would have loved the demand for “socioeconomic support for any two Beyoncé lyrics”. Like, perhaps, Booty-licious?Says Nelson: “We don’t care where, when or even whether you went to university.” But what if you don’t like Beyoncé?Anyone but England\u2028And finally to Russia and this afternoon’s big game, which Cambridge football blue Strang would have relished.

Handing over the Moray airbase to the defence umbrella organisation will be a key proposal of a paper looking at defence strategies should Scotland become independent post-Brexit.            The paper, being written by Stuart Crawford, a defence commentator and former Army officer, will argue that strategic and economic benefits would result from his proposal.            Crawford told Scotland on Sunday that turning RAF Lossiemouth into a Nato airbase would see the defence alliance provide an independent Scotland with a ready-made maritime patrol and fast jet force to defend the strategically important “High North”.The SNP has already expressed concern that the UK government is failing to do enough to protect the areas to the north of Scotland from Russian incursions.Crawford said the presence of Nato aircraft at Lossiemouth would remove the need for an independent Scotland’s defence force to purchase its own expensive patrol and fighter aircraft.He added that a Nato airbase, similar to the one in Ramstein in Germany, would bring significant investment to rural Scotland.“There would be considerable investment from Nato in setting something like this up,” said Crawford. “Lossiemouth would no longer be a domestic airbase in a country that happens to be a Nato member, but would be a base specifically for Nato operations.”             “It would seem to me to bring about the double benefit of both providing on-site air defence in terms of fast jet and maritime patrol for Scotland plus the economic benefit from the investment to enable Lossiemouth to be a true Nato base. That would involve the infrastructure for non-British Nato personnel, who would be posted there on a semi-permanent basis.”He added: “Another benefit for Scotland would be that an independent Scotland’s defence forces would not need fast jet aircraft of that type, which would help, given a limited defence budget.”Crawford claimed the idea had been discussed in SNP circles but the party had not adopted it as policy.The SNP’s attitude towards Nato has been a controversial area for the party in the past. Historically it was opposed to Nato membership, because the vast majority of members are implacably opposed to nuclear weapons.            Ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, the SNP conference narrowly voted in favour of dropping its long-standing opposition to Nato after a passionate debate that exposed splits in the party on the issue.At the time, the SNP leadership under Angus Robertson felt the party had to embrace the defence alliance even though it disapproved of its commitment to nuclear weapons. The vote was held because those at the top of the party believed the SNP’s anti-Nato stance was a vote loser with the public at large.Crawford acknowledged that many within the SNP still viewed Nato with deep suspicion. But he said: “If a small country with a population of five and a half million wants to be independent, turning your back on Nato is not very clever.“The fact that Nato ties the USA and Canada into European defence issues means it is the only game in town at the moment.”As far as Lossiemouth’s location was concern, Crawford argued that it had “easy access” to the North Sea and North Atlantic.            “It is ideally located for the High North. There is increased acknowledgement that the High North has deposits of minerals, oil and gas which are strategically important. If you look at the countries which border on the High North, Russia is one of the biggest ones. It may be that increased Russian activities in terms of their submarine operations and their air surveillance operations in the High North, is allied to their recognition of the strategic importance in relation to what that region might contain resources wise.”Over the years, Nato allies have deployed many aircraft to RAF Lossiemouth. For example, 37 aircraft from the US, Germany and France were temporarily deployed to Moray in 2016. This was a 76 per cent increase on the previous year when 21 Nato aircraft were deployed.SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald refused to be drawn on Crawford’s proposal.McDonald said: “I’m not going to get into that, because we are working on stuff looking at independence and I don’t want to get tied into that because all of that is a project that’s on-going.“Sometimes Stuart Crawford has good ideas, sometimes he has not so good ideas. I am trying to get to a situation where we start talking about defence in an independent Scotland that built on the last case, and I am not yet in the position where I want to start having a public conversation on it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch.

It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

All three would be reported for drink driving offences, police confirmed.\nOver the next fortnight officers will carry out high visibility patrols and roadside checks aimed at removing drink drivers from the roads.\nThey will also be watching for early morning motorists who may be under the influence from the night before.\nRoad Policing Inspector Neil Lumsden said: \"With the fine weather and the holiday season starting, it is a good opportunity of socialise with friends and family.\n\"If you go out planning to have a drink then make sure you have a safe plan for getting home - whether it is walking, public transport or taxi.\n\"If it is more spontaneous and unplanned, go through the same thought process and make sure you know how you\u0026rsquoll get home before you have that first drink.\n\"The next morning, make sure you are safe to drive before getting back behind the wheel. We will be watching for drivers still over the limit in the mornings so don\u0026rsquot take the risk.\n\"Everything we do is aimed at improving the safety of everyone using our roads. The message is simple - there is no safe limit. If you need to drive then do not drink at all.\n\"We use intelligence from our communities to shape our patrols and I would urge anyone with concerns about drink drivers to pass this on to us so we can take the appropriate action.\n\"You are not being a killjoy in doing this, you are playing your part in keeping our roads safe.\n\"We want people to be able to enjoy themselves this summer and with a little forward-planning you can make sure you do so safely.\"\nAnyone with concerns about a suspected drink driver can call Police Scotland on 101 or 999 in an emergency situation.

During 2017/18, more than 3,700 Highland pupils benefited from a school clothing grant.\nThe additional funding will be allocated to top up the existing rate, taking the council\u0026rsquos grant amount to \u0026pound140 per pupil.\n\"This exceeds the \u0026pound100 minimum amount agreed with the Scottish Government by \u0026pound40 from academic year 2018/19,\" a council spokesperson said today (Monday June 18).\nCouncillor Alister MacKinnon, chair of the corporate resources committee, added: \"Passing on 100% the funding from the Scottish Government for school clothing grants is the right thing to do for our school pupils.\n\"The austerity cuts continue to place many families in financial hardship and low income families in Highland. A grant of \u0026pound140 per pupil will help our learners to participate in school life and ease the financial pressures for parents and carers. I urge all eligible families to apply for this grant.\"\nCouncillor Andrew Baxter, care, learning and housing chair, said \"Providing this level of financial assistance with the costs of school clothing for eligible families means that Highland pupils are better equipped to attend school and to focus on their education without the stigma of wearing clothes that simply don\u0026rsquot fit. Assisting parents and carers with the costs of school clothing can help to alleviate poverty in the Highlands. \"\nLeader of the Council Councillor Margaret Davidson commented: \"The average cost of clothing primary and secondary school pupils in Highland is now estimated to range from around \u0026pound106 to \u0026pound130 per pupil which is a significant outlay for parents. I very much welcome this increase in school clothing grant as it helps to reduce inequalities for Highland families and is one of the measures being taken to proactively address poverty, and in particular child poverty.\"\nApplications are now being invited for the academic year starting in August 2018. To streamline the application process, the council has a single application form for school clothing grants and free school meals. They are available from the operations team on 01463 703645.\nHelp with completing the form is also available from the welfare support team: Freephone 0800 090 1004.\nPictured: Councillors MacKinnon

the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSunday 8 Jul 2018 3:51
