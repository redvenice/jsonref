You were putting an appeal in to get her prosecuted, you never bothered to see her.\u0027If it had been... an ordinary person, you wouldn\u0027t have prosecuted.\u0027I see domestic abuse and I just think you should be disgusted with yourself so there is nothing we can do to bring Caroline back. I hope in hindsight you do regret this. This girl killed herself because you put an appeal through.\u0027Earlier in the hearing DI Batemen had insisted she had not treated the presenter any differently because she was famous and would not change her decisions.She said a caution was not appropriate because Flack did not admit her guilt in a police interview, although she had said \u0027I hit him, he was cheating on me\u0027 at the scene.Mr Daw, the author of Justice on Trial, said she should have been given the chance to agree to the lesser police action.He said: \u0027What should have happened here is that she should have been offered a caution, in the cold light of day I strongly expect from experience, had she been offered one her lawyers would have advised her to accept it and in all probability she would have done.\u0027The CPS came to the view that a caution was appropriate, yet the police were adamant for reasons I don\u0027t understand that there had to be a criminal prosecution.\u0027It seems to me that the system failed on a number of levels. It failed because there appears to have been undue influence by two factors, her high profile and therefore there\u0027s a desire not be seen to be going soft on someone who is in the public eye and risking adverse public comment – that was a factor undoubtedly in this case.\u0027This is not a case where there was evidence where the victim was under coercion or so vulnerable he was incapable of making a decision on what was best for him – and there are such cases, where the victim wants to withdraw the complaint through fear.\u0027We have had victims of domestic violence committing suicide because they are forced into the court system.\u0027Here we have a decision in principle by the CPS prosecution was not in the public interest and having made that decision they are persuaded to change that assessment by the police even though it\u0027s nothing to do with the police. The police have no role in the public interest, it\u0027s not their job, their job is to investigate and present the file to the CPS – it is not to decide what is in the public interest.\u0027My major concern here is that the CPS\u0027s decision, which is so fundamental in the system about public interest, was overridden by the police – that shouldn\u0027t happen. I don\u0027t accept that is a legitimate exchange of views between the CPS and the police.\u0027  A CPS spokesperson said it stood by its decision and said Flack\u0027s fame had no bearing on it.They added: \u0027A suspect\u0027s celebrity status is not a factor in our decisions to prosecute.\u0027Our handling of this case was carefully reviewed throughout and our guidance and legal tests were followed.We are satisfied that the prosecution was correctly brought. \u0027The issue of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health was addressed on a number of occasions throughout the legal process. Our decisions were made on the basis of the medical opinion available to us each time.\u0027As the inquest heard there was clearly a more significant history of issues and a further deterioration of Miss Flack\u0027s mental health of which we had not been made aware.\u0027 Justice on Trial: Radical Solutions for a System at Breaking Point: Chris Daw: Bloomsbury Continuum"},{"url":null,"title":"North London landlord rents garden shed 1 500 month","story":"Share this article The little home is in a large \u0027well kept\u0027 garden with an outdoor deck and private entrance, just a short bus ride away from Highgate Station.There is underfloor heating, a small, fully-equipped kitchen and a \u0027stylish new shower room\u0027 with wood effect tiles.The landlord describes one of the bedrooms as a \u0027charming and magical mezzanine sleeping area\u0027.\u0027Wake up to the smell of pine and the birds singing,\u0027 the advert says.Only one other room with a single bed is pictured. The rent includes all bills, wifi and free parking. Smoking and pets are not allowed, but the landlord will consider short term lets.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/448fb2745ef767e0566013c3aea95f5c44699439/152_177_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b0579a36621183cea456b26e7195c1","title":"newcastle west end elswick to newburn in pictures","story":"Photographer Mark Pinder recalls the years he spent in Newcastle’s West End in a collection of pictures documenting the six miles along the river Tyne from Elswick to Newburn, where the west of the city meets the countryside.Mark Pinder’s Newcastle West End: Elswick to Newburn is published by Cafe Royal BooksIn 1987, aged 20, I returned to Newcastle, having been away for four years. I needed somewhere to live and I ended up taking the keys to a two-bedroom upstairs Tyneside flat in Scotswood for the “huge sum” of £29 a week. It was film or rent, and I chose film.Even in its heyday, the West End of Newcastle, and Scotswood especially, had always had a certain reputation for its poverty and deprivation, most notoriously as the home to the child killer Mary Bell back in the 1960s. But by the mid- to late-1980s it had been hit extremely hard by the waves of deindustrialisation that had closed down most of Armstrong’s munitions works, the area’s biggest employer, that ran all the way from Elswick to Scotswood along Scotswood Road, heading west out of Newcastle.In September 1991, the West End of Newcastle was hit by riots that spread across Tyneside after two joy-riders died in a police chase on the Coast Road at Wallsend to the east of Newcastle. By comparison to events such as Handsworth or the Broadwater Farm riots, the rioting was pretty subdued, but it still resulted in the burning out of the post office on Armstrong Road where I’d photographed women queuing to cash their child benefit cheques four years earlier.Despite being largely forgotten, these riots caused ructions among policymakers and politicians because of their nihilism – lacking the ready-causes such as the institutionalised racism Leslie Scarman addressed in the wake of the Brixton and Toxteth riots in the early 1980s. The causes of these riots were structural to the Thatcherite project that no fact-finding visits by Michael Heseltine were going to address adequately. We are still living with the consequences three decades later.Most of the pictures in this series were shot incidentally as I’d go for a walk, go get the bus, or just live my life rather than as a specific project. It has resulted in a broad survey of the historical, political and economic changes that my home region has undergone and these photographs are simply one strand of a much wider, more polemical essay charting my own responses to those changes.Living there for nine years was often surreal, as “twocked” and burnt cars became so common that it took something interesting such as a Mini stuffed down the steps of the Old Scotswood station to register as a bit unusual.I moved from Scotswood in 1996, having lived there for 9 years. The area was in seemingly terminal decline as the anti-social behaviour grew, and my old street was finally flattened in the early 2000s, despite the tens of millions of pounds that had been pumped into the area in the wake of the rioting.Jeremy Deller, an artist, wanted to be photographed in a Coronation Street setting. Although Robert Street in Scotswood, where I was living at the time, was not exactly like Salford, all we had to do was go out of my front door for a suitably “northern” location, where we proceeded to photograph each other. Technicolor was still several years off – and the north of England really felt black and white in those days.The lower part of Scotswood and Benwell, above Scotswood Road, is currently being redeveloped as part of a large publicprivate initiative to build housing and attract people back to the area. If it can rid itself of the stigma of poverty and deprivation that blighted the area for many years, it does have a lot going for it, such as wonderful views across the Tyne valley and great transport links – being close to the A1, which runs northsouth, and the A69, which runs eastwest.• Mark Pinder is a documentary and editorial photographer living near Newcastle upon Tyne. He is currently working on a book and exhibition project with the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art in Sunderland exploring the political and social history of his home region.

This was the closest, physically, I had been to someone outside of my household in months.Without any hope of maintaining social distance, a few bemused passengers, including myself, queried our seating arrangements with the sympathetic flight attendants. The response? That unless we had paid for a reservation then we had been placed in seats at random.One can only assume, therefore, that to absolutely ensure a socially distanced flight, Ryanair passengers must pay extra (between £3 and £7 each way for my flights).With worldwide government warnings that maintaining a distance of at least 1 metre, if not more, from each other was absolutely essential to avoid transmission of coronavirus, it seemed rather surprising that the airline did not allocate seats further apart. Especially on a partially empty flight.However, after we took off most passengers, including myself, simply moved to an empty row of seats and managed to independently socially distance.Without firm instructions from the government, policies differ significantly from one carrier to the next, and blocking seats to encourage social distancing is not yet a blanket policy.Back to Ryanair and its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, says there are no plans to socially distance in the skies. In fact O’Leary said the airline would not be looking at keeping the middle seat free, describing the idea as “mad”, “hopelessly ineffective” and unaffordable. Instead, he shifted the responsibility for passenger safety on to the government calling for temperature checks at the airport.So recent headlines  that Italy’s aviation regulator has threatened to ban Ryanair, alleging that the airline has not complied with rules brought in to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, are not at all surprising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3161307ade11d12bda1edbe4898fa3e36d1639c9/0_46_3504_2101/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a34c495798fc693662c7ecc91c35120a","title":"rick stein urges unemployed chefs to join his cornish empire","story":"Restaurateur and TV celebrity struggling to fill 39 vacancies across his 13 eateries in south-westThe TV chef and food writer Rick Stein is urging unemployed chefs in other parts of the UK to consider moving to Cornwall to work in his family’s restaurant empire.The restaurant and hotel group, which has 13 eateries, is trying to fill 39 vacancies, including for a pastry chef and junior sous chef at its famous Seafood Restaurant in Padstow.“If you have found yourself out of work due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I urge you to consider coming to Cornwall,” said Stein. “It’s thriving, and with travel bans still in place there is great hope that the staycation will extend through to early winter and bring some much-needed revenue to the locality.”With a number of local staff opting not to return to customer-facing roles, Stein said there was a need for new talent in the business. “I would love to see new members of the team coming from more hard-hit areas of the country,” he said.Azzurri Group (includes Ask Italian and Zizzi) 1,200 jobs lost and 75 restaurants closed ahead of sale to private equity firmByron 31 out of 51 restaurants closed in rescue deal, with 650 job losses.Carluccio’s Collapsed In March.

In 2019 the group received 5,500 applications over the whole year. One demi-chef position received 111 applications, which is 10 times the usual level, the company said. For some roles there is help with accommodation.However, despite the high volume of applications, Michael Rabone, the group’s head of human resources, said it was struggling with a large number of “no-shows”.“We’ve seen a noticeable increase in the number of no-shows at all stages of the recruitment process,” said Rabone. “This includes candidates that apply and cannot be contacted, candidates invited to interview that do not attend, and iniduals offered roles that do not start work.”The family-run group has not emerged unscathed from the crisis, which forced restaurants and bars to shut for several months.

Sandwich sales fell by nearly £1.3bn in lockdown, compared with the same period last year, according to analysts Kantar.Admittedly, the sandwich is not a perfect pandemic food to satisfactorily eat one you must repeatedly suck on your own fingers. But the sandwich is a national habit so ingrained, and so compulsive, it is a wonder coronavirus could break it. In a normal year we eat about 11.5bn sandwiches. That’s about 200 each per year, per adult. As the food writer Bee Wilson wrote in her 2010 book on the subject, the sandwich is less a meal than a “way of life”.The death of the sandwich is the death of a particular way of thinking about lunch, and about time. Born in Marks \u0026amp Spencer in the spring of 1980 – 43p, salmon and cucumber – the invention of the chilled packaged sandwich spoke to a new sort of working culture, one where it was no longer necessary to stop working to eat. As Jim Winship, the president of the British Sandwich Association told this newspaper in 2017, the sandwich produces billions of pounds of added productivity throughout the economy by “allowing people to work through lunch”.But the way I eat sandwiches – breathlessly, without really chewing – no longer makes any sense to me. Like most office workers in the UK, I don’t work in an office any more. I’m not doing anything very important. I’m now not sure that I ever was. There is no one to perform my busyness to.If the sandwich is a way of life, it is an interestingly selfish one. You eat a sandwich alone, at your desk, using only one hand. The other hand is free to stroke your phone. Whereas most food is communal, “the sandwich frees you from the social, it is almost designed to allow you to be on your own,” Polly Russell, the food historian, told me.Despite being done in plain sight, the gobbling of a sandwich is a strangely private thing – one friend describes the experience of being eyed too closely by his boss while arranging his sandwich (egg mayonnaise, with McCoy’s crisps slipped in) as a kind of affront: “It was like being caught with my pants down.”There’s also a sense – illusory or otherwise – in which the very act of choosing a sandwich is an assertion of personality. In any given supermarket, there are upwards of 50 different flavours. “Choice is bound up with the idea of inidual freedom and autonomy,” says Russell. “A sort of ability to be a fully modern person.” Stripped, for months, of the capacity to legally socialise, the idea of eating alone has rather lost its shine. What people want from food, in the context of coronavirus, is not privacy – it’s intimacy.Many tradespeople, healthcare and public transport workers have never been able to work remotely – and significantly, they’re still buying sandwiches. “The people with the luxury of being able to work from home are typically higher paid,” says Patrick Coveney, the chief executive of Greencore, who supply two-thirds of all supermarket sandwiches in the UK. Since coronavirus, Greencore’s average customer is poorer, and more likely to live outside of a big city. The company’s response, according to Coveney, has been to stop making anything too niche and to double down on the icons. The sandwich aisle tells the story of who has been permitted to rest and who has had to work through this pandemic. You can read it in the ingredients: more ham and cheese less gluten-free.It is one of the curiosities of the business that while there are an almost infinite number of things you can put between two slices of bread, the top sellers remain predictably constant. Greencore’s top five sandwiches – ham and cheese, chicken and bacon, chicken caesar wrap, BLT, chicken salad – haven’t changed in a decade. I have eaten a Tesco tuna and cucumber sandwich four times a week for the past three years. We might think we have choices, that our sandwich selection reflects our power to shape the course of our days, but industry analysis suggests that most people eat the same sandwich, week in week out, for the whole of their lives.My mother talks about Pret’s cheese and pickle like it’s a reprieve. “I can’t see anything else while I’m eating. It’s like putting on a hood.” The sandwich is a reliable 3.5 minutes of pleasure in the middle of an often pleasureless routine. But we have broken routines now – time is weighted differently – and we are tentatively renegotiating the relationship between working and eating.Coronavirus has given some of us the opportunity to experience lunch as something other than a consolation. We are thinking again about the value of pleasure. And wondering if we would like to experience it for more than 3.5 minutes.• Kitty Drake is a writer and editor based in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93364df6df8c71b2faa48ecb5ca71e1a994745b/0_1286_2567_1540/master/2567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=061f2dba194411d10e020e0c5e42313e","title":"gyles brandreth funniest things","story":"The writer, broadcaster, standup, actor and former Conservative MP on the things that make him laugh the mostKen Dodd at the London Palladium 30 years ago.

Then it was never seen again … until now “I saw it when it was first shown,” says the film critic Kim Newman. “Christmas Eve with my mum and dad. We all just wanted to watch a spooky ghost story. But there were after-effects, a mood that carried on after the film ended. You wake up next morning, Christmas Day, you’re still scared …”He laughs darkly. “The Woman in Black ruined Christmas.”Few horror films have acquired the cult reputation of Herbert Wise’s TV production of The Woman in Black. Adapted by visionary British sci-fi screenwriter Nigel Kneale from Susan Hill’s 1983 novella, it stars a 31-year-old Adrian Rawlins as Edwardian solicitor Arthur Kidd, sent to settle the estate of an eccentric widow, Mrs Drablow, on the north-east coast of England. There, in a remote house at the end of a shingle causeway, he is tormented by terrifying noises and cries – and appearances from a tall woman dressed in black (Pauline Moran), who comes to exert a malevolent hold over his life.The film was a hit with critics and audience alike, yet while Hill’s book went on to sell millions and become a set GCSE text, and Stephen Mallatratt’s stage adaptation began a West End run in 1989 that was halted by Covid-19, Wise’s film slid into relative obscurity.After briefly surfacing on WH Smith’s own-brand VHS label in 1991 and screening on Channel 4 in 1994, it disappeared. Partly owing to its scarcity a mystique grew around it, with copies passed from hand to hand on dubbed VHS and hooky DVDs. In later years, it has made fleeting illegal appearances on YouTube, accompanied by comments speculating darkly on the reasons for its disappearance.The League of Gentlemen creators are vocal fans: Reece Shearsmith has called it “the most terrifying programme I’ve ever seen”, while Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro cites it in his list of favourite supernatural films. So what are the reasons for its enduring power? Why did it disappear? And why, after all this time, is it coming back?Andy Nyman, co-creator, with the League of Gentlemen’s Jeremy Dyson of the long-running stage-play Ghost Stories and its 2017 film adaptation, has a particular interest in the film, as it gave him his first ever acting role, aged 23, as a young office clerk.Rawlins agrees. “You grow to like my character,” says the 62-year-old star of Chernobyl and the Harry Potter films. “When the bad things happen there’s a part of you thinking, ‘You can’t do that!’ There’s a famous point in the film and even though I was in it, I’m watching it, and going, ‘Oh my God! No! That’s not right!’”Much of the film’s power lies in Moran’s portrayal of the woman in black herself, particularly the wordless, withering glares of hatred she directs at Rawlins’ character. “I was cast for my ability to convey malevolence, with no warmth at all,” says Moran, now a sprightly 72. “In those days I was quite pre-Raphaelite and ethereal. There’s a sadness in there, and a pure hate for what’s being done to her. I tried to convey what’s happening in her mind.”By the conventions of the modern horror film, the woman in black is seen rarely and – with one big exception – from a distance. “I deliberately didn’t show her close up,” the late Wise said in 2015, “because then the audience can construct a face which is horrible to you, your personal horror.”“After the film came out Susan Hill sort of dismissed it,” says Moran. “I suppose she felt it became more Nigel Kneale’s version, but Nigel knows what he is doing. He wrote Quatermass and The Stone Tape.”“Nigel was a huge HG Wells fan,” explains Newman, “and he was deeply offended that Susan Hill named her lead character Kipps after the Wells novel, so he changed it to Kidd. But he made so many brilliant technical changes for TV, including putting the biggest, most famous scare just before an ad break. It’s probably the most necessary ad break in the history of television.”Because of her objections, many imagined Hill was the reason behind the film’s disappearance after 1991. Not so, she says: “I haven’t owned the rights since they first went to ITV. None of this has anything to do with me.”In fact, the trail went quiet until the Hammer Films company was revived in 2007 and decided to remake The Woman in Black for a new audience. “We acquired the rights from a company called Talisman, a guy called Richard Jackson,” explains Hammer CEO Simon Oakes. “There’s no great mystery there. He just hadn’t had a decent offer until we came along. With that came what you might call ‘blocking rights’: the legal right not to have competing versions. You’d be mad to have the television version out on DVD while the theatrical version is still on the market.”Written by Jane Goldman, directed by James Watkins and starring Daniel Radcliffe in his first film after Harry Potter, Hammer’s remake of The Woman in Black grossed $129m worldwide and became the most successful British horror film of all time, even giving rise to a 2014 sequel, The Woman in Black: Angel of Death. With that came a renewed interest in the original.Beautifully restored to a cinema-quality print, and finally available for all to see, Herbert Wise’s The Woman in Black can now take its rightful place as one of the greatest and scariest British horror films of all time. And arguably one of the most influential.“One thing worth pointing out,” says Newman, “is that the woman in black is one of the few English ghosts who is not tied to her location. Also, in his adaptation, Kneale omits all her motivation. In that sense, she prefigures those characters from Japanese horror films like Ring. She’s a malevolent, non-specific spirit.”Even Hill has finally come round to the adaptation. “It is very frightening,” she says. “Ever since its first transmission I have been asked if it will ever be shown again. Now it is. And when anyone complains that ‘it has changed the book’, my answer is always the same. Of course it hasn’t … the book is still there for everyone to read – and quite unchanged!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ed7b2efa79fd66024b745964cd82ea8ce6e8d21/73_189_3434_2060/master/3434.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a767991bf9ac9f5e8044496a65a73e03","title":"manchester city real madrid champions league match report","story":"Manchester City were relentless in a dazzling performance of shock-and-awe attacking that pinned back Real Madrid from kick-off to final whistle. It gave Pep Guardiola’s team – and the club – its finest Champions League result and pits them against Lyon in the quarter-finals.Zinedine Zidane’s team were just not allowed to breathe, and in Eden Hazard had an A-list act reduced to a bit-part due to City’s dominance. Downing the record 13-times winners in this manner will surely rocket confidence and convince City they can go on and claim the competition for the first time in their history.For City’s biggest game of the season Phil Foden was retained while Ilkay Gündogan and Fernandinho replaced David Silva and Eric Garcia - the latter perhaps losing a berth for his refusal of a new contract.Zidane brought in Eder Militão for the suspended Sergio Ramos, Real’s record in Europe without their captain dire: of his six games missed in the past two years five were defeats. The equation for City was simple: keep Real to even a 1-0 defeat and the two away goals scored 163 days ago in Spain would put them through.On a sultry evening it was noticeable how much louder City’s support was from assembled substitutes and staff, a marker of the high-stakes, and Guardiola will have been pleased at how his team controlled proceedings until half-time.They were jubilant after nine minutes. Here, Thibaut Courtois passed to Raphaël Varane where the No 5 hardly wanted it: near goal and with Gabriel Jesus all over him. A clumsy touch and the Brazilian had the ball. From here Real were in a nightmare as Jesus found Raheem Sterling who finished for a 31st this season and 100th for the club.Zidane was dismayed and City were at Real’s throats. Phil Foden, playing as the “No 9”, raced down the right and pulled the trigger. The ball went to Gündogan and his shot was blocked.There was zero let-up: City were a blue swarm their visitors could not repel. Militão this time was chief dawdler, allowing Sterling to charge him down and he was lucky to win a foul. Now De Bruyne glided into space, threaded possession to Sterling and the No 7 swivelled and unloaded at Courtois, who got nowhere near the ball. He was relieved to see it dip too late.Sterling and Foden were a double act cutting through Real at will. The latter fed the former and he zig-zagged past two defenders before Casemiro’s lunging tackle saved a second.Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema, finally, gave City a warning. Concerning here was how the striker made a mug of Aymeric Laporte with a sweet turn on receiving Hazard’s ball. His 20-yard effort was steered behind by Ederson but this was an augury of what was to come.City were lax as a sluggish João Cancelo was slipped by, Rodrygo crossed, and Benzema headed home. This had Real’s blood up in what was an open, attacking contest summed up by Kyle Walker slaloming to near Real’s area before blasting over.Tackles flew in, Casemiro mis-controlled, and Cancelo pummelled the ball at Courtois, who was fortunate his parry did not fall to Foden or Sterling.Another howler from Real’s No 1 that gave De Bruyne possession was nearly – again – disastrous: Foden’s lightning swivel-and-shot missed narrowly, as did a De Bruyne corner Courtois beat away from under his bar.City were in again early in the second half via Cancelo who could find only a pink shirted-opponent.Then, Sterling forced a point-blank save from Courtois and De Bruyne’s ensuing corner won another which he once more caused the busy keeper to glove out from a direct delivery.Real were struggling for rhythm. It was all too frantic due to City’s percussive pressing without ball and percussive passing with it. Still, a period passed of Real ascendancy as pink shirts took up occupancy in blue territory.A quick Foden break, though, and Sterling was in and Courtois had to thwart him.Despite the 400-contingent inside the stadium the atmosphere was electric. De Bruyne tormented Real with a surge that claimed a corner and it was admirable how positive City continued to be despite being only a conceded goal away from extra time.Benzema – twice – spurned openings to score this and when Jesus had Courtois palming over on 65 minute the pace remained breathless. City, though, were soon ecstatic: Jesus made it 4-2 on aggregate with a delightful stabbed finish past the stranded Courtois following Varane’s second awful howler – a weak back-pass of a header."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a081905c341c7bdd59b171c94a1e2a8b5c009daa/0_15_4448_2669/master/4448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961a5568a99f83a011a3d4e011ef38e5","title":"champions league last 16 second leg manchester city v real madrid live","story":"Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus took advantage of unusual errors from Raphael Varane to put Manchester City into the quarter-finalsJamie Jackson’s match report has landed, so I’ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company - goodnight.City will play... Lyon in the quarter-final next Saturday. They have surprisingly beaten Juventus on away goals in Turin, despite the best efforts of Cristiano Ronaldo. And although Lyon took four points off City in the group stages last season, Pep Guardiola’s team will be huge favourites. Manchester City are into the quarter-finals of the Champions League after an occasionally tense but ultimately comfortable win over Real Madrid. Raphael Varane was at fault for both goals, scored by Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus, and Karim Benzema’s equaliser on the night ultimately counted for nowt. City can pack their bags for Portugal knowing they are only three games from winning the Champions League.90 min Four minutes of added time.89 min Nicolas Otamendi replaces Rodri, who has cramp.88 min City are doing a bit of tiki-taka timewasting. Madrid know it’s over.86 min David Silva clips the free-kick just over the bar. It was a fine effort, which brushed the roof of the net on its way through.85 min De Bruyne is fouled just outside the area by Kroos. City have controlled the game really well since going 2-1 ahead.83 min A triple change for Real Madrid: Lucas Vazquez, Fede Valverde and Luka Jovic replace Modric, Carvajal and Hazard.81 min David Silva comes on for his last appearance at the Etihad, replacing the ever threatening Raheem Sterling.80 min Modric is booked for fouling De Bruyne, and is out of the quarter-final as a result. 79 min City are passing the clock down. Madrid need a goal quicksmart, and then another quicksmart after that.76 min “It seems churlish that Foden should have to come off because Pep the genius’s genius plan wasn’t working,” says Ian Copestake. “Pep should bring himself off, so to say.”75 min It’s been nervy at times, but City deserve to go through over the two legs. Barring a late twist, they will play either Cristiano Ronaldo or Lyon in the quarter-final a week tomorrow.72 min City appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty after a very clumsy tackle from Carvajal on Sterling. That looked like a decent shout, and Carvajal also gave away a penalty with a foul on Sterling in the first leg. A few seconds later, Walker’s low long-range drive is pushed away by the ing Courtois.71 min City have a four-on-three attack after another slight mistake from Varane. Bernardo Silva goes alone, with De Bruyne better placed, and eventually his shot is blocked.70 min Madrid need to score twice now. A penalty-box scramble ends with Modric’s shot from a tight angle being saved by the legs of Ederson.It’s another howler from Varane. His attempted backheader to Courtois was short, and Jesus, who had to take the shot first time from a very tight angle, stretched out his left foot to spin a superb finish past Courtois.Raphael Varane has put Manchester City in the quarter-finals! (Probably.)68 min “To Tony Patterson’s point, Pep loves playing midfielders in all positions, always has,” says Phil Podolsky. “Fernandinho is pretty spry for a wise 47-year-old who can read the game.”Thing is, I know you didn’t write these words, but whenever I look at your second sentence all I see is ‘YAYA TOURE, ROME, 2009, APPLES’.67 min A change for City: Phil Foden is replaced by Bernardo Silva.66 min: Excellent save from Courtois! This is terrific stuff now. De Bruyne and Gundogan combined to find Jesus, who dragged the ball away from Militao in one smooth movement and lifted a shot from 12 yards that was pushed over by Courtois.64 min A long ball over the top is helped across by Asensio to Benzema. He moves the ball onto his right foot, just inside the area, and slaps a shot that is straight at Ederson. That was a chance, and this is getting very squeaky for City.64 min If you don’t want to know the Juventus score, don’t read the next entry.63 min Benzema forces his way past Fernandino and Laporte on the edge of the area before king a shot that hits Laporte and goes behind for a corner.61 min A change for Madrid: Marco Asensio replaces Rodrygo.61 min City have been better in the last few minutes. Foden cuts infield and forces a pass to De Bruyne on the right side of the box. He hammers a low cross that deflects off Militao and whistles across the face of goal.60 min “Ramos a bartender?” says Peter Oh. “What’s his signature drink? Dirty Martini?”I heard it was Old Fashioned.59 min “It drives me absolutely mad that he plays for City, but what an absolutely brilliant pass from De Bruyne that was to set up Sterling,” says Matt Richman. “It is incredible how he can make one of the finest teams in Europe look like a set of training cones in the blink of an eye.” 58 min Gundogan clips a good first-time pass into the pass of De Bruyne, who storms forward from midfield. He reached the edge of the area before chopping back inside Militao and side-footing a low shot that deflected off the sliding Carvajal for a corner.56 min “Looking at the shirts on display, this appears to be a major derby between two fancy airlines: Etihad v Emirates,” says Peter Oh. “Fair play to them but I miss the Brother and Teka days. Typewriters and printers versus washing machines and microwave ovens. So much more relatable to the common football fan than luxury first class cabin service.”55 min Benzema welts one into orbit from distance.54 min: Good save from Courtois! Yet again it came from a Real mistake, this time a poor pass from Casemiro that went straight to Foden. He played it to Gundogan, who helped it on to the unmarked Sterling in the area. Gundogan’s pass was overhit, though, and that meant Courtois was able to narrow the angle and block Sterling’s shot. 54 min Real are starting to dominate possession. City will kick themselves forever and a day if they cock this up.53 min “I remember you writing years ago that Fergie overthought European games (playing the ghost of 1960 Hampden versus Madrid in 2000 at the Bernabeu for instance),” says Digvijay Yadav. “For Fergie then read Pep now.”Yeah, I think there’s something in that. Didn’t he leave De Bruyne out at Spurs last season? He tinkered at Liverpool in the league as well. I understand playing Gundogan for extra protection in midfield, especially as you don’t lose that much going forward, but I don’t really get some of Pep’s decisions in attack.52 min Rodrygo is fouled just outside the area by Joao Cancelo, but the referee waves play on. Real need to get Rodrygo on the ball more because he has the beating of Cancelo.49 min “Is there any truth to the story that Sergio Ramos travelled to the game on a fixie bike?” asks Matt Dony. “Has he bought any rare 180g vinyl records while in Manchester? Will he be enjoying some smashed avocado at half time? Is he going to try and sell me some ridiculously expensive gin infused with a hideous combination of flavours?”48 min De Bruyne again tries to score from a corner, the brazen genius, and this time Courtois has to e back towards the near post to push the ball away.48 min “I’m rooting for the underdog,” says Ian Copestake, “but in the absence of any am gunning for Ipswich Town.”47 min: Sterling misses a great chance! De Bruyne slid a delicious straight pass in between Varane and Carvajal to put Sterling through on goal, but he slashed his shot and Courtois spread himself to push it behind. I think it was going wide of the near post anyway.46 min Peep peep! City begin the second half, and Pep has switched his front three to their usual positions: Sterling left, Jesus centre, Foden right.Interesting, very interesting. City looked to be cruising into the quarter-finals when Raphael Varane farted around in his own area and gave Raheem Sterling an early goal, but Real slowly came to life Karim Benzema - who is giving a clinic in modern centre-forward play - equalised with an accomplished header. The next goal is a very, very, very, very, very, very big goal.45+1 min One minute of added time. De Bruyne almost scores from a corner, whipping an inswinger that is punched away from under the crossbar by the scrambling Courtois. I’m pretty sure that was a deliberate shot by De Bruyne.45 min “This might be controversial but I don’t think Fernandinho is great at centre back,” says Tony Patterson. “For me, he was at fault for the goal. Granted there aren’t many options for Pep but surely Stones with Laporte is better. Plus you’d get the benefit of being able to play Fernandinho in midfield.” 44 min Benzema volleys straight at Ederson from 10 yards. He was well offside and it wouldn’t have counted.42 min: So close from Foden! Real almost give City another goal. Courtois’s awful drilled pass went straight to De Bruyne 25 yards from goal. He pushed the ball into Foden, who turned on the edge of the D and drove a low shot just wide of the far post.42 min City are showing the first signs of frustration, mainly with the referee. This is all becoming a bit tense.40 min “Hey Rob,” says Matt Collins. “I see Ramos more as Judah Mannowdog, Princess Caroline’s hipster assistant from Bojack Horseman.”39 min I’m not sure Pep’s funky tactics have worked. Sterling has been dangerous, but Foden (false nine) and Jesus (left wing) have been peripheral.37 min Joao Cancelo sweeps a low shot from the edge of the area that is pushed away unconvincingly by Courtois. Thankfully for him the rebound goes to Militao, who lumps it clear. It could easily have gone straight to Gundogan, who would have had a tap-in.35 min No signs yet of any excess City nervousness, though I’d imagine that will change if Real get the next goal. It’s unthinkable that City could go out after being in complete control of the tie.33 min Kyle Walker shoots from 25 yards, and immediately regrets it.32 min “Hi Rob!” says Aadik Shekar. “That shot of Sergio Ramos celebrating the Benzema goal - looks like he should be bartending at some hipster cocktail bar w a password you’ve never heard of, no?”Ha ha, that’s the perfect description.31 min City were unusually passive during the spell leading up to Benzema’s equaliser. Now they are on the attack again. Despite the best efforts of Raphael Varane, this is turning into a cracking game.The talismanic Karim Benzema has brought Real back in the tie. He started the move with a short pass to Rodrygo just outside the area on the right. He poked the ball past Joao Cancelo and stood up a fine cross towards the six-yard line, where Benzema arrived late to plant an excellent downward header past Ederson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea2dcc5280de5fc5a7371639eb153074f223eec/82_86_3398_2040/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5724e6482f1ee0e5b930e48b5a3177b6","title":"juventus v lyon champions league last 16 second leg live","story":"Lyon hold on reach the quarter-finals for the first time in a decade despite two goals from Cristiano RonaldoThat’s all from me tonight. Thanks very much for following and we will see what this young, resourceful Lyon team is capable of on neutral ground in a week. Good night.Lyon will now face Manchester City next week in Lisbon. If you somehow don’t already know know, City rolled past Real Madrid after a couple of howlers from Raphael Varane.“Really embarrassing performance from Juventus,” says Karen Carney on BT Sport. As is so often the case, in the end only Cristiano Ronaldo looked like he was capable of winning the game for Juventus tonight. With the exception of perhaps Alex Sandro, so much of what Juventus produced today was uninspiring and bleak. More questions to be asked of Maurizio Sarri.There may be no atmosphere, but the emotions remain. Paulo Dybala is currently in tears in the crowd.Lyon take out Juventus! An incredible effort from Lyon in their second competitive month in five months.90 min+4 De Ligt is now playing as a forward as he concedes a free kick on the edge of Lyon’s box. These are desperate times for the home side. 90 min+3 Ronaldo’s free kick flies into the wall and is deflected for a corner. The Lyon players celebrated as if it were a goal itself before clearing the corner. Three minutes to go...90 min+2. Gonzalo Higuain hasn’t done much tonight but he just held up the ball excellently on the edge of the area to win a free kick for Ronaldo in a great position...90 min This is it. 6 minutes of added time stand between Lyon and a place in the quarters.88 min. Admirably, Lyon have not just parked their men behind the ball. They are still trying to finish on their terms, but as they chased another goal they were very nearly caught on the break. A cynical foul from Marçal on a counter attacking Ramsey earns him a yellow card, the ninth of tonight.85 min Well, this is horrible. After just 12 minutes on the pitch, Paulo Dybala pulls up and limps off. He has quickly been replaced by 21 year-old Marco Olivieri.81 min It’s hard not to expect another big Ronaldo moment before this is all over. It nearly came after an excellent run from Sandro, who found Rabiot before the ball rolled to Ronaldo. The Portuguese took a couple of touches and then put his foot through the ball, but Anderson came up with a great block to deny him.78 min Drama! A bit of a mess from Szczesny, who flew off his line to punch the ball away and completely missed the ball. As his former Arsenal teammate Ramsey attempted to clear the ball away, the Welshman also clipped Dembele who went down called for a penalty. After a pause for VAR, this one was rightfully not given.76 min Chance! Dybala is already making his mark on his game with some beautiful combination play, instantly speeding up the Juventus passing. After Juventus win a corner, the Argentine then whips the corner in directly onto Ronaldo’s forehead. Surprisingly, Ronaldo sent the free header just over the bar. You really would have expected him to score there.72 min After the second drinks break, Paulo Dybala is finally on. He replaces Bernardeschi. Cuadrado also made way for Danilo.70 min Ronaldo is purring right now. He just made a fool out of Dubois on the left before whipping in an excellent cross to Higuain. Of course, Higuain has been a disaster so far today so he sent the header well over the bar. He really should have hit the target at the very least.66 min A couple of substitutions for the away side. Former Arsenal player Jeff Reine-Adelaide replaces Karl Toko-Ekambi and Moussa Dembele, Lyon’s top goalscorer, finally comes on to replace Memphis Depay.62 min After all of the penalty discussion, there can be no doubt about the skill and conviction behind that strike. Meanwhile, Aaron Ramsey has replaced Pjanic. Juventus will chase after this essential goal and you wonder how long Lyon can keep up with so few games in the team’s legs.Out of nowhere, Ronaldo picks up the ball outside the box and absolutely obliterates a left-footed bullet into the top of the net. Just like that. Of course.57 min It’s Lyon’s time for an excellent spell of possession, also primarily on their left flank. The ball rolls out to young Bruno Guimarães who fires a strike from distance just over the bar.54 min Juventus have started the second half well with ample possession and they are moving the ball at a decent tempo through Lyon’s lines. Alex Sandro has particularly been a good outlet on the left flank. However, this attack comes to nothing as Lopes collects an overhit cross from Cuadrado.52 min Anthony Lopes is having a solid game in goal for Lyon. This time, Pjanic whipped in a free kick from the left flank, which Lopes confidently met with two fists to send it out of danger.50 min A spectacular pass from Cuadrado, who managed was aiming for Sandro on the other flank but his pass evaded the nearest player by about 10 metres and it went out for a throw in. Meanwhile, Aaron Ramsey and Moussa Dembele are both warming up on the sidelines.47 min Ronaldo goes down on the edge of the area, but this time not even he protests. It looks like he picked up the ball and was ready to fire, only for his foot to collide with Caqueret, sending him falling down. 45 min And we are off in the second half. Juventus kick off.“I have to protest both of those penalty decisions. Aouar was already on his way down when Bentancur cleanly took the ball on the ground with his trailing leg in the proper position behind him. Meanwhile, Memphis deserved better with his arm tucked so close to his body. Still 0-0 as I would have called it (as I am sure everyone is dying to know).”Over on BT Sport, Steve Mcmanaman concurs: “I don’t think either is a penalty.” I would not like to be referee Felix Zwayer today...Considering how soft the penalty he conceded was, one would hope and assume that the Lyon captain still retains his status as a hero in the dressing room. “I don’t understand how either penalty decision was given after VAR checks. Surely Bentancur takes the ball comfortably and Memphis barely moved his arm and it certainly wasn’t separated from his body. The handball rule continues to mystify.”Some very big decisions to come for Maurizio Sarri in Turin. The obvious, biggest question of all is when will Paulo Dybala come on? A game of two penalties so far and a pretty good response from Juventus after the early goal.45 min Four minutes of extra time now and we are already halfway through. This game is poised very nicely.45 min Admirably, Lyon have responded to the goal by going back on the attack. Once again, they are finding most of their joy down the left and Houssem Aouar is particularly having a decent game. This time, Lyon win a free kick on the left after a foul on Cornet, but Bonucci clears with a firm header."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0008e5d8ef265237d5073ba653d7edb5a3fad11/249_0_4751_2851/master/4751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e971a63f51ea2918e66f7974d42e631c","title":"nintendo lego childhood","story":"Digital and analogue modes of play combine in a new nostalgia-infused toy collection that will have all generations entrancedIf there are two things that defined my 1990s childhood (apart from Disney) they would be Nintendo and Lego. Like many millennials I have never entirely grown out of either. In a cabinet in my spare room sits a perfect Lego Simpsons house, miniature cityscapes of Berlin and London, and a blocky Mini. As for the video games, well, I’ve turned them into a career I’ve been a games journalist and critic for more than 15 years, and own more Mario games than I’m comfortable admitting.All of which means I am an absolute sucker for the Nintendo-themed Lego sets that came out this month. Aimed at younger Lego fans, the Super Mario sets (a starter set is £49.99, with an eye-wateringly expensive array of expansions, from £3.49 character packs to an £80 Bowser’s Castle) offer bright bricks that can be combined to make real-world Mario levels, and an electronic Mario toy who comes to life to jump around them.These aren’t static bricky recreations like Lego’s Batman or Disney sets they’re more like level design kits. There is more fun to be had after the build than during. Lego Mario is a great toy: he knows when he’s on water (blue), lava (red) or sand (yellow), and little QR-code like patterns tell him when he’s jumping on a Goomba or climbing the flagpole at the end of a level. These Lego sets are playable in a way that others aren’t, with reconfigurable level layouts that allow for the creation of imaginary adventures that sprawl across the living-room floor.At 11 months my youngest is more likely to eat the bricks than admire their ingenious architecture, but a friend’s six- and eight-year-olds were captivated. (Of course they instantly became covetous of the expensive expansions having spent a good 20 minutes browsing haunted Boo houses and Yoshi add-ons on Lego’s website after building the starter set, I could hardly blame them.) With other child-oriented Lego tie-ins – Star Wars or Disney, say – I’ve noticed that the completed builds often gather dust in kids’ rooms. The Mario series’ cute gimmicks offer more encouragement to actually play with it. Nintendo and Lego worked together on these sets, and this is the result of the meeting of two different but compatible philosophies of play: a physical toy with the some of the best properties of video games, choice and interactivity.For adults with no children to use as an excuse to buy Lego, the astoundingly intricate model NES is the more tempting option (if also the vastly more expensive one, at £209.99). The NES was never the cultural phenomenon in the UK that it was in the US but still the sight of its boxy, incontrovertibly 80s form rendered in Lego bricks gives a little aesthetic thrill. It is such an enjoyable model, surprisingly fun to build for what is essentially a collection of grey bricks. The real attraction is the accompanying miniature TV, which – absurdly, enchantingly – features a brick recreation of Super Mario Bros on a rotating screen, like a drive belt or tank tread, operated by a little handle that makes Mario jump and stomp as the pixel-art scenery scrolls by.This larger model sits half-built on my desk at work, because with little kids at home it is certain to get scattered across the room by a flying teddy bear or destructive baby before it reaches completion. I can hardly think of a better example of what Lego now means to different generations. There’s Lego-as-toy for kids, the bright bricks inspiring bizarre and playful creations then Lego-as-architectural-model for adults, who spend quiet hours building blocky recreations of their childhood amusements.These sets have got me thinking about different expressions of play – whether it be quiet hours spent at the kitchen table building a Lego castle or boisterous afternoons cross-legged in front of the TV with my brother, trying to complete Super Mario World together – and the great delight that awaits me in sharing these joyful childhood pleasures with my own children. My three-year-old son is delighted by Lego Mario, cackling at the little figure’s yelps of embarrassment when he pulls off his dungarees, insisting one evening he join us for dinner, a plate of bricks before Mario’s squat little body.Right now I build for him and he plays or directs, splicing structures together with no regard for my precise constructions of the levels and towers on the box. I look forward to seeing him build Lego structures by himself, and to witnessing his first steps into the Mario video game worlds that ignited my imagination as a child."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00611d3d6bf6e33edc8b4f90d02dcad8897980de/0_217_3135_1880/master/3135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8d797b09e102df25393ef4e1735326e","title":"covid led to brutal crackdown on garment workers rights says report","story":"Brands including Primark, Zara and H\u0026ampM accused of failing to protect workers at factories in Asia from ‘union busting’Some of Europe’s biggest retailers, including Primark, Zara and H\u0026ampM, are failing to stop Covid-19 being used as a pretext for union busting, human rights activists are warning.Millions of garment workers in some of the poorest parts of Asia have lost their jobs since coronavirus shutdowns hit the retail industry worldwide.The report highlights nearly 5,000 job losses it argues are linked to union membership at nine factories in Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangladesh and India. Workers say they have been disproportionately targeted due to union membership and organising.Thulsi Narayanasamy, senior labour rights lead at BHRRC, said: “Workers face a brutal crackdown when exercising their most fundamental rights, and brands aren’t stepping up enough to ensure workers in their supply chains are protected.“Threatening the right to organise collectively and be part of a trade union at such a critical time … stops them from being able to ensure they are paid wages, are safe at work and free from harassment.”Among the cases mentioned in the report are a supplier in India making clothes for H\u0026ampM that sacked 1,200 workers in June citing lack of orders because of Covid-19. Meanwhile, the supplier’s other factories remained open. Workers and unions claim the closed factory was the supplier’s only one with a union, and was targeted for this reason.As production slowed in the garment sector in Asia as a result of plummeting sales caused by the pandemic, factories began to make thousands of workers redundant across the region.By early April, in Bangladesh a million garment workers had been sent home without pay or had lost their jobs after western clothing brands cancelled or suspended £2.4bn of existing orders.But activists have warned that redundancies were being used to target union members and leaders.The report looks in detail at several ongoing disputes between unionised workers and managers in factories in India, Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangladesh and India. In every case it is alleged that big name brands should have been more active in ensuring workers were not punished or targeted for being union members.Three factories owned by the Windy Group in Bangladesh, which supplies Inditex – the Spanish owner of Zara – and H\u0026ampM, sacked 3,000 workers. The workers say the dismissals are linked to union activism, although in a statement H\u0026ampM told the  that agreements had been reached at two of the factories. “As always, we work to facilitate a dialogue between the parties to help them resolve the conflict peacefully,” it said.In Cambodia, a young female worker, Soy Sros, was jailed for 55 days over a Facebook post criticising the factory’s plans to sack union members.In Myanmar, 107 garment workers making clothes for Inditex, Primark and US chain Bestseller were sacked three days after they registered a new union.A worker called Thitsar at the Huabo Times factory told the  in June that a few weeks after the sackings, workers from another factory were transferred over to fill the gap. Primark said it worked to resolve the dispute. “In collaboration with other brands, Primark’s investigation into code violation allegations at the Huabo Times factory has resulted in constructive cooperation between all parties. An agreement has now been reached between the factory and the union, which will see the reinstatement of the workers involved, with compensation in full for lost earnings.”This week Primark said it would pay its suppliers in full for all outstanding finished garments.Inditex is linked in the report to four disputes, three of which have been resolved through negotiations. A spokesperson said: “As the BHRRC points out, in each dispute where we are a customer of the factory concerned, we have engaged with owners and workers’ representatives to drive social dialogue towards a resolution. Respect for freedom of association is a key principle of Inditex’s code of conduct. ”Several of the companies named in the report, including Primark, Levi Strauss, Inditex, H\u0026ampM and Mango, all stressed in responses to the BHRCC and the  that they are committed to protecting workers’ rights to join and form unions and bargain collectively.The cases highlighted in the report are, activists say, the tip of the iceberg. spoke to a worker in a Yangon factory that makes clothes for Primark who fears he was violently attacked because of his union role.Soe Min Thu believes bosses at the Amber Stone factory in Yangon where he works hired men to attack him as part of an “aggressive, illegal” campaign to stop workers organising for better conditions.Soe Min Thu said he was hospitalised for two days in June when four masked men attacked him with knives and clubs after he left work.“We do not like you much in the factory, we’ve been watching you,” he recalled them saying. “If you keep working with the union … then next time you’ll die.” He was left with his arm in a cast and gashes on his head and leg.On the day he was beaten, Soe Min Thu said a group of men came to the factory and supervisors pointed out union leaders to them. He claims the factory had hired guards to monitor him and other senior union members during working hours since they formed the union in April.Shortly before the attack, the factory fired 29 union members after a heated dispute between workers and a supervisor, who was also fired.Zin Mar Htay, one of the sacked workers, told the  that before she was fired she worked six days a week and earned the equivalent of £107 a month, £127 if she worked overtime.She said factory supervisors were abusive, calling female workers “whores”. Other workers allege that fire safety is lax at the factory. Amber Stone’s owner, Zhang Zuwei, strongly denied hiring men to attack Soe Min Thu and refutes all the allegations. She denied supervisors were abusive or that she had hired men to intimidate union members in the factory. The sackings, she added, were not “an action targeting the union” but because of an altercation on the premises between workers. She said the case would be settled though formal arbitration.Soe Min Thu has reported his attackers to the police, but says he doubts they will be caught. The attack will not stop him working with the union at the factory, he said. “We are doing the right thing.”Primark said it was shocked by the alleged assault and “firmly condemned such practices”. It said it had “engaged directly with the union, and has held a constructive meeting with them to discuss their concerns”.“We are working towards a further meeting between Primark, its supplier, the factory and the unions.”Primark said the factory passed a fire safety inspection during an audit in September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecd53daab67e29cad8d74850779d20c5c6446366/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0294c3f709b931ebdda4817cceac1785","title":"cleaning may bore me the result a feeling i love","story":"For years I used to rubbish the idea of tidying up, but there’s more than a crumb of comfort in a Dorito-free sofaThere are many variations of the maxim “tidy desk, tidy mind”. And, though I am somewhat bastardising Newton’s third law of motion here, an untidy desk should therefore accompany an untidy mind. While I am not sure of the causal relationship, I definitely have both of those.I used to kick the idea of tidying under the bed shove it to the back of the wardrobe. Shunt it into another room. Throw a blanket over it. But if I am not reformed, then I am reforming. Because I have learned that a clean and tidy home is one of the most happy-making things. It is still pleasing if someone else is responsible (a professional cleaner, a partner, etc), but actually doing the graft and then living with, in the best sense, the result is a feeling I love. I feel genuine pride when a drawer can slide smoothly into my desk rather than jamming, overstuffed with papers. Or when I know I am sitting on my sofa, minus 9,000 receipts and corners of Doritos between the cushions.I don’t understand how cleaning has become a popular genre on Instagram, but I have watched certain stain-removal tutorials on YouTube. There are entire forums full of tricks on how to clean windows without streaks, passed down through generations.I still find cleaning dull, but once I get into it, at least I am fully focused on how fragrant the finish will be. Shakespeare was correct: all that glisters is not gold. But I’m content if it’s just my chrome tap.And the process itself does have some advantages: doing things with one’s hands is a great distraction from, well, literally everything.

The first few are really just introductions to a plane and cockpit, a run-through of the basics you’re taken up and brought back down. I hadn’t spent more than 10 minutes in control of an aircraft, and my instructor was sitting next to me, carefully watching my every move.At 4pm on 31 August 2019, I settled in to the two-seat Cessna 152 for my next lesson 30 minutes later, we started to make our way back to Jandakot airport, Perth. As we cruised at 3,500ft, I noticed my instructor was staring out the window into the sky above us. I assumed he’d seen something, but there was nothing there. Then he started to shake. I’d never seen someone have a seizure, but it was clear that was what was happening.At that moment, thankfully, I was in control of the aircraft. If I hadn’t been, we may have started plummeting before I’d clocked what was going on. Instead, I ensured we were stable and then went into survival mode: we needed to make it down alive. First I decided to phone my wife. I explained what was happening, but then my phone cut out. I can only presume she thought that I’d died.Once I’d figured out how to work the radio, I contacted air traffic control: “Emergency, emergency, emergency”, and told them who I was. The man at the end of the radio reassured me, confirmed there was no traffic, and that I should ert towards the airport urgently. He calmly talked me through every step as I began to fly us back.“I hope they don’t think I’m paying for this class,” I found myself saying to the controller, cracking a joke in order to bring back my focus. The severity of the situation began to dawn on me: the flashing lights of emergency service vehicles streaming towards the runway made me realise people were preparing for disaster. By now it was the evening, and soon we’d start losing light.I was talked through a few practice landings. I’d fly us down towards the runway to get used to the experience, before pulling back to ascend into the air once again. Meanwhile, in a state of confusion, my instructor began to regain consciousness. Oblivious to what was happening, he started to press buttons and touch dials on the radio, refusing to listen to my objections. That was all I needed, I thought.Only 40 or 50 minutes after my first contact with the control room, the voice in my ear asked if I thought I was ready to try landing. Attempt number five would be the one. As we descended, my mind ran wild: one moment I was thinking that landing so early in my flying career would be proof of my abilities. The next I imagined us coming down on a highway, ending up on fire or upside down. Focus, Max, I told myself. Then I heard the wheels hit the ground.I taxied towards the terminal. The controllers presumed I’d stop on the runway, but this felt easy compared with what had just happened – I wanted to see the journey through to the end. Once at a standstill, though, my legs turned to jelly. It was 6pm by the time the ground team helped me step out.Words can’t describe how it felt to hug my wife and grab my three children when I made it to where they stood waiting: we’d both been terrified the kids would lose their father – not that my wife let on to them what was going on. My instructor was taken to hospital it turned out he had a brain tumour. Somehow, I’d managed to save both our lives.Only a week or two later I was back in the cockpit I didn’t quit my job in engineering to just give up on my plans to be a pilot. Now I’m making good progress on the 150 hours’ flight time I need to attempt my commercial licence qualification. Some people have said I should have been rewarded with more than an extra 45 minutes of experience added to my timesheet, but frankly, I am just happy to be alive. • As told to Michael SegalovDo you have an experience to share?

The officials, who are not named, were uncooperative and refused to allocate resources to winnable target seats, the submission said.Given Labour’s narrow loss in 2017, they argued: “It’s not impossible that Jeremy Corbyn might now be in his third year as a Labour prime minister were it not for the unauthorised, unilateral action taken by a handful of senior party officials.”The narrative is vehemently opposed by the officials concerned, one of whom called it “a mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory to absolve themselves”, adding that all spending was legitimate, declared and accounted for.The row erupted when the 860-page internal party report, authored anonymously, was leaked to the media in April, shortly after Keir Starmer took over from Corbyn.It claimed that as well as undermining the 2017 election, internal opponents of Corbyn hampered efforts to tackle antisemitism within Labour, and it quoted WhatsApp messages from party officials insulting his allies, some with apparently racist or sexist overtones.Starmer set up the inquiry under lawyer Martin Forde QC. It had a deadline of Friday for accepting initial evidence.Corbyn’s claims, seen by the , are made jointly with Labour’s 2017 election committee, also comprising McDonnell, the former shadow ministers Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, and five senior aides to Corbyn at the time: Karie Murphy, Seumas Milne, Andrew Fisher, Andrew Murray and Steve Howell.The claim that hostile Labour officials jeopardised the 2017 election campaign has caused fury among Corbyn’s supporters. His joint submission said: “We believe that there is clear evidence of factional activity by senior paid employees of the party against the elected leadership of the time.”They allege that in 2017 hostile officials set up a “shadow operation” in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course, which included starving potential target seats of money and focusing resources on MPs not allied to Corbyn.If claims in the report of significant sums of money being spent on such actions without authority are correct, then the inquiry must consider “whether it may have constituted fraudulent activity”, the submission said.More generally, the joint statement condemns what it calls a “toxic culture” at Labour headquarters, saying this is demonstrated by the WhatsApp messages.One of the officials blamed by Corbyn told the  the submission was not true. “The leaked report contains no evidence that party staff did not try and do the best they could to win the 2017 election. Not one piece of actual evidence,” the official said.“Pro-Corbyn staff inspected tens of thousands of former staff emails in January 2020 to try and find evidence of their ridiculous conspiracy theory. They found nothing because it is not real. They are trying to build a mythical ‘stab in the back’ conspiracy theory to absolve themselves of the consequences of their incompetence.”In contrast, the official said, there were emails showing Corbyn’s team tried to push election resources in 2017 towards protecting loyalist MPs in safe seats, at the expense of marginal constituencies. has separately seen the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage. They allege that the leaked report misused their WhatsApp messages to falsely make them seem racist and sexist, and confirm they are suing Labour for data protection breaches and libel over the document.Mark Lewis of Patron Law, who is representing some of the Labour officials, said: “It would not be appropriate to make comment at this stage. The matters are before the Forde inquiry and will be the subject of litigation.”The Corbyn document also talks about a general “daily hostility and obstruction” by officials towards the then leader and his team.In a separate submission to the inquiry, a former Labour press officer and adviser to McDonnell made similar allegations. Joe Ryle said he witnessed a “constant battle” with Labour HQ over appointing staff, and routine briefings to the media against Corbyn. In his submission, also seen by the , Ryle wrote: “Work colleagues of mine would regularly turn up to meetings with party staff and by the time they got back to their desks the contents of the meeting had already been leaked to journalists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bddc81fba0a38806422cf7e95f07b1e99e8e2fa6/0_172_5201_3123/master/5201.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=feef0086c9caead08913837c46467fa9","title":"tell us how have uk childrens services been during the pandemic","story":"There have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown across the countryThere have been fears around the wellbeing of vulnerable children throughout the coronavirus lockdown in the UK, with schools, GPs and other settings where they might be referred to other services largely closed.The mental health charity Mind has said that referrals to children’s mental health services have gone down significantly during lockdown, meaning treatment providers could face a significant backlog.

After three days of captivating cricket Pakistan are the favourites to win the match. They lead by 244 and have two wickets remaining all their batsmen have gone. Even if the last two were dismissed immediately on Saturday morning England would be faced with a formidable target on a surface that is becoming increasingly dry and unreliable.But if just two England batsmen could cobble together significant scores then an amazing heist remains possible. Pakistan have dominated nearly all of the past three days yet in a bizarre final session England, who were far from flawless out there, contrived to take seven wickets. And the game is still alive. As is Ben Stokes, who did his utmost to deliver his Lazarus impressions by snatching the ball late in the day and taking two wickets. Whether that affects his fitness for the next Test remains to be seen.There were other moments of mystification. Chris Woakes was England’s most potent-looking bowler and took two wickets yet bowled only five overs in Pakistan’s second innings. Dom Bess struggled to find a consistent length yet Joe Root kept the faith for a remarkably long time. Unusually Jimmy Anderson was below his best in his second spell.But such queries can wait until the end of the match they may evaporate if England somehow knock off the runs. One certainty is that Stokes is more likely to bat well in the second innings because he is an all-action cricketer and he has been in the game even if he was hobbling at the end of a long day.Pakistan’s faltering progress in their second innings, despite the comforting ballast that stems from a three figure lead, highlighted the difficulties of batting on a deteriorating surface even though England did not help themselves. Stokes, stationed too close to Root, dropped a relatively straightforward catch off Anderson, who kicked the turf with a venom not seen since the halcyon days of Angus Fraser. Yet the wickets kept coming. Shan Masood, the heroic centurion of the first innings, failed to score after edging down the legside off Stuart Broad.Abid Ali, who had benefited from the Stokes drop, holed out in Bess’s first over. Then Woakes intervened with the vital wicket of Babar Azam, caught by Stokes and then striking the front pad of Azhar Ali, which produced an unreviewable lbw. A partnership of 38 between Asad Shafiq and Mohammad Rizwan was tilting the balance further in Pakistan’s direction when Dominic Sibley made his first impression on the game. The batsmen hesitated over a single and the new sleek Sibley swooped and hit the stumps with Shafiq almost out of the picture. Stokes was resurrected to take two wickets, Broad removed Shadab and the final-innings equation was almost complete.Given that England were 12 for 3 inside six overs in their first innings a total of 219 could have been much worse. In the morning session the ball beat the bat so frequently that it was a minor miracle that they had lost only one wicket by lunch after resuming on 92 for 4. In the first hour the total advanced by 19 runs and eight of those were byes. The Pakistan pacemen were on target. Jos Buttler managed one scoring shot. Even the busy Ollie Pope was becalmed. It sounds dull it was actually riveting. Pope posted an invaluable half-century and then there was no disgrace in his departure. A delivery from Naseem Shah jumped, took the edge of his bat and terminated in the hands of Shadab in the gully.Out came Woakes, not the reassuring sight that it once was since he had only scored more than six once in his previous nine Test innings. He ducked into his third delivery from Naseem and the ball sped to midwicket off his helmet. Yet he soon reached double figures with pleasant drives off the pacemen and by lunch England had scraped to 159 for 5.However the innings subsided after the break and the architect of England’s demise were the wrist spinners. Until this point Yasir Shah had been unreliable but that all changed after his second ball of the afternoon. The first, bowled to Buttler, was left as it spun a long way from outside the off stump the second had a peculiarly devious quality: it was straight. Buttler pushed forward with a barely discernible gap between bat and pad and the ball passed through it to clip his off-stump.Now Yasir was transformed he was relaxed yet still feverish for the fray and he began to hit his length far more frequently. Bess pushed forward and the ball turned and bounced before brushing his glove and being nimbly caught by a ing Shafiq at slip. Then Woakes was bowled for 19 by a quicker top-spinner, which he was trying to pull.Stuart Broad threatened another technicolour counterattack and he ended up unbeaten on 29 after playing some bold strokes but this time he could not impart significant damage. He took three boundaries in an over against Afridi, two of which came from the middle of the bat this prompted Azhar Ali to remove Afridi after one over and turn to his second leg-spinner, Shadab. There were some high jinx but Shadab soon ended up with two wickets as Pakistan ended up with a significant lead. How significant we discover on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e11c35e2c1b7be46c41fb50d56d55b7c1261a03/967_1000_4081_2448/master/4081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0aa76310efb71f6e1ee2326ab266705","title":"womens cricket world cup pushed back to 2022 due to covid 19 pandemic","story":"The Covid-19 pandemic continues to damage the cricket calendar with the 2021 Women’s World Cup now pushed back to 2022 and the five-Test series for England’s men in India next January now expected to shrink in length.The International Cricket Council announced on Friday that the 50-over women’s tournament, due to be hosted by New Zealand in February, faces a 12-month delay despite hopes of it taking place as planned being raised by the organisers advertising for a “biosecurity manager” last week.Only five teams are confirmed to compete in the competition – New Zealand, Australia, England, India and South Africa – with three more spots needing to be decided by a qualifying tournament that was due to take place in Sri Lanka last month, only for the pandemic to force its postponement.The need to get the qualifier played next year, and give all eight teams sufficient cricket in the lead-up to the main event, has been cited as the reason for the 12-month delay, along with “the health and safety of everyone involved”. But the decision raises questions about the ICC’s priorities, given a men’s event in India will now come first, despite two million Covid‑19 cases in the country to date, yet New Zealand (which has had 1,569 cases) and the women must wait their turn.It also means 2022 will become a year of three global competitions for the women’s game, with a T20 World Cup also due to take place as well as a short-form tournament during the summer’s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.The global governing body has also stated that the men’s T20 World Cup in 2021 will take place in India, as planned, with Australia, originally due to stage this year’s edition, now hit with a 24-month delay and hosting in 2022.It is a blow for Cricket Australia and one that may lead to redundancies among the organising committee that had been working towards the original start date this October. With the Indian Premier League having moved into the vacated slot, but being played in the United Arab Emirates, eyebrows have been raised here, too.The IPL’s move has also put paid to the notion of England’s white-ball team touring India before Christmas, with the England and Wales Cricket Board confirming on Friday that this will now take place following the Test series in the new year.As things stand England are due to play five Tests against India but the additional white-ball games – originally due to be three ODIs and three Twenty20s – are expected to see this come down to four or possibly just three Tests, with the UAE a mooted host.It leaves England’s men with just a brief white-ball tour of South Africa in December before Christmas. The Test team are then expected to play a two-match series in Sri Lanka in January – the tour that was called off in March this year – before bouncing on to face India."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49231f67e7b37b6b9065227e1126458c6fc7c2f5/0_188_4661_2798/master/4661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c7cf136a0ad56611c833f3501434fae","title":"us pga championship 2020 second round live","story":"Birdie at 4 for one of the USA’s great young hopes Collin Morikawa. Having shot 69 yesterday, he rises to -2. “Dearest Scott,” begins Mac Millings. “Did you really (8.32pm) only have bread and water? Wot no Hamburger Helper?” Thing is, I’ve only got one box of Helper left. You can only fit so many into a suitcase when coming back from a Stateside trip, unless you throw away all your clothes, which believe me I’ve considered. So I’m saving it for a special occasion. Thanksgiving, perhaps. Christmas Day, maybe. Or most likely Sunday at the Masters. Raise a glass for me the next time you’re shovelling some down, will you.Li most certainly will not be taking the 36-hole lead for granted. Holding onto it looks unlikely right now, because it’s back-to-back birdies for Jason Day, who clips his second at 5 to six feet and tidies up with businesslike briskness. He strides off with great purpose. The 2015 champion, back in form after a long dip, appears to be in the mood to make up for lost time.Birdie for Xander Schauffele at 4, his first of the day. The young Californian with a wonderful record in the majors already - six top-ten finishes in his first 11 starts - moves to -5. A bit of a group of afternoon starters forming near the top of the leaderboard, waiting to pounce. Li Haotong won’t be taking the 36-hole lead for granted.Some belated news of Rickie Fowler, who for a wee while looked to have revived his title bid. Sadly he hacked his way up 6 en route to a double bogey. Another dropped shot at 8 meant he finished with a 69, not a disaster in and of itself but no good when coupled with yesterday’s 73. He’s +2 and may well be going home later tonight. An ideal start for McIlroy, who knocks in his birdie putt to immediately move into credit at -1. Neither Woods nor Thomas can guide their efforts in, and they remain at -2 and +1 respectively.Kim Si-woo already has the unofficial fifth major, the Players Championship, under his belt. He won that back in 2017 as a 21-year-old, becoming the championship’s youngest-ever winner. He’s just completed his second round, playing the front nine in 33 to sign for a 68. Filed alongside yesterday’s 69, the 25-year-old South Korean is in good nick at -3 going into the weekend.Jason Day opens his second-round birdie account on the par-five 4th, stroking in a 15-foot putt. He’s now in a share of second with Tommy Fleetwood at -6. Meanwhile back on 1, Thomas, Woods and McIlroy pepper the flag with their approaches. Thomas is a little unlucky to see his ball bounce off at an odd angle to snag in the fringe, but he’s not far from the hole and he’ll have a good chip-in chance.Woods is playing with Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas. McIlroy’s opening 70 could have been a hell of a lot worse, especially after that 5-5-5 run of bogeys early in the round. But he’s still very much in with a shout if he can conjure something up today. The opening drive is larruped down the track. Thomas, winner of the WGC St Jude last weekend and the new world number one, makes it three out of three, and he’ll be hoping to recover from yesterday’s post-victory hangover round of 71.Tony Finau, having birdied the opening hole, knocks his third at the par-five 4th to a couple of feet. In goes the putt, and he’s started fast, rising in short order to -5. Meanwhile back on the 1st tee, news of another relatively well known big hitter: it’s Tiger! Yesterday’s 68 was his lowest round in a major since 2012, and he looks in the mood again today, clipping his tee shot straight down the middle, not even bothering to look where it ended up. He knew alright.Scottie Scheffler dropped a stroke at the opening hole, but he’s bounced back to -4 with birdie at 5. The 2010 champ Martin Kaymer couldn’t recover from his errant opening tee shot, dropping a stroke at 1 he’s since parred 2 and 3 to remain at -3.A par at 9 for Paul Casey, and he signs for an excellent 67. He goes into the weekend at -5, currently tied third. Birdie for Daniel Berger at 2 he’s -4. A steady start for Jason Day: three pars. And back on 1, after Gary Woodland makes his par to remain at -3, Lowry knocks in his short birdie putt, and Koepka follows him again. They’re -3 and -5 respectively.The Open champ Shane Lowry smashes his opening drive 325 yards down the 1st. A gentle wedge to six feet. The defending PGA champion Brooks Koepka matches his first two shots. Big birdie chances for both players coming up. A disappointing end to Bryson DeChambeau’s round. Bogey on 9 and he’ll have to make do with a level-par 70. Back in 37, it’s a round that offered more. He’s -2. Elsewhere, for the second day running, Brendon Todd knocks in a missable par putt on the final green, this time the 18th, and he signs for a 70 to go with yesterday’s 65. He remains at -5.It’s a 69 for Jon Rahm too. He’s been patchy as hell so far this week, never able to get any real momentum going, but he’ll be here for Moving Day for sure. A 69 today to follow yesterday’s 70. He’s -1.Thanks Tom. Back just in time to see Lefty ... possibly ... save himself from the cut. Bogeys at 6 and 8 looked to have cooked his goose, but a tramliner on the last for an absurd birdie means he’s signing for a 69 and he ends the day at +1. That’s one shot too many at the minute ... but there’s plenty of time for the picture to change.Cameron Champ isn’t far off a birdie at 18 but a par score keeps him right in contention and in the groove, matching Fleetwood’s 64. Back at the 1st, Jason Day, who put himself nicely among the leading pack yesterday, underhits his birdie putt but gets his par. And with that I’ll hand you back to a well-nourished Scott. Bye.Tommy Fleetwood signs for a stunning second-round 64, which is still the best round of the event so far, though Champ could yet match it. Fleetwood is looking mighty composed for a man who’s not played much competitive golf in recent months. And he’s just shared his thoughts on Sky. “The conditions were easier to start with today, yesterday I had a bad couple of holes on 12 and 13 and that halted progress but today I got all my shots away, I hit a lot of fairways and that clearly makes it easier. I’ve learnt a lot from going away and coming back and you don’t realise how sharp you are sometimes when you’re playing 30 times a year. I’m not gonna say I’m playing the best I’ve ever played or am the sharpest I’ve ever been but it’s coming back.”Fleetwood pushes his birdie putt on the 9th just too far to the left – and misses a chance for the outright lowest round of the week so far. Fowler, at the ninth and two over, needs a birdie and gives himself a chance with a clean straight drive from the tee. Back at the start, Kaymer hacks his first tee shot too far out wide – an inauspicious start for the 2010 champion who was in good nick yesterday.Ouch. Casey sends a presentable birdie just wide of the flag on the sixth – he knows he should have done better with that, while Cameron Champ records back to birdies to move onto five-under overall with two holes to play. One to watch on moving day. Inevitably, attention is on Tiger who’s just strode out to the practice area – he’s due out in about an hour.Fleetwood deftly chips from some tricky thicker stuff onto the green to stay on course for par, which he makes, while De Chambeau, facing a tricky approach betwixt bunkers to the green on the 7th, chips a tremendous shot to the foot of the green and puts himself within reach of the pin before sending a flawless uphill putt into the hole for birdie.Thanks Scott. Eveningafternoon everyone. And I join you as Rickie Fowler delicately has to remove a bee from his ball and after that display of respect for his natural surroundings sends his second shot on the 7th to the edge of the green. The on-song Fleetwood, on the par-three 8th, pushes his first drive slightly out left but should be good for par at least.A second bogey in four holes for DeChambeau, the result of hoicking a drive towards the trees again. He’s back where he started the day at -2. Meanwhile Fleetwood sends his drive to the side of the short par-four 7th. A chip and a putt, and he’s two off the lead!And with that, I’m off for a delicious repast of bread and water. While I’m munching down that treat, Tom Davies will show you the way. See you in an hour!Harold Varner III, in the final pairing on Sunday at Bethpage Black last year, may have another PGA tilt in mind. He was going nowhere in particular, +2 overall through 13 today. But he’s just finished with four birdies in the last five holes, the last thanks to a 25-footer on 18, and he’s signing for a 66. He’s -2, and after yesterday’s average 72, right back in this!Todd gives himself a great chance of escaping from 13 with par, sending a wedge from 100 yards over the flag and spinning back to ten feet. That’s a marvellous effort. But he stabs with uncharacteristic uncertainty at the par saver, and it’s a bogey that topples him back to -4. Meanwhile on 6, Fleetwood takes two putts from 70 feet for his par. He stays at -5. And word of Rickie Fowler, who is playing with DeChambeau and was faffing around in the trees at the same time. Having left his drive up against the base of a trunk, he was forced to bash back out onto the fairway, but only managed it after hitting the trunk with his backswing. A fortunate one, or great improvisation on the downswing, take your pick. He escaped with par, anyway, and remains at -1.DeChambeau lashes his drive up a tree at 5. For a second, it doesn’t look as though the ball’s going to drop. But fall it does, and he manages to scramble his par, though he requires a nerveless 12-footer to make it. He stays at -3. Meanwhile up on 13, Todd flays his drive into thick oomska down the left, and is only able to hack back out on the fairway. He’ll require an up-and-down from distance to save his par.Lanto Griffin also reaches the clubhouse in high spirits. He’s signing for his second 68 of the week, and will go into Moving Day nicely placed at -4. More putting woes for Patrick Reed, meanwhile, as a short birdie effort lips out on 7. He remains at -3, and has the fume on.Todd tidies up without fuss or nerves. He’ll take some beating this week if he keeps putting like this. Two putts from 70 feet was hardly a shoo-in. He remains at -5. Meanwhile Li’s outside chance of a birdie on 18 slides by the left of the cup and he’ll happily take a par that seals a superb 65. He’ll go into the weekend in fine fettle he may well be still leading if nobody in the afternoon launches a charge. Brilliant from the young Chinese star!Another birdie for Cameron Champ, who continues to barge his way up the leaderboard. This one comes at 12, and he’s -3 overall. Brendon Todd only just gets onto the front of the long par-four 12th, and leaves himself a 70-foot two-putt for par. The first stops three feet wide right, and will be a knee-knocker. And on 18, Li whips his approach over the flag and onto the top tier of the green, from where he’ll have an outside chance of birdie from 20 feet.Li appears happy to keep hold of what he’s got. His tee shot at 17 safely finds the heart of the green, but a good 30 feet from the flag. He bundles the putt up to kick-in distance, and remains three clear at -8. Meanwhile DeChambeau makes par at the long par-five 4th, and looks slightly disappointed, having belted his drive into deep filth, a shot that nixed his birdie bid from the get-go. He stays at -3. And a clumsy three-putt bogey for Reed on 6. He drops back to -3.Todd sends his tee shot at 11 over the back of the green. His chip is heavy handed, and he’s left with a tricky five-footer coming back. You’ve seen these missed. But he tidies up to save his par. He’s made a couple of those shaky ones this week, not least on the 9th last night, when it would have been so easy to shed a shot from 12 feet. Precious putts, and he remains at -5 ... alongside Fleetwood, who bounces back from his bogey at 2 with birdie at 4!The leader Li sends his tee shot at the short par-four 16th into thick nonsense down the right. But he wedges from 80 yards to 15 feet, and nearly curls in the putt. However the birdies seem to have dried up. Just a par, though that’s his sixth in a row, and there’s still no blemish on his card today. He’ll take two more for a 65 to go alongside his opening round of 67.Paul Casey rolls in a 35-foot birdie putt on 1 to grab a share of second place. He’s -5, alongside Brendon Todd, who makes a slightly disappointing par on the inviting par-five 10th, the result of pulling his second, a hybrid, into thick stuff down the left. That’s almost like giving a shot to the field. Who’s this coming up quietly on the rail? Why it’s 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed, who shot a relatively uneventful 68 yesterday, and is on track to post something similar today. Having played the back nine in 34, he’s just birdied 4 to move menacingly to -4. He doesn’t seem to be using up too much emotional energy, certainly when compared with the more knockabout rounds being put together by your Fleetwoods and DeChambeaus. That might stand him in good stead come the weekend, when the ability to dig deep comes at a premium.A wild tee shot down the left of 6 costs Griffin a shot. He slips out of a share of second, back to -4. Meanwhile huge-hitting US youngster Cameron Champ, having played the front nine in 33 strokes, birdies 10 to move to -2 overall. Champ is second on the list for driving distance this season, trailing only a certain Bryson DeChambeau. No wonder the two are doing so well, on a course that, despite its tight nature, seems to be fertile ground for the big boomers.Apologies to Tommy Fleetwood for mentioning the dream of a major-championship 61. Fate having been thus tempted, he drops a stroke at 2, the result of leaving his second stroke short of the green. He slips back to -4. That’s his first bogey of the day. Bah. Li Haotong avoids that particular fate by getting up and down from greenside rough at 15. He’d been in trouble after playing it safe off the tee with an iron, only to find a fairway bunker. A delicate bump and run from 50 feet, followed by a staunch four-foot putt, saved his par."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3a290435a8d9302bb464092108253b162cf21b9/0_49_2382_1428/master/2382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d25f6e4c5aa956e44d3530aa21ef707","title":"anne teresa de keersmaeker review hoppla achterland mitten belgian choreographer","story":"In Hoppla!, Achterland and Mitten, the Belgian dance legend manages a dynamic mix of composition and choreographyThe Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker has always been engrossed by music. Rather than “set” dance to music, she es into the intersections and crosscurrents between the two arts, particularly as forms of composition. Indeed, she calls some of her pieces “dance concerts”, with live musicians integrated into the mise-en-scène, and often into the action itself.You could call the screen adaptations Hoppla! and Achterland “film dance concerts”, since they pay as much attention to filmic composition as to dance and music. Take the opening frame of Hoppla! (1989), with its dead-centre symmetry: a man bisects the screen, two grand pianos face each other behind him, Rorschach blots against the geometry of window frames and floor tiles. A woman enters and stakes her place up centre.This “affrontery”, as it were, triggers the choreography: a suite of dances in which the two constantly upstage, chase, sidestep and circle each other, using a limited palette of hops, swivels, bounces and yanks. He is beanpole tall, she elfin slight, and just like Bartók’s Mikrokosmos, motoring away on the pianos, the dance feels both compositionally coherent and tonally clashing.For the second piece in the film, the camera pans round to reveal two quartets: four dancers, all women, and four string players. Again the music is Bartók, and again, it underpins a suite of dances built from taut formations and clear elements: slides, whipped spins, tiptoe runs. The gestural action suggests a particular image of femininity – as assertive as the booted squadrons the women form, at the same time as it indulges in slinky walks and schoolgirlish hopscotch.Made in De Keersmaeker’s early years, the pieces in Hoppla! form a kind of primer for later dance concerts. A turning point was Achterland (1990), with a monochrome film version made in 1994. Where the Bartók pieces are studious – they are both compositional studies and studio works – Achterland is far more expansive, its musical source is more staged than studied. The set is wide open, with moveable platforms and chairs. The musicians – a violinist playing Ysaÿe, a pianist playing Ligeti – are cued into the action, and De Keersmaeker gives much freer rein to the action even as she keeps the phrasing taut.In fact, Achterland feels like two dance suites – one for three men, another for five women – that first intersect and finally mesh. The men keep hurtling by like passing skateboarders, while the women run the gamut from turbulence to quiet introspection, skittishness and power-dressing. A whole set of moves derives from the strictures of skirts and high heels, even when the dancers are not actually wearing them. Most striking, for both sexes, is the intense dynamism of the floorwork: headlong tumbles, vertiginous es and plunges. All of this is tautly composed, with the musicians prominent and the mobile camera as choreographed as the choreography itself.The camera is far more self-effacing in Mitten, a backstage documentary about one of De Keersmaeker’s most recent dance concerts, Mitten Wir im Leben SindBach6Cellosuiten (2017). This is not a “film dance concert” but a film – a beautifully crafted, if more televisually conventional portrait of the musician, dancers and choreographer as they rehearse for a premiere. After Hoppla! and Achterland, I hankered for more on the artwork, less on the artists at work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de2adfbc5865d6528791ef36b645d22b845b2ba/0_488_5642_3385/master/5642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b4244fdf6395b75a08721313b66331b","title":"itvs im a celebrity to swap australian bush for british castle","story":"Makers promise ‘same tone and feel’ in 20th series despite enforced change of locationThe 20th series of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! will take place not in the Australian bush but in a castle in the UK.The ITV reality contest, launched in 2002 and filmed near the Queensland border with New South Wales since 2003, is staying closer to home this year owing to the coronavirus pandemic.Richard Cowles, the head of entertainment at ITV Studios, said: “We pulled out all the stops to try to make the series happen in Australia. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic and despite us looking at many different contingencies, it became apparent that it just wasn’t possible for us to travel and make the show there.“However, we are all really excited about a UK version of I’m a Celebrity. While it will certainly be different producing the show from the UK, the same tone and feel will remain. Our celebrities will probably have to swap shorts for thermals but they can still look forward to a basic diet of rice and beans and plenty of thrills and surprises along the way.”ITV’s director of television, Kevin Lygo, said: “We announced last week that we were doing all we could to make the series and I’m thrilled that we can bring the show to viewers, albeit not in the jungle. We have a great team both on and off screen and I know they will produce a hugely entertaining series.”Hosted by Ant and Dec, the series usually airs in November for three weeks. The most recent series was won by the former EastEnders actor Jacqueline Jossa, and other previous winners include Kerry Katona, Tony Blackburn and Harry Redknapp.The exact location for this year’s show is yet to be revealed.Another ITV hit, Love Island, was cancelled owing to logistical issues, with Lygo also questioning whether it was appropriate to air a show with contestants “slavering over each other while the rest of world has been told not to go near anyone in the park”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2126bcb0a3a8539b54c50dba76bf19162639c443/0_116_3530_2117/master/3530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b8beed353e8004bc6fba5397014ab51","title":"karen bass joe biden vp california congresswoman","story":"The Los Angeles representative, a top contender to be Biden’s running mate, is respected by both Democratic and Republican colleaguesIn Karen Bass’s home state, colleagues across the political spectrum sing her praises.Most of America is just getting to know the 66-year-old congresswoman from Los Angeles who in recent weeks emerged as a top contender to be Joe Biden’s vice-presidential running mate. But in California, Bass has built a reputation as a progressive and a pragmatist – a community organizer who fought police brutality and addiction in Los Angeles and a practical politician who helped dig the state out of a historical fiscal crisis in 2008.The congresswoman is “someone who can heal our country – not just from the pandemic, but also from the racial isions, the economic isions”, the legendary labor organizer Dolores Huerta told the .Biden is expected to announce his running mate in the coming days. When the former vice-president earlier this year committed to choosing a woman to join his ticket, public speculation immediately coalesced around Kamala Harris, the California senator who ran against him in the Democratic presidential primaries. Buzz also circled Susan Rice, the Obama administration national security adviser, and Val Demings, the Florida congresswoman. But in recent weeks, Californians who worked with Bass – including Huerta – have openly campaigned for her as vice-president, propelling her to the top of Biden’s shortlist.Bass’s supporters commend her fierce commitment to advancing social justice, and an easy charm that has helped her win over liberals and staunch conservatives alike. But others worry her politics are too far to the left to appeal to moderate voters, as the vice-presidential vetting process resurfaced some of her political controversies – including past comments about the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro that could alienate expats in the political quagmire of Florida.Bass grew up in a Black, middle-class neighborhood Los Angeles, trained as a physician assistant and worked in an emergency room. As the crack epidemic hit LA, she began a substance abuse and treatment center – a non-profit that grew into the Community Coalition, which remains an influential advocacy group in the city.At a time when the government moved to further criminalize drug possession and violently police Black and brown neighborhoods, Bass argued addiction was a public health crisis and advocated against the infamous 1994 “tough on crime” law that Biden helped write. She lobbied to replace liquor shops in South LA with housing and grocery stores, battled to build more schools and campaigned to keep children from being forced into foster care.She won a seat in the California assembly in 2004 and was elected speaker of the assembly two years later, becoming the first Black woman to lead a state legislative house.In the state capital, Sacramento, she found herself at the center of a wholly different kind of crisis. Republicans and Democrats had been locked in a months-long stalemate over how to address a $41m deficit in the aftermath of the Great Recession. “When Karen walked into the negotiations, it just changed the dynamics in the room,” said Mike Villines, who was the assembly’s Republican minority leader. “She would really listen to everybody, and at first – we even thought – is this a trick?”Bass held firmly to her goals to minimize cuts to education and healthcare, said Darrell Steinberg, the mayor of Sacramento and the Democratic leader of the state senate at the time. “Yet she was also the epitome of ‘you can disagree strongly without being disagreeable,’” he said. Steinberg, Bass, Villines and their colleagues won a John F Kennedy Profiles in Courage award for the compromise they reached in February 2009.Bass was elected chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in 2018. And in the aftermath of protests following the death of George Floyd, she is leading her party’s effort to reform the police, and, to an extent, reverse the legacy of Democratic policies that unequally incarcerated Black and brown Americans.The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act she helped develop passed in Congress and was backed by every Democratic representative and three Republicans. The bill, which is unlikely to be taken up by the Republican-led Senate, curbs “qualified immunity”, a legal provision that shields police. It makes lynching a federal crime, and incentivizes local police departments to ban chokeholds – but it doesn’t defund the police or direct resources away from law enforcement, as activists have long demanded.“No, I don’t think it’s time to defund the police,” Bass told Fox LA, though she echoed an argument that many supporters of defunding make – that police shouldn’t be the ones responding to every type of emergency. When the government underfunds social programs and healthcare, “police are left to pick up the pieces, and that’s wrong”, she said. “They’re not social workers – why should they be dealing with social, economic and health problems.”Though Biden’s views on policing have evolved since he spearheaded his crime bill, the duo’s politics still erge significantly. She supports the ambitious Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis, and Medicare for All as a solution to the nation’s healthcare woes. He prefers more moderate options.But the two also have a lot in common personally, and philosophically. She, like him, was struck by tragedy early in her political career. In 2006, less than two years after she was inaugurated to the California state assembly, her 23-year old daughter, Emilia, and son-in-law Michael died in a car accident.Bass has discussed the loss with Biden, whose wife and one-year-old daughter died in a car crash in 1972. “The most difficult part of that was – and it was the same with him – when those accidents happened, both of us were in public life,” Bass said in an interview with Ozy. “The world is watching you grieving.”Like Biden, Bass said she struggled to “carry on” afterwards. “I began to understand how despair led people to just cash it in,” Biden wrote in his memoir about the period following his wife and daughter’s death. For Bass, it was the memory of her daughter that “allowed her to continue”, she said. “Because she would have been very upset with me if I didn’t continue.”Both politicians also share a commitment to bipartisanship – a motivation or obligation to reach out to those they don’t agree with, and look for common values. The same way Biden’s supporters celebrate his goofball affability, Bass’s colleagues and friends praise her disarming charm. “You can put Karen anywhere, even in the most rightwing, ultra-conservative district, and she’ll get some of the people there into conversation with them,” said Fabian Núñez, who was the California assembly speaker before Bass.“She’s genuinely very, very nice,” Steinberg told the . “She’s good people.”Villines, who remains a Republican, said that nonetheless “I would be very comfortable with Karen in high positions in government, because I know she absolutely is a real person who’s been through some really difficult things and who’s really just trying to get things done.”Even the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy – a Trump ally who shares almost no political common ground with progressive Bass – has called her his “favorite Democrat” for her ability to negotiate.It may seem a remarkable contradiction then that progressives have openly endorsed Bass as a champion of “transformative change” who would give liberals a voice at the White House. “She knows where to hold the line,” Steinberg explained.Bass’s political goals at the moment don’t seem to include an eventual run for president – and she says it never has. “You can look back in my life, and I think it’s pretty clear that I didn’t set out to run for president,’’ she said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “I have always been focused on work.”Now that she is a top candidate for veep, her public vetting has been “a very interesting process a trip down memory lane”, she joked. Her past work in Cuba has come under particular scrutiny.In the 1970s, Bass worked for the Venceremos Brigade, a joint venture of Fidel Castro’s government and Students for a Democratic Society, the leftist, antiwar group in the US. Bass has said that she helped build housing and healthcare facilities with the group, to help the Cuban people. She’s also faced criticism for referring to Castro as “Comandante en Jefe” – a title that Cuban expats in the US denounce – when the dictator died in 2016, and for eulogizing Oneil Marion Cannon, a top member of the Communist Party USA as a “friend and mentor”.Republicans have seized on an opportunity to paint Bass as a Castro supporter, and a communist, in particular to Cuban Americans in swing states like Florida. Bass argues her position on Cuba “is really no different than the position of the Obama administration”. She accompanied Obama in 2016 on his historic visit to the country. Bass has also stressed that she is not a communist, but said she appreciated Cannon’s work for his community in Los Angeles and his commitment to campaigning for Black and brown candidates.Amid heightened scrutiny of her past, the Los Angeles Times also revealed that Bass has earned consulting fees from a community non-profit that she founded, and that her campaign had funded. Bass has maintained that her income and the campaign donations are unrelated, and the non-profit has corroborated her position.Another concern for critics is Bass’s effusive speech at the 2010 opening of the Church of Scientology’s headquarters in LA, when she praised the group’s founder L Ron Hubbard. She told a crowd of 6,000, “your creed is a universal creed and one that speaks to all people everywhere”.In a statement, Bass said she was looking for an “area of agreement” with the church, and in the decade since “published first-hand accounts in books, interviews and documentaries have exposed this group”. Scientology defectors have alleged intimidation, abuse and human trafficking. “Just so you all know, I proudly worship at First New Christian Fellowship Baptist Church in South LA,” Bass noted in her statement.Huerta, who supported Kamala Harris in the presidential primaries but recently published an op-ed endorsing Bass for vice-president, said the discussions around the congresswoman’s past had created a “fantasma”, or ghost, “designed to frighten supporters”.“It’s ridiculous,” she said “You have Donald Trump who praised the dictator in North Korea,” she said. When the president has failed to condemn, and even exalted leaders who have overseen humanitarian atrocities, Huerta said, “it’s silly” for Republicans to fixate on Bass’s record on Cuba."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3021289d4fe1509d5d16a6eaa3cf637add93abf8/0_146_4409_2647/master/4409.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2d3971e4834d4ff727028a2b73f83fda","title":"beirut blast timeline what we know and what we dont explosion lebanon","story":"What happened in the months and years leading up to the explosion at the Lebanese capital’s port?by  Michael Safi and  Andrew RothBeirut is still counting the cost in lives and property from a massive explosion at its port on Tuesday that sent a shockwave blasting across the city. Anger is growing in Lebanon at what appears to be an industrial accident that authorities foresaw and warned about for years before. The Lebanese government is currently investigating, but many in the country and internationally are calling for an independent probe.Exactly what happened at the port in the early evening of 4 August is still unclear, but several facts have come to light in the days since the blast. The trail begins nearly seven years ago, with a rickety ship leaving the eastern European state of Georgia, carrying a deadly load.The Rhosus, a Russian-owned, Moldovan-flagged merchant vessel departs from Batumi, Georgia en route to Mozambique carrying 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. The bill of lading shows the chemicals were purchased by Fabrica de Explosivos, a Mozambican industrial explosives company.The company that manages the Mozambican port of Beira says it was never notified of any such cargo arriving, according to Portuguese media. According to an interview with the ship’s former captain, the vessel made stops in Turkey and Pireaus, Greece.The Rhosus makes a stop in Beirut. Some sources suggest it did so due to a technical fault, but the former captain has claimed it wanted to take on extra cargo to make the voyage more profitable. There, the crew went on strike due to unpaid wages, he says. Lebanese authorities refused to let the ship leave, claiming since the explosion they believed it was unseaworthy.But the ship’s former captain has said it was stopped due to unpaid port fees. The International Transport Workers Federation, which sought back wages and repatriation for the crew, confirmed that the ship was being held in part because it owed the port $100,000 in unpaid bills. Some of the crew were not allowed to leave for another 11 months, claiming they were “incarcerated” on the vessel.The then-director of Lebanese customs, Shafik Merhi, sends a letter to an “urgent matters judge” warning of the danger of the ammonium nitrate and asking for a ruling on what should be done with it, Al Jazeera reports.Another letter is sent in December of that year and in May 2015 again asking for a resolution, according to the current Lebanese customs director, Badri Daher.Shipping website FleetMon says the Rhosus has by this point been “abandoned” by its owner.The 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate aboard the Rhosus has by this point been placed in a warehouse and the ship is detained at the port, according to lawyers for the crew, who have since been released from the vessel.It is not known how much longer the empty vessel remained in Beirut, or where it went afterwards. The ship’s former captain says it sank “two or three years ago”.Lebanese customs officials send three more letters to the judiciary. The latest, sent on 27 October 2017, urges the judge to make a quick decision in light of “the danger … of leaving these goods in the place they are, and to those working there”.They claim that the letters are ignored and nothing is done.A state security report is submitted to the judiciary, the presidency and the intelligence and customs directorates warning of “the real danger arising from these materials”, according to the Lebanese news outlet Al-Akhbar. It makes several recommendations, including that a hole in warehouse 12, where the highly explosive material is being kept, be sealed to prevent theft.An anonymous source close to a port employee has told Reuters that a team inspected the ammonium nitrate six months before the explosion and warned that if it was not moved, it would “blow up all of Beirut”.Lebanon’s public works minister, Michel Najjar, learns of the presence of the ammonium nitrate at the port from a report he receives from the country’s supreme defence council, he told Al-Jazeera.A fire is reported at the Beirut port. Exactly how and where it started are not clear. Lebanese media has quoted the port’s general manager, Hossan Koraytem, as claiming that a team of welders was sealing the gap in warehouse 12 and finished their work by noon. Unnamed security sources have claimed that the crew finished before 5pm.Reuters on Wednesday quoted sources as claiming that the fire started at nearby warehouse 9 and spread to warehouse 12, with no mention of any welding.Others have observed the sputtering red explosions that preceded the large blast in some videos suggest that fireworks might have been the source of the initial fire.At least 10 firefighters are dispatched to the port to put out the fire, which by 5.54pm is sending plumes of thick smoke above Beirut.A massive blast shakes Beirut. One of the first markers of the event on social media is a tweet from Adam Baron, a resident of a neighbourhood close to the port. His tweet appears at 6.09pm. He says he sent it “while I was still cowering, so within a minute” of the explosion.The port is reduced to a deep crater surrounded by a smouldering wasteland, while buildings close to the point of origin of the explosion are severely damaged.Windows are broken and walls caved in up to 5km away, and the blast is heard across Lebanon and more than 200km away in Cyprus.Beirut’s governor, Marwan Abboud, estimates that up to $15bn damage has been done to the city and that 300,000 homes are damaged, many left uninhabitable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fabdf9932a25b67c2213d456132d42f9f7745ab5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a07d8a0608f4fa04e7315395d6fd4e","title":"beirut explosion before and after satellite images","story":"Satellite images show the scale of the damage caused by Tuesday’s explosions in the Lebanese capital, with buildings miles from the port lying in ruin.

So what do they think of the new surge now? During the initial peak of Spain’s Covid-19 pandemic in the spring, the virus displayed an unexpected mercy. In its spread, ferocity and awful novelty, it left health workers too tired and overwhelmed to look beyond the next few hours.“There’s no time to get angry or to wonder why things have been organised the way they have been,” Sara Gayoso, an A\u0026ampE doctor at El Escorial hospital near Madrid, told the  at the end of March.Five months on, as Gayoso and her colleagues across Spain and many parts of Europe are braced for a second wave, there has been ample time for reflection.Over the past two weeks, Spain has recorded more than 35,000 new Covid-19 cases – two-thirds of them in just three regions: Catalonia, Aragón and Madrid. According to the health ministry, there are currently 580 active outbreaks across the country.Gayoso can hardly bear to countenance the idea of a second wave as devastating as the first.“I don’t even want to think about it,” she said. “We’d obviously have to do whatever we could, but we’re still so tired that I don’t know we’d have the strength to go through it all again. If there was to be another wave like that one, it would be a catastrophe.”But, for the time being at least, Gayoso’s hospital is not seeing anything resembling the scenes of the spring.“The situation at the moment doesn’t bear comparison with how things were in March and April,” she said. “We’re dealing with a few cases a day, but most of them are allowed home unless they’re very old.”And, as she points out, protocols have been put in place, stocks of ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) purchased and salted away, and staff advised to take their holidays now in anticipation of a busy autumn of Covid-19 and flu.Juan Camilo Meza, an anaesthetist at Mataró hospital near Barcelona, also acknowledges that while the numbers are once again surging, “we’re nowhere near the kind of awful situation we were in a few months ago”.As Meza and others point out, many of the new cases are asymptomatic and many are being detected in much younger people than last time round.“I don’t think we’re going to see another peak as powerful as the previous one,” he added. “We’re seeing an uptick now, but that was always going to be the case.”Cases are also mushrooming in France, where the president, Emmanuel Macron, has convened a meeting next week of the country’s defence council.Macron called for “the greatest vigilance” and reminded people to “systematically wear masks” inside and “when it is not possible to keep the safe distance”.“At the moment, we’re not seeing enough serious cases in hospital and intensive care to qualify as a second wave, but there is definitely a surge,” says Dr Serge Smadja, who is a GP in Paris and secretary general of SOS Médecins, the health response service that dispatches doctors to people’s houses.“The figures went down and now they are going up so it’s a surge. The virus is still there. We cannot return to life as it was before as if nothing has happened.”Like his colleagues across the Pyrenees, Smadja does not want to contemplate a return to the first wave.“We don’t want to relive what we went through before,” he said.“We are the frontline. Lots of our doctors were infected with Covid-19. We had a lack of equipment. Hospitals were at their limit of saturation. We had patients and no tests and no idea what we could do.”But at least this time, he added, people know how to minimise the risks: “Everyone needs to be humble about this, take care and pay attention.”On Thursday, Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, said the daily increase of around 1,000 cases was currently “manageable” for the health system, but warned the level should not be allowed to get much higher.From Saturday, anyone returning from one of the country’s 130 Covid-19 hotspots will be required to take an obligatory test.Germany’s main doctors’ association, the Marburger Bund, believes the country is already experiencing a second wave. Or, as the association’s head, Susanne Johna, put it: “We find ourselves in a second, flat upwards rise.”Germany’s hospitals should be in a better position to cope now thanks to the introduction of beds specially equipped with adequate facilities to treat coronavirus cases, said Johna.However, she suggested the country was “in danger of squandering the success we have achieved so far, out of a combination of suppression and a desire for things to return to normal”.As the number of cases grows, so do the calls for a proper investigation into how things were handled during the first half of 2020.On Thursday, a group of 20 Spanish health experts wrote to the Lancet, calling for an independent evaluation of Spain’s response to the pandemic.“This evaluation should not be conceived as an instrument for apportioning blame,” they said.The idea was instead to establish exactly how a country with “one of the best performing health systems in the world” had logged more than 300,000 cases, more than 28,000 deaths – the majority of them in care homes – and seen more than 50,000 health workers infected with the virus.The signatories are not the only ones calling for lessons to be learned as quickly as possible.“Back in March and April, we could all say, ‘this has taken us by surprise’ – and that was the excuse used for the system not being able to cope with all that,” said Pablo Cereceda, a surgeon at the same hospital as Gayoso, who is also a representative for the Amyts medical association.“But now we can’t say we weren’t warned. We had three months of ‘ceasefire’ and if we haven’t made the most of it, it’ll be a disaster.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df8805ffe4f992611c02c6ad7051daa7a1fec5aa/0_49_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=debe42268cd6ce565cda2b31d7a1e940","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance. I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance. Let young people enjoy being teenagers so we can enjoy adulthood.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, the people featured recommend these Instagram accounts: @bodyposipanda @i_weigh @mattzhaig @crazyheadcomics @muslimgirl @the_indian_feminist @privtoprog @Ayat_Zaman"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324862.1596828024!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"masks to be worn in schools when 2m cannot be maintained","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is now recommended that teachers and secondary school students wear face coverings. Photograph: iStock Secondary school students and primary and post-primary teachers will be required to wear face coverings in class when a physical distance of 2m cannot be maintained, according to new Department of Education guidance.On Friday, Minister for Education Norma Foley issued an update on the roadmap for reopening schools at the end of the summer.The updated guidelines state that teachers and second-level students should wear face coverings, similar to those worn in shops or on public transport, when a physical distance of 2m cannot be maintained.These face coverings worn should be reusable and washed once daily, the guidance adds. All staff and students using the post-primary school transport service will be required to wear face coverings on the bus, the guidance states.All special needs assistants (SNAs) will be required to wear face coverings or, in certain situations, clear visors in the classroom, and other staff such as bus escorts who have close contact with students will be required to wear face coverings.John Boyle, general secretary of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) has welcomed the updated guidelines. “Schools will have the option of ordering face coverings centrally on the newly established Government procurement portal.”“Fórsa sought and received confirmation that schools will be able to draw down and purchase adequate stocks of N75 face masks, which protect against the contraction of Covid-19,” he said.Martin Marjoram, president of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI), said it was “vital” that required resources be provided to schools as they prepared to reopen.Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) general secretary Kieran Christie said: “Keeping schools open must be the priority, and this means minimising the risk of transmission within classrooms and other learning environments.”Meanwhile, the Teaching Council said it was introducing a “range of interventions” to increase the supply of registered teachers available to fill vacancies, including supervision and substitution roles, to support the reopening of schools for the upcoming school year.The council said there were 106,000 qualified teachers registered with the Teaching Council, and an estimated 6,000 of those are not fully deployed in schools and may be available for substitution and supervision.The council said it would be contacting this potential grouping directly to encourage their participation in supporting the return to school.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324898.1596821262!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"three northern cheetah cubs born at fota wildlife park","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Two of the three new endangered Northern cheetah cubs at Fota Wildlife Park.

Fota Wildlife Park has announced the birth of three Northern cheetah cubs – an endangered species.The cubs, one male and two females, were born on June 10th and have only recently started venturing out of their cubbing den. They have spent the last few days enjoying the mild weather playing together in the grass and on the logs of their habitat on Cheetah Hill in Fota.Fota Wildlife Park, a conservation charity, estimates it lost €1.5 million in revenues during the 10-week closure earlier in the year due to Covid-19. Since then it has introduced an online booking system to safely manage the numbers entering the Park – capping the maximum amount of people at any one time within the 100-acre park at 1,500.The cubs’ mother Nimpy is 10 years old and was born in Parc Zoologique de La Palmyre, France. The father Sam is four years old and was born in Wadi Al Safa Wildlife Centre, Dubai. The birth of these cubs brings the total for this endangered species born in Fota to 204.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has classified the subspecies status for the Northern cheetah as endangered. Lead ranger at Fota Julien Fonteneau, said they are delighted to be announcing a second litter of Northern cheetah cubs since reopening in May.“Without a doubt, the Northern cheetah is the most successful breeding programme here and the species has become synonymous with the Park – it’s even on our logo. We put that breeding success down to the naturalistic habitats and environments that we create for the animals.”Dublin Zoo is also celebrating following the arrival of a baby siamang gibbon. It is a primate and the largest of the gibbon species. They are black-furred apes with very long arms, much longer than their legs. They are also the only gibbons with both opposable thumbs and toes. They can weigh between 10 to 12 kgs and have large throat pouches which allow them to vocalise and sing. They can often be heard singing in Dublin Zoo from 10 to 11am each day.The baby was born overnight last Sunday to parents Cahaya (10) and Luca (19). Before this arrival they were the only siamang gibbons at Dublin Zoo, with Cahaya arriving in 2014 and Luca in 2018.Extremely importantIt was love at first sight – or at least “ a strong connection from the very first day they met”, according to staff who said “the healthy baby is exceptionally welcome news for everyone involved with the zoo”.Ciaran McMahon, team leader at Dublin Zoo added: “We are absolutely delighted to welcome this siamang gibbon baby to Dublin Zoo. The species is listed as endangered so every birth is extremely important. Cahaya and Luca are the most loving couple, very attentive to each other’s needs, and we have no doubt that they will make excellent parents.”Siamang gibbons are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. Their natural habitat is the canopy of semi-deciduous and evergreen forests in the Barisan Mountains of west-central Sumatra, Indonesia, the mountains of the Malay Peninsula, Malaysia, and in a small southern peninsular area of Thailand.Dublin Zoo, a not-for-profit organisation, is also currently operating at a reduced capacity due to Covid-19, and tickets must be booked online in advance."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Julien Behal Residents of Kildare, Laois and Offaly face limits on their movement for at least two weeks as part of a series of new restrictions in these areas in a bid to control a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases. Taoiseach Micheál Martin also said cafes, restaurants and pubs in these three counties will close from midnight for two weeks as well as cinemas, theatres and museums. There will be no sporting events or matches and all gyms will close.People in the three affected counties will only be allowed travel within their own county, unless it is for work or medical appointments, or for family reasons. There will be an exemption for those who need to travel for farming reasons. There will be no travel into the three counties other than for work, medical reasons or other essential reasons like farming.Those who need to get to other destinations through those counties will be able to do so but will be asked not to stop while travelling through these counties.Garda checkpoints will be placed in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly to ensure people do not flout the restrictions, Garda sources said. Regulations were expected to be drawn up over the weekend by the Department of Health which would again give gardaí the power to arrest people who breach the travel restrictions and who refuse to comply when stopped at a checkpoint. Minister for Health Simon Donnelly said regulations are being put together to enforce the new restrictions. He said there would be Garda checkpoints in the three counties although he said “we will succeed by solidarity.” The regulations will apply from Sunday night onwards, he said.Extraordinary lockdownThe Department of Health on Friday reported another four deaths and 98 new cases - bringing the total number of deaths in Ireland to 1,772, and the number of confirmed cases to 26,470.Mr Martin has said the extraordinary lockdown of the three Leinster counties where there have been alarming increases in cases in the past two weeks was done to prevent any widespread return of the virus. “I want to be very clear that the Government is determined to do everything possible to prevent the return of widespread transmission of the virus” he said. Speaking from Government Buildings, Mr Martin said the “process of reopening is not simple. It is not a case of moving forward step by step”. Mr Martin said he understood the increasing impatience that many people feel. “There is a huge desire to get back to normal life.”However, he added, the coronavirus pandemic presented “a deep and urgent threat, which is merciless and unrelenting”.Mr Martin said: “While the burden of the decision falls heaviest on the three counties of Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the message needs to be understood everywhere in Ireland. There is nothing inevitable about keeping the disease under control.”Working conditions in meat factories Acting chief medical officer Ronan Glynn said on Friday evening that he was not in a position to offer guarantees that the partial restrictions would be lifted in two weeks’ time. He said the aim of acting at this point was to stop community transmission before it can take hold.“While I know the next two weeks are going to be difficult for many, we need to continue to work together.” He said he was not surprised that people are angry and disappointed and said the reality is that the virus spread quite quickly in these counties. “We felt really at this point we had to move.”He said there were significant clusters in these areas as opposed to community transmission but that it would be “too late” to contain potential community transmission if action was not taken. On the issue of meat factories and concerns about the working conditions of workers there, Dr Glynn said dedicated outbreak control teams have been put in place over recent months and that “it did appear that things had come under control”. In terms of factories, Dr Glynn said two of the factories have over 80 cases. The dog food factory in Naas has just over 50 cases. “We do know the people working in these facilities often live together, and travel to work together, and within the factories they work very closely together. Many of the environments are loud so people are shouting. There are a whole range of factors that lead to these sectors being high risk,”he said. Dáil deputies representing Kildare, Laois and Offaly from across the political spectrum have called for emergency funding for businesses impacted and have been highly critical of the delayed response of State agencies to the “obvious” risks of outbreaks in meat processing plants and direct provision centres. Restrictions Under the new measures announced this evening people living in the three counties are advised to avoid public transport, particularly those who are vulnerable. Indoor gatherings will be restricted to six people. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to around 15 people as long as strict social distancing can be maintained.While restaurants and bars will have to close except for takeaway, those who can offer seats for 15 people outside can do so as long as strict social distancing is maintained.Hotels can remain open but must limit occupancy to essential non-social and non-tourist reasons. Existing guests can remain for the duration of their booking.The Taoiseach said those who can work from home in this region should do so. Plans to reopen schools remain unchanged.Shops will remain open but shoppers must wear masks. All cinemas, theatres, casinos, betting shops, bingo halls, gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools, exercise and dance studios must close.Attendance at a funeral service and burial or cremation ceremony should be limited to 25 outdoors. Indoor events connected to the funeral are limited to a maximum of 6 people.Places of worship remain open for private prayer, while services are to be held online.Prison visits, nursing home visits and hospital visits will also be suspended under the new regional lockdown plan with the exception of the most critical and compassionate circumstances (for example end of life). More cases Meanwhile, a food processing plant in Co Kildare has announced further cases of coronavirus among its workers. O’Brien Fine Foods said it stopped operations at its Timohoe facility at 9pm on Wednesday after 80 workers tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, the firm announced a further six cases of coronavirus have been detected, adding in a statement that the “level of asymptomatic infectivity appears to be very high”.

Photograph: Dave ThompsonPA WireThe reopening of schools in many EU countries has not led to significant increases in community transmission of Covid-19, according to a new report.Child-to-child transmission of the disease in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of infection in children attending class, particularly in preschools and primary schools, the report by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) suggests.Schools are unlikely to be more effective environments for propagating the virus than other work or leisure settings with similar densities of people, the report states.“Decisions on control measures in schools and school closuresopenings should be consistent with decisions on other physical distancing and public health response measures within the community,” it says.With the Government planning a full reopening of Irish schools in the autumn, public health officials here have been waiting for the publication of this ECDC report before finalising their guidance to the education sector. At present, it is not a requirement that student have to wear face-coverings when schools reopen though there have been calls for this to be made mandatory, as it is in retail environments.The report says face-masks are “challenging” to implement in the school setting “as it is known that children will have a lower tolerance andor may not be able to use the mask properly”.Some EU states require children to wear masks, particularly those under 12, while Belgium and Czechia require teachers and other staff to do the same. Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands do not have this requirement for students or staff.AsymptomaticThe report says less than 5 per cent of overall Covid-19 cases in the EU and the United Kingdom are among children, and these are much less likely than adults to be hospitalised or die.Children are more likely to have a mild or asymptomatic infection, but this means the infection may go undetected or undiagnosed.When they have symptoms, children shed virus in similar quantities to adults and can infect others in a similar way to adults. The report says it is unknown how infectious asymptomatic children are.“While very few significant outbreaks of Covid-19 in schools have been documented, they do occur, and may be difficult to detect due to the relative lack of symptoms in children.”In general, most countries report slightly lower seroprevalence in children than among adults, but these differences are “small and uncertain” and more specialised studies are needed, the ECDC says.It acknowledges the evidence on the impact of school closures and reopening on community transmission levels is conflicting but adds that observational data from some EU countries, along with the results of contact tracing, suggest it is not associated with significant increases.“Available evidence also indicates that closures of childcare and educational institutions are unlikely to be an effective single control measure for community transmission of Covid-19 and such closures would be unlikely to provide significant additional protection of children’s health, since most develop a very mild form of Covid-19, if any.”However, decisions on control measures in schools and school closuresopenings should be consistent with decisions on other physical distancing and public health response measures within the community.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda checkpoints to enforce new travel limits, cafes and pubs to close for two weeksCourt told investigation into murder is proceeding as \u0026lsquospeedily as possible\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute say the find has removed a significant quantity of heroin from circulationESB granted an injunction directing a family to leave substation lands in WicklowTDs criticise delayed response of State agencies to \u0026lsquoobvious\u0026rsquo meat plant risksGovernment says all employees and self-employed are entitled to \u0026euro350 paymentLimitations on travel, cafes, pubs and restaurants to shut and new limits on gatheringsMeat Industry Ireland says outbreaks in meat plants \u0026lsquoa stark reminder of the persistent threat of Covid-19\u0026rsquoCourt of Appeal hears man would lose right to marry if he is made ward of courtDublin Zoo also celebrating arrival of a baby siamang gibbonKildare, Laois and Offaly account for almost half of all new cases reported in last 14 daysAll staff and students using school transport service must wear face coveringPSNI questioning man (54) over incidents, as clubs says \u0026lsquoOur door remains open to all\u0026rsquoPeople aged 75 and over accounted for 80 per cent of all Covid-19 deaths in NorthProposed scheme to provide high-capacity link from eastern to western suburbsDog food company in Naas to reopen on \u0026lsquophased\u0026rsquo basis Monday following shutdownReport finds child-to-child transmission of the disease in schools is uncommonReport finds although supply has increased during pandemic affordability has not improvedHighs of 25 degrees expected as a settled spell is expected over the country\u0026lsquoNo additional capacity\u0026rsquo in existing foster care pool during pandemic, briefing documents sayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324851.1596822448!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"main points what restrictions have been imposed on kildare offaly and laois","story":"An Taoiseach Micheál Martin outlines the new measures that will come into effect as a two-week local lockdown is announced for Kildare, Laois and Offaly following a spike in Covid-19 cases in the region.

These represent almost half of all cases detected in Ireland during that time.The measures, which were recommended by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), were confirmed by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.The measures are set to come into force at midnight and last for at least two weeks.Main points of the new restrictions for the midlandsTravel and transport Residents of Kildare, Offaly and Laois can only travel within their own county, other than for the following reasons:People are asked not to travel into any of these counties, other than for the reasons above, and you need to travel through these counties to get somewhere else.People are asked not stop in Kildare, Laois or Offaly during a journey unless for essential purposes.Public and private transport  Residents of these counties should not use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary. And where possible they should not share private vehicles with others from outside their household.Economic activity and work  Anyone in these counties who can work from home should work from home.Cafes and restaurants  All cafes and restaurants, including bars operating as restaurants, should only offer takeaway or delivery, or outdoor dining (maximum 15 people with strict physical distancing). Otherwise they should close.Hotels can remain open but must limit occupancy to essential non-social and non-tourist reasons. Existing guests can remain for the duration of their booking.Indoor gatherings  All indoor gatherings should be restricted to a maximum of six people from no more than three households, while maintaining physical distancing.Outdoor gatherings  Outdoor gatherings should be limited to a maximum of 15 people, while maintaining physical distancing.Cultural events and religious services  All cinemas, theatres, casinos, betting shops, bingo halls, gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools, exercise and dance studios must close at midnight.Attendance at a funeral service and burial or cremation ceremony should be limited to 25 outdoors.

Photograph: PAWhat is happening with face coverings?From Monday, it will be mandatory to wear face coverings in shops and shopping centres. Prior to this it was an advisoryThere has been a spike in Covid-19 numbers in the Republic in recent weeks. The five-day average has gone from a low single figures per day to approaching 50 per day.The Government is fearful of a rise in community transmission (as in cases where the source of infection is not know) which could put the country back to where we were at the start of the pandemic.Initially it was thought masks were not an effective protection against the virus. At the beginning of the pandemic scientists did not realise how infectious Covid-19 was and thought the drawbacks of asking everybody to wear a mask outweighed the benefits.However, as the pandemic progressed, epidemiologists have changed their view and now believe face coverings can stop the spread of the virus.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recently found the correct use of face masks by people who are asymptomatic may help reduce the spread of infection in the community who otherwise may have unwittingly spreading the virus.A recent study across 198 countries found those with cultural norms of mask-wearing had lower death rates from Covid-19.It explains how places like South Korea and Japan, where there is a strong culture of mask-wearing, have lower death rates than western countries and the United States where they are not the norm.While Perspex shields are not as effective at stopping the virus or the spread of it, they are better than nothing.How do masks work? Masks work by stopping most of the droplets which occur when people cough, sneeze or talk. They are better at protecting you from other people than vice versa, but if everybody wears a mask, the impact can be dramatic.In one case, a man flew from China to Toronto and subsequently tested positive for Covid-19.He had a dry cough and wore a mask on the flight yet all 25 people closest to him on the flight tested negative for Covid-19.In another case, in the United States, two hair stylists had close contact with 140 clients while sick with Covid-19. Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive.How will mask wearing be enforced? The legislation allowing for compulsory face coverings is the same as that used for compulsory face coverings on public transport.The wearing of face coverings will be enforced by a statutory instrument under the Irish Health Act 1947 as amended in 2020.It allows for a fine of up to €2,500 or six months in prison.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said the intervention of the gardaí will be a “last resort” when it came to enforcing the wearing of face coverings in shops and said there was a “huge level of compliance” already.Retail Ireland said it is “crucial that it does not fall to retail staff to ensure compliance”.The organisation’s director, Arnold Dillon, said enforcement of the measures should be left to the appropriate authorities and retail staff should not be exposed to “the potential disputes and discord that might arise”.So far the portents for mass compliance are good. The National Transport Authority says there has been 95 per cent compliance on public transport with the wearing of face coverings.NTA spokesman Dermot O’Gara said: “Compliance on face coverings has remained very high. The approach of engagement, education and encouragement seems to be working well.”A Government spokeswoman said she was not aware of any prosecutions for non-compliance with facemasks on public transport.Will everybody have to wear a face covering? As with public transport, no child under the age of 13 has to wear a mask in shops. Other exemptions are: those who cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress.Anyone who needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating, as in someone who is hard of hearing, is also exempted.Will children have to wear face coverings in schools? The guidelines for children returning to school is that it is not practical for many students to wear a mask properly for the duration of a school day.Cloth face coverings are not suitable for children under the age of 13 and anyone over that age who has trouble breathing, or has special needs and who may feel upset or very uncomfortable, should not wear one either.Older students should not be requested to wear a facial covering but can opt to wear one if they wish.Teachers will not be required to wear face masks, as they conceal facial expression and can make communication difficult except in situations where physical distancing is impossible.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324506.1596782289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove announces 650m brexit support package for the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove visited Northern Ireland on Friday with Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis.

The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Attitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324947.1596822915!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"authorities urge mask wearing as coronavirus on the rebound in europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCyclists wear protective face masks as they ride on a street in Antwerp. Britain and Belgium have imposed travel restrictions on one another. Photograph:  Francois WalschaertsAFP via Getty ImagesAuthorities issued appeals to the public to don face masks, keep distancing and exercise caution towards travel as a string of countries registered spikes in coronavirus infections across Europe.In France, cases have risen steeply to reach levels not seen since May, with more than 3,600 infections registered within 48 hours this week.“The virus continues to circulate very actively worldwide. There is an upward trend in France and Europe,” health ministry chief Jerome Salomon told a news conference. President Emmanuel Macron called a meeting of a defence council to address the rise and urged citizens to don face masks even in outdoor spaces.“I recommend the utmost vigilance,” Mr Macron said. “Get used to wearing your masks.”Italy saw a jump of 552 cases on Friday, the highest level since May, with the northeastern region of Veneto accounting for almost a third of the infections.“Vacations are a risk,” warned Veneto governor Luca Zaia, saying that most cases were found in people who had returned from travel in Spain, Peru, Malta, Croatia, and Greece.“Everyone must decide where they want to go on vacation, but it’s also true, that by us, for a couple of weeks now, we’re seeing a concentration of patients who were infected on vacation.”LockdownsHealth officials in Greece have sounded the alarm over an uptick in cases including on popular tourist islands, after its public health body recorded 150 overnight in the highest level for weeks.Preston became the latest British city to be put under tightened lockdown measures, as Britain and Belgium imposed travel restrictions on each other.\u0026nbspA pork processing plant in West Flanders reported 67 coronavirus infections, joining a string mass outbreaks in the meat industry, including in Ireland, Greece, Germany, the United States and Australia.Norway warned its citizens against all travel abroad, while Austria became the latest country to restrict travel to Spain due to an upsurge in the virus there as it reported 1,895 new infections in a day.Spanish health experts have called for an independent assessment of why Spain became one of the worst hit countries, despite its strong health system.“This evaluation should not be conceived as an instrument for apportioning blame,” the 20 experts wrote in the Lancet, asking why there had been more than 28,000 deaths and more than 50,000 health workers infected in a country with “one of the best performing health systems in the world”.InroadsThe disease appears to be making inroads in countries that previously escaped the worst of the pandemic, with upticks in infections in both Czech Republic and Slovakia, which have so far seen just 389 and 31 deaths respectively.Further afield Hong Kong, which is experiencing a third wave of infections, made free mass testing available for all citizens. The country has managed to limit deaths to just 46, but has seen an uptick in cases with new diagnoses coming in at a rate of over 100 per day for almost a fortnight.Japan, which has had a death toll so far of just over 1,000, is also experiencing mounting cases with 1,580 infections reported on Friday.The city of Melbourne in Australia has begun a six-week total lockdown, while the Philippines has reimposed a lockdown on about a quarter of the country’s 107 million people, after seeing a surge of cases in and around its capital Manila that fuelled infections to jump by 3,561 on Thursday.Despite steeply rising cases in Poland, the government said a lockdown was not on the cards.“There is no way that we would impose a general lockdown again,” said health minister Lukasz Szumowski. “There is no talk today, with the rising number of infected people or very high number of those who are still infected, of coming back to closing the economy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Michel Aoun says cause of Beirut explosion that killed more than 150 is still unknownBeirut blasts convince more and more that they live in a failed stateAnger mounts over missed warnings about consignment of ammonium nitrate at portAs Emmanuel Macron promises aid will not go to corrupt hands, locals say ruling class\u0026rsquos credibility is finishedCity hall lit up with the colours of the Lebanese flag following horrific explosionAmmonium nitrate that exploded on Tuesday arrived on the cargo ship Rhosus six years agoNew details of outbreak in Georgia suggest children may play key role in community transmissionIsraa Seblani was posing for her wedding video when a huge blast ripped through BeirutMore than 5,000 people reported injured as Lebanese officials say toll expected to riseHome of recently married Anthony and Maria Clery among those destroyedDevastating blast will widen political isions and send many more into povertyLebanese drew on experience of countlesss previous disasters in response to explosionUS president Donald Trump casts explosion as possible attack after blast near port kills at least 63Survivors of horrific crimes face a legacy of terror, says Amnesty InternationalOther countries \u0026lsquodefinitely should not do what we have done\u0026rsquo, Israeli government adviser warnsAgreement also reached to join forces with the military in conflict with Houthi rebels\u0026lsquoShield of Israel\u0026rsquo plan devised after government\u0026rsquos response to the second wave widely seen as chaoticGrouping of countries looking east called \u0026lsquoaxis of the sanctioned\u0026rsquoKing Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sunny day hiroshima 75 years atomic bomb","story":"It is Monday 16 July 1945, 5.30 am, and a sodden night in the New Mexico desert is suddenly a sunny day.“The whole country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun,” writes General Thomas Farrell, deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, the secret team in Los Alamos dedicated to creating the bomb. “It was golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue. It lighted every peak, crevasse, and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined.”Just four hours after the ‘Trinity’ test, the first nuclear detonation in history, a ship leaves San Francisco, bound for Tinian Island in the South West Pacific. On board is Little Boy, only the second nuclear bomb ever created.That night the people of Hiroshima feel relatively safe. They have grown so used to American B-29 bombers passing overhead, they have nicknamed them ‘B-San’ or ‘Mr B’. Like the rest of the world, they have never heard of the atom bomb. They do not know that Hiroshima has deliberately been spared conventional bombing so its devastating effects will be clear. Little Boy’s final destination is still not set. The US Targeting Committee has narrowed the possible targets down to three: Hiroshima, Kokura and Nagasaki. The ultimate decision will be chosen based on prevailing weather conditions.6th August. 00.02 For the first time, the crew of the B-29 named Enola Gay is told what weapon they will be carrying. Captain William ‘Deak’ Parsons informs them it will be the most furious explosion since creation, that it might crack the Earth’s crust. In Hiroshima, it is a clear night full of shooting stars.02.45 The Enola Gay takes off. It has been named after pilot Colonel Paul Tibbett’s “courageous red-haired mother”. In Tibbett’s pocket are cyanide capsules, one for each member of his crew, in case of capture. As the aeroplane heaves itself into the air, the crew still do not know where they are heading.04.00 Dr Michihiko Hachiya, a physician at the Hiroshima Communications Hospital, finishes his air raid duty. There is nothing to report.06.41 Captain Parsons begins arming the warhead. He has taken it upon himself to do this en route, dismantling and reassembling Little Boy in the freezing bomb bay. Four heavily-laden B-29s have recently crashed taking off from the Tinian runway, which ends in a cliff. Little Boy weighs 9,700 lbs and required special sunken bays to be dug just to load it into the aircraft. The chance of catastrophe is too great.07.29 “The hour was early the morning still, warm, and beautiful,” Dr Hachiya noted in his diary. “Shimmering leaves, reflecting sunlight from a cloudless sky, made a pleasant contrast with shadows in my garden as I gazed absently through wide-flung doors opening to the south.”High above, the weather plane assigned to check conditions in Hiroshima ahead of the mission passes over the city. An air raid siren greets it, but it’s just Mr B making his rounds. Only now is the target set.08.14 Bombardier Thomas Ferebee on board Enola Gay spots the Aioi Hashi, a T-shaped bridge at the heart of the city. A tone warns the crew of the aircraft to brace themselves. The citizens of Hiroshima hear nothing but a distant thrum. There is no siren. The fireball is hotter than the surface of the sun. Almost everything within one mile of the centre is vaporised instantly. Winds of more than 650 miles per hour turn every shard of wood not immediately incinerated into shrapnel. One quarter of a city of 350,000 are killed instantly. The mountains that surround the city, which gave Hiroshima such pleasant weather, produce a ‘focussing effect’ for the shockwave.The bomb is a grotesque act of creation. It took some of the world’s finest and most creative minds, and $2 billion (more than £18 billion in today’s money), to bring it to life. At the moment of detonation it replaces the historic city of Hiroshima with something new. Hiroshima was known as Mizu no Miyako or the ‘City of Water’. Now it is, according to Dr Hachiya, “no longer a city but a burnt-over prairie”, a City of Fire.Naked survivors, the patterns of their clothes burned into their backs, wander dazed through the inferno, driven by an unbearable thirst. Many die in reservoirs, swimming pools and water tanks, or drown in the swift Ōta river. The outline of the sun through the dust is red. A black rain falls from the sky. Hiroshima is now, in a word repeated over and over again by survivors, “Hell.”It took J Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, 15 minutes to accept the possibility of fission, then a week to sketch Little Boy on his blackboard. He explained: “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.”Yet at heart, Little Boy was barely more sophisticated than a medieval cannon, firing a uranium bullet down a tube into a target. The scientists were so confident the contraption would work, they never bothered to test it. The Trinity ‘gadget’ and Fat Man, the bomb later dropped on Nagasaki, were more sophisticated ‘implosion’ devices.The technology developed quickly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Massive weapons like the thermonuclear Tzar Bomba (thousands of times more powerful than Little Boy) gave way to missile defence shields like Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars, which in turn inspired smarter missiles. The creative spiral was only averted by bans and treaties that are now decaying. There are currently around 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world, down from a high of 70,000 in 1986. How does Little Boy compare to their power? Sharon Squassoni, a global security expert from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, bursts into laughter. It’s not reassuring.“There’s just no comparison, the shift in our nuclear arsenal is astounding. We have a wide range of power and capabilities. We even have bombs where you can dial in the yield before use.”Moreover, the trend towards smaller weapons designed for less indiscriminate destruction doesn’t necessarily make us safer. Seth Baum, executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, explains:“In military circles, the overall trend over the years has been away from mass destruction to precision, reducing collateral damage. However, the argument goes that precision actually makes it more likely that we might use them.”New and ever more versatile weapons are now on the horizon, from unpredictable hypersonic delivery systems designed to zig-zag past missile shields, to high-altitude strikes that would disable our electronics and communications networks.For some, the old ways are still the best. The relative simplicity of gun-type devices like Little Boy mean they are perfect for terrorists looking to assemble their own. With the proliferation of nuclear states and lax security in countries of the former Soviet Union, getting fissile material is less a problem than you might think. One Russian prosecutor in a case involving the theft of uranium noted that potatoes were guarded better. There is no reason why a modern-day remake of Little Boy would be any less powerful than the original, says Squassoni. “Of course it would be as powerful as Hiroshima. Little Boy was 15 kilotons – that’s a pretty small bomb.”The hard part has already been done. Creating the bomb was difficult. Recreating it isn’t.In the days afterwards, the explosion is named the ‘pikadon’ by survivors: “flash–bang”. However, those closest to the epicentre insist on calling it simply ‘pika’. They do not remember the boom, only the flare then an eerie silence, a moment of time caught in light like a camera flash.“I remember vividly how a stone lantern in the garden became brilliantly lit,” wrote Dr Hachiya.The atomic bomb uses light as a weapon. It converts matter into energy at the speed of light, and some of its designers had suggested sounding a “super powerful siren” before detonation, to blind anyone who looked up and happened to catch sight of the flash. The survivors were left with an unforgettable image.“That beautiful cloud! Its beauty defies description,” recalled a friend of Dr Hachiya. “I have never seen anything so magnificent in my life!”The doctor noted that “it was at the moment of the birth of this cloud, with its ever-changing colour, that Hiroshima was wiped out. It was at this moment that Hiroshima city, the culmination of many years\u0027 work, disappeared with her good citizens into the beautiful sky.”The ‘mushroom cloud’ became the bomb’s own trademark. It had to be seen to be feared. Some Manhattan Project scientists had wanted to stage demonstrations of the weapon for Japanese generals to convince them to surrender, rather than a live bombing. Hiroshima was selected partly because the damage would be “sufficiently spectacular…when publicity on it is released.” This wasn’t just an act of war, it was a media event. “There stood the Enola Gay, bathed in floodlights like the star of a Hollywood movie,” Colonel Tibbetts recalled about boarding the plane. “For the next 20 minutes we were put through a photo routine to which none of us were accustomed.” As they returned to base, tail gunner Bob Caron snapped a picture of the cloud that sprouted behind them. His would be the only official photographs successfully developed from the mission. He wrote to his mother, asking her to collect press clippings for their scrap book.The view was different from the ground.“Many times I tried to trip the shutter release but the victim would ask for pity,” one Japanese photographer said about touring the aftermath. “It was too cruel, too inhuman to ignore their pleadings.”“If I had known it was an atom bomb, I don’t think I would have ever tried taking pictures.”The strike soon developed into an information war. Initial official reports to the Japanese people were that the US had deployed a new, ‘special bomb’, but the damage was minimal. In Hiroshima, what we would now call ‘fake news’ proliferated among the survivors. Some heard that the city would be uninhabitable for 75 years. There were rumours that Japan had secretly developed its own ‘special’ bombs, and had destroyed Los Angeles among other American cities.American wanted the truth to be known, at least for now. Leaflets were dropped on potential further targets featuring Caron’s snapshot. It noted that “the atomic bomb’s horrendous destructive power can be understood by viewing this photo.” An earlier leaflet dropped on Hiroshima had warned civilians that although the targets were military, “unfortunately, bombs have no eyes.”Seventy-five years later the atomic information war is still raging, but has moved from leaflets to social media. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists warns of a general poisoning of our ‘information ecosphere’, including “sophisticated, technology-propelled propaganda” and leaders throwing doubt on scientists and “national institutions that have historically provided societal stability and cohesion.” The hacking of Twitter in July, in which accounts including American Democratic nominee Joe Biden sent out spam messages, had dark implications. President Trump, apparently not hacked, once tweeted that he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than Kim Jong Un.“I don’t think nuclear war could be started by hacking into Twitter,” says Squassoni, “but when you have the leaders of countries issuing nuclear threats on it, that’s a serious development.”Hiroshima’s after-image faded into the culture of the atomic 20th Century, the ultimate symbol of danger and progress. Children could draw the cloud\u0027s silhouette, like Mickey Mouse. It influenced everything from the nuclear-powered rage of Godzilla to the bikini swimsuit, named for nuclear tests on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.Meanwhile, Hiroshima and its people found themselves transformed into silent symbols. The mushroom cloud. The ruined dome. Kengo Nikawa’s pocket watch, stuck forever at 8.15. And for some, just their shadow, burned into the wall behind them, like a photo negative.9th August 1945. It is a cloudy day in Nagasaki. 40,000 people are blasted into memory. The original target for Fat Man, the second and so far final nuclear bomb used in warfare, was Kokura. It is skipped over due to a thick hanging fog.Meanwhile, Hiroshima is still in the shadow of the first bombing, with many survivors now living in Dr Hachiya’s hospital. A horse, burned and blind, ambles around its garden, eating the leaves of a potato patch the doctor had planted.Eleven days after the blast, more baffling symptoms become evident. People who were relatively unscathed develop speckles on their skin, then die. Another mystery: epilation.“Falling hair! This was an unusual symptom, but undeniable. Unconsciously, I grabbed some of my hair and pulled. I did not have much hair in the first place, but the amount that came out made me feel sick,” wrote Dr Hachiya.No one knows what is happening. They are in the dark.“The idea was to explode the damned thing,” recalled Hymer Friedell, who oversaw biomedical research at the Manhattan Project and later toured Hiroshima. “We weren\u0027t terribly concerned with the radiation”The world experts on the subject were now those who lived through it. Dr Hachiya noted that the closer the survivors were to the centre of the blast, the more likely they were to develop these novel symptoms, placing each patient on a map. The value of this data did not go unnoticed.Navy Secretary James Forrestal told President Truman that survivors would offer “a unique opportunity for the study of the medical and biological effects of radiation which is of utmost importance to the United States.” A legion of international scientists descended on Japan and the survivors. Reports from local doctors were collected and expanded upon. The survivors were to be studied, not necessarily treated. A cure was never an option.Many ‘hibakusha’, as they came to be known, found themselves outcasts. Their stories were censored by the American occupation, while they were shunned by society at large.“Every survivor has had a different experience,” says Takuo Takigawa, director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. “Some people didn’t want to go near them because they were ‘infected’. With others, there was a thought that they would soon die anyway.”Hibakusha were banned from public baths, for fear of contaminating the water. People refused to employ them, and certainly wouldn\u0027t marry one. The spectre of radiation exposure transformed into the idea that they were inherently sullied. Some chose to never have children.“At that time in Japan any physical deformation or injury was heavily shunned,” says Barak Kushner, professor of East Asian history at Cambridge. However, the shame extended even to those without visible injuries. “In some ways they are symbols of Japan’s failure and defeat, and of the poverty to which Japan has sunk, as it’s not able to help them. They don’t get specific compensation until years later.”Meanwhile, studies moved from the immediate aftermath to the long term. By 1950, 130,000 survivors were enrolled in what is known as the ‘Life Span Study’. It precisely surveyed where each survivor was standing relative to the blast, just as Dr Hachiya had done. Surviving hibakusha have reported for check ups right up to today.The study forms the world’s largest bank of knowledge on the effect of radiation on the human body. It is so thorough that in 1982, scientists at the Los Alamos National Lab built a replica of Little Boy – including the uranium – to better understand its findings. It helped develop safe medical uses for radiation, like CAT scans and X-rays. Nasa consulted it to help protect astronauts from cosmic radiation. Now the survey is focussing on the next generation, tracking possible effects on survivors’ children.“The rainy season officially ended yesterday,” Takigawa chuckles. “Today is a very sunny day in Hiroshima.”It is difficult to put a final number on the number killed by the attacks in 1945, given the confusion afterwards and the malignant effects of radiation, but estimates suggest more than 200,000.The rumours that Hiroshima would be uninhabitable for 75 years proved false. Both it and Nagasaki are now thriving. In 1949, a law ordered that Hiroshima be rebuilt as a “Peace Memorial City, a symbol of the ideal of making lasting peace a reality.” Despite fears over radiation, many citizens chose to stay and rebuild the city they loved. Before the war it had a population of around 350,000. Now it’s more than 2 million. The ruin of the industrial museum remains preserved at the centre, the dome cracked and open to the sky.Once forgotten and ignored by the world at large, the hibakusha became figureheads for peace movements worldwide. The Memorial Museum was established at least partly to remind the world that the victims are people, not just symbols.“The hibakusha saw it as a mission of sorts, to tell their story,” says Takigawa. “The reality of what happened, the feelings and memory, must be passed on, so people can feel the horrors of that event themselves.”The threat has not passed, for any of us. Every year since 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, first established by former Manhattan Project workers, set their ‘Doomsday Clock’ to indicate how near we are to annihilation. This year it ticked to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been. They point to the breakdown of arms control treaties a general worsening of relations between the great powers and climate change as contributing factors.“The world is sleepwalking its way through a newly unstable nuclear landscape,” the Bulletin warned. “Any belief that the threat of nuclear war has been vanquished is a mirage.”Moreover, nuclear weapons now have to compete with a wide variety of impending disasters.“They’ve fallen out of the public consciousness, but polling 20 somethings shows they actually believe they will be used in the coming decades. The younger generation is very fatalistic. However, nuclear weapons don\u0027t rise to the top of the agenda for them, whereas climate really does,” says Squassoni.After 75 years, the light from that blast has faded in the public consciousness. Simply put, we are no longer afraid of the atom bomb. Then again, neither were the people of Hiroshima.Few people live in constant fear of the newer threats Seth Baum specialises in, from artificial intelligence to designer viruses that would make coronavirus balk. They’re threats most will never have imagined, right up until the point they happen.“The last time that happened was the September 11 terrorist attack, which was low-tech, but it caught us off guard and changed how we think about the world,” says Baum. “So did coronavirus.”Takigawa says Hiroshima takes pride in teaching the world a lesson about peace, even though it had to suffer terribly for it. “There may be other ways of learning this lesson, but I can’t think of any,” he notes. In 2016, Barack Obama became the first US president to visit the site of the bombing. He gave a touching speech, paying tributes to the hibakusha and noting that “the scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.” It’s another admirable lesson, just one of many we’ve learned from Hiroshima and Nagaski: technologically, medically, politically and philosophically.Yet, fundamentally, they’re not lessons the people of Hiroshima needed to learn on 6 August 1945. We can learn from the dead. They can’t learn by dying. All they would ever know is one simple fact: that, in Obama’s words, “on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky, and the world was changed.”We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beirut blast missile may have blame says lebanons president","story":"Lebanon’s president has suggested that a missile could have been responsible for the catastrophic Beirut blast, as the country’s entrenched ruling class comes under increasing pressure from enraged citizens to resign.In a televised interview on Friday, Michel Aoun rejected calls for an international investigation into the disaster, which killed more than 150 people, saying it could have been caused by “negligence or foreign interference through a missile or bomb”.Experts have discounted the missile theory, pointing out that a fire burning at the port warehouse before the explosion was sufficient to cause the detonation of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored there.Meanwhile, the head of Hizbollah denied that his powerful Shia militant group had stored arms at the port.“We have nothing in the port: not an arms depot, nor a missile depot, nor missiles, nor rifles, nor bombs, nor bullets, nor nitrate,” Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech broadcast on Friday.Their statements will do little to dissipate public anger, with demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the government expected to be held on Saturday, following clashes between protesters and security forces on Thursday.Several people were injured in the clashes near the parliament building in downtown Beirut, where officers fired tear gas after protesters threw stones at security forces, lit fires and vandalised nearby buildings.Five British medical professionals flew out on Friday to help, after more than 5,000 people were injured in the blast, the Department for International Development said.“The UK is sending these world-leading medics to use their expertise and to make sure the people of Lebanon get the help they need as quickly as possible,” Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the International Development Secretary, said.The UK Government also announced £3 million for the British Red Cross for medical and humanitarian assistance, in addition to an earlier pledge of £5 million.But on the ground in Beirut, the failure of Lebanese leaders to take responsibility for the blast is enraging citizens, who have renewed calls advanced in nationwide protests last year for the entire government to resign.So far, only one member of parliament and the ambassador to Jordan have quit in response to the blast, which many Lebanese say was the result of decades of corruption and mismanagement. Offering her resignation in a televised address on Thursday, Tracy Chamoun, who has served as ambassador since 2017, blamed the disaster on a corrupt political elite in power since the 1975-1990 civil war.“They all must go,” Ms Chamoun said. “This is total negligence.”International leaders are also calling for widespread reform of Lebanon’s governance system. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told Lebanese citizens who mobbed him during his visit to Beirut on Thursday that international aid would not be passed into “corrupt hands”.Surrounded by demonstrators clamouring for help to oust their reviled leadership, Mr Macron said he was not there to endorse the “regime” but would ask Lebanon’s leaders to accept “a new political deal” and “to change the system”.A rare nationwide protest movement began last October, sparked by an unpopular proposal to tax the WhatsApp messaging app. Demonstrators called for the overthrow of a political oligarchy they accused of enriching itself while hollowing out the state, forcing Saad Hariri to step down as prime minister.Further unrest is expected in the coming days as Lebanese activists have called for “Saturday of Revenge” protests in Beirut this weekend.“We will hang the gallows,” read a message, accompanied by an image of a noose, on one Instagram account with 42,000 followers.“We are anticipating tens of thousands of people to protest in Beirut and other cities in Lebanon on Saturday,” said Joel Gulhane, an analyst with the UK-based Risk Advisory Group.“We are likely to see a return to the earlier days of the protest movement that began in October,” he added. “But the anger and devastation wrought by the explosion, coupled with the sharp decline in quality of life … means that the upcoming period is likely to be more violent than before.”     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germans dont worship health service better","story":"In judging our Covid-19 performance, we naturally compare it with that of other countries. The most telling comparison is with nations whose predicament is closest to ours. Enormous countries, such as China, Brazil and the US, are not closely comparable. Nor are much poorer countries, or more thinly populated ones.The natural comparisons are Western European, and even here, there are important differences. The Scandinavian countries, with their small, well-extended populations, are not so close to the British experience, although we should learn from their medical systems. The nearest comparisons, surely, are quite densely populated neighbours with roughly similar populations and GDP, urban concentrations and large international airports. That means France, Italy, Germany and, perhaps, Spain.The eventual Covid-19 post-mortem will no doubt unearth mistakes that are uniquely British, but if you look at the story so far, you will see that neither Britain, France, Italy, or Spain has done markedly better than one another. In deaths per million of the population – a more meaningful comparator than total numbers – we, at 684, are the worst of these four but the others are bad too (Italy 582, France 462. Plucky little Belgium, by the way, seems to be the world’s worst, at 851). The only one in a different league is Germany, at 110.Why might this be? First, Germany had the “luck” to get an early case of the coronavirus. A female business traveller from Shanghai arrived on January 16 and fell ill with the virus. She was treated at the Munich Schwabing Hospital. A consequent cluster of 16 cases was identified. On February 13, at the country’s Science Media Centre, a huge press conference reported the scientific findings in detail. The press release warned that “every day the spread is not controlled, the likelihood that the epidemic will develop into a pandemic increases”.But the mere fact of a disease being identified does not mean the authorities know what to do about it. The Germans did. I am no expert on Germany, but here are a few factors.Expertise. The Munich hospital has a special unit for highly contagious life-threatening infections. Its chief physician spoke at the press conference. So did the professor who had developed one of the first tests for Covid-19, as did the president of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, the government’s public health institute. Lockdown was quicker than in Britain, but less draconian and more targeted.Testing (mainly for flu) is a more established part of life in Germany than in Britain. It has gone on apace throughout Covid. Also, where the NHS closed down, the normal German health system kept going. Patients with Covid were not, as they were here, told to stay at home unaided. They were constantly monitored. If their oxygen levels dropped too low, they were admitted to hospital. The needs of care homes were not ignored. No patient was sent to a care home unless it could provide 14 days’ quarantine.Media. Far more German journalists are well acquainted with science than are their British counterparts. They give the public clearer facts and fewer scare stories.Dispersal. Unlike Britain, Germany is a country of many different centres, with associated airports – Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt and so on, rather than London, London and more London. So there was less danger of a sudden explosion of the plague.A related fact is that the country is federal. Sixteen states, rather than the central government, are responsible for most aspects of health care. This sometimes slows things down, but it also means that, compared with Britain, there is more local “buy-in”, more local players who get going, rather than waiting upon a distant bureaucracy.This creates a good spread of service across Germany. There were plenty of labs for testing, for example, in plenty of places. There was no appalling rush. When Britain finally got round to test and trace, the Government commissioned Serco to run it from a single call centre in Scotland. As the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, points out, you are more likely to comply with tracing from a knowledgeable employee of your county council than a call from a student hundreds of miles away. In Germany, the “corona-detectors” are a respected body of local experts.Good politics. Many in Britain have grown rather fed up with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, what with her ambiguous speeches and her hostility to Brexit. Her star has gradually waned even at home. Nevertheless, she is a scientist by training and an experienced, steady person. She can command respect in the crisis, precisely because she is not, in any detailed sense, in charge of Covid policy. Rather than having to pretend she has all the answers, she can exercise moral authority.Mrs Merkel is in this enviable position because – astonishing to British eyes – she runs a country in which health care is not usually high on the list of political controversies. In Britain, the health secretary – currently Matt Hancock – has to run all hospitals and the fifth largest workforce in the world. At the same time, he has to spend days in the House of Commons being assailed by accusations that he is trying to “sell off” the NHS and similar nonsense. The German health minister (an able man called Jens Spahn) has infinitely less power, but – no offence to Mr Hancock – can do more practical good. His role has not been to try to run a vast, unmanageable empire, but simply to oil the wheels of a system which already works, by putting in more government money – covering the costs of testing, and paying for ICU beds to be kept available.Why is Germany free of what Mr Hunt calls “the political poison” of our system? Not because Germans don’t care about health – they actually spend a higher proportion of their GDP on it than we do, and they have better health outcomes. It is because they have never bought the doctrine that a particular health care system is sacred.The origins of good health care for ordinary Germans lie in mutual funds in the 19th century, set up to help pay for funerals. These developed into much more sophisticated, competing systems of health insurance, underwritten by the state, but not run by it. Employer and employee both contribute. An unemployed person has his health care paid for in his unemployment insurance. Almost no German citizen falls through the net.The providers are also various. Government-run hospitals are outnumbered by privately run ones and others run by charities (many, for instance by the Order of St John). Because the money follows the patient, the providers have good incentives to provide. Indeed, the problem in Germany is too many hospital beds.In Britain, the health service is an object of high emotion. Behind the praise often lies a fear that it is precarious. In Germany, there is little emotional commitment to the service – rather as, here, there is little intense feeling for Sainsbury’s or Waitrose. Instead of high emotion, there is a high level of confidence. This may help explain why so many more Germans than British have returned to work, although Covid numbers jump upwards from time to time. Psychologically and medically, the German way is better for the national health than is the thing we call the National Health Service.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden issues clarification second gaffe week polls begin","story":"Joe Biden has walked back comments he made about the African-American community following his second gaffe in a week as his poll lead over Donald Trump narrows.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee issued a three-tweet clarification on Thursday evening after remarks he made in an interview triggered a backlash. Mr Biden made the comment in passing when asked about normalising relations with Cuba during a conversation with a panel of journalists. “And by the way, what you all know but most people don\u0027t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly erse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things,” he said. “You go to Florida you find a very different attitude about immigration in certain places than you do when you\u0027re in Arizona. So it\u0027s a very different, a very erse community.”His suggestion that there was a lack of ersity among the African-American community was jumped on by the Trump campaign, which widely shared footage of the remark. Mr Biden responded with a public statement posted on his official Twitter account which attempted to clean up the message his comments had conveyed. “Earlier today, I made some comments about ersity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith - not by identity, not on issues, not at all,” he said. It is the second time this week Mr Biden’s conversations with journalists have led to a backlash. Earlier he had given a heated response when asked if he had taken a cognitive test. No, I haven\u0027t taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man,” Mr Biden said. The issue has arisen after Mr Trump challenged him to take a test. He went on: “That\u0027s like saying to you, before you got on this program if you had taken a test were you taking cocaine or not. What do you think, huh? Are you a junkie?The trip-ups show the political dangers in Mr Biden’s engagement with the media, which is expected to increase markedly after the political conventions later this month. The former US vice president, now 77, developed a reputation for gaffes during his eight years working under Barack Obama, then the US president. The Trump campaign had been ruthlessly attacking his verbal trip-ups, with senior figures calling into question his mental acuity via tweets, adverts and interview remarks. Mr Biden retains a sizable lead over Mr Trump in national polls, but the lead has begun to narrow in the last fortnight. According to a poll tracker by Real Clear Politics, which takes an average of national polls, Mr Biden was around nine points ahead in late July but is now around 6 points ahead. The Democratic and Republican conventions are held in back-to-back weeks later this month, with the presidential election held on November 3. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden make consequential vp pick us history","story":"If Joe Biden wins in November and remembers where he left the car keys on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2021, he will be 78 years old when he enters the White House. The chances of him being carried out by the handles soon afterwards are high. The average American male lives for 78.54 years, and the presidency, a 247 crisis conducted in multiple time zones, can tip even sprightly joggers like George W. Bush and Barack Obama into haggard, Tony Blair-like decrepitude.This is why Biden’s nominee for the vice-presidency might be the most consequential since JFK picked Lyndon Johnson in 1960 and Richard Nixon picked Gerald Ford in 1972. At least Kennedy and Nixon expected to serve out their four years. Given Biden’s rumoured cognitive decline, his running mate may have a strong chance of inheriting the top job.The smart money had the Californian Congresswoman Karen Bass in the running for the running-mate nomination. But this week the offense archaeologists went to work and dug up Bass’s not-so-smart approval of Cuban communism, the Church of Scientology, and the Nation of Islam. So the Democratic vice-presidential nomination is not, as the noted political analyst Meghan Trainor predicted, going to be all about the Bass.The even smarter money now banks on two candidates: another Californian, Senator Kamala Harris, who is a smart and experienced election-winner and Susan Rice, a Democratic diplomat and advisor who has never held elected office and has, even more smartly, kept herself almost as invisible in recent weeks as Biden himself.Only the very smartest will have noticed that what Bass, Harris and Rice have in common is that they are all what CNN now calls “iniduals with a cervix”. It might be smart not to state the obvious, that they are all also People of Color. But that depends on who does the stating. A Republican would be a dog-whistling racist, incapable of seeing past skin color. A Democrat would be a proud progressive, so color-blind that he or she can see the need to correct the party’s historic complicity with Caucasity.The bipartisan truth is that the Democratic Party runs on a combination of the higher tokenism and the lower nepotism: pandering to politically-correct symbolism while propping up their big-city machine politics. Although both parties’ candidates for November’s elections are led by septuagenarians – the Golfer-in-Chief is a perky 74 – this makes it easy to distinguish the Democrats from the Republicans, for they run on a combination of the lower tokenism and the higher nepotism: pandering to angry and disenfranchised small-town whites while favoring the big-money donors.The media, unusually, have a bipartisan consensus about Kamala Harris. Left or right, left behind or right over the edge, they all loathe her. The right see her as a Title IX candidate, exploiting affirmative action on the inside track: in 2003, when she ran for state district attorney, her then-boyfriend Willie Brown, the mayor of San Francisco, campaigned and raised money for her. The left hate her for being an effective prosecutor, and hence having contributed to the imprisonment of African American men.When Harris won that 2003 race, she became the first African American DA in California’s history. Like Barack Obama, she broke the racial glass ceiling on a technicality. Her mother is a Tamil from India, who immigrated into the United States to study endocrinology. Her father is an economist from Jamaica who immigrated in 1961. Harris identifies as African American, and given the skin-deep madness of race in America, it makes sense. But her background as a child of the upper-middle professional class, like her background, are highly atypical of African American experience.The same goes for Susan Rice, to a lesser extent. Her mother was the daughter of Jamaican immigrants who became a scholar of educational policy. Her father was an Ivy League economist who became the second black governor of the Federal Reserve. Her parents orced when she was ten, and when she was fourteen, her mother remarried a white government attorney. Subtract sex and skin color, admittedly the most important criteria in American public life these days, and Rice is a born Swamp creature.Rice is uncharismatic, and somewhat haunted by the fact that, as an advisor to Bill Clinton, her response to the Rwandan genocide of 1994 was to ask, “If we use the word ‘genocide’ and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November election?” Biden’s team, who appear to be agonising over their pick, must be wondering the same thing now. They also face the problem of having to find a vice-presidential nominee who can convince the voters that Biden will be in safe hands, but who doesn’t appear so competent that she shows up his frailties, perhaps by answering questions clearly and without deviation, repetition and pained silences.On those terms, Harris will be a serious challenger to Biden, as well as to Trump. She would be a law and order candidate, running after unprecedented disorder in Democratic-run cities. Her skin color will permit white suburbanites, especially the female suburban voters that Trump is already struggling to retain, to vote for law and order without feeling guilty. If Biden wins, Harris has an excellent chance of becoming America’s first female president.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new magaluf lake district became go to destination party loving","story":"While Brits behaving badly abroad is nothing new, in the summer of Covid-19 it seems our chickens have come home to roost. Ally Kohler, the director for conservation and communities at Dartmoor National Park Authority, visited the site a week or so ago and was reduced to tears by what she encountered – rubbish strewn across the moor, 50 or so fire pits potentially made out of stones taken from archaeological sites nearby, and every gorse bush used as a makeshift toilet. I used to take my family to this site to picnic, and there is no way I would take them now, she says.

Travel through London City Airport, already a speedy process, has been further streamlined, with social distancing measures, additional cleaning and temperature checks implemented to embed confidence and improve hygiene.Any remaining jitters about being in Ibiza dissipated as soon as I saw those immersive cerulean waters and boundless, clear blue skies. there seemed to be some respite for islanders, so many of whom rely entirely on tourism to make a living.Read the full story.Travellers willing to take the plunge and head to Europe will find some remarkably cheap air fares and packages, writes Oliver Smith.  Cases remain low in Italy, and flights to Milan next week are available for as little at £9 (one-way) with Wizz Air.

It is essential for people to travel with valid travel insurance to avoid huge pay outs should an unexpected incident occur either before or during a trip.”Malta has banned mass gatherings and made it mandatory to wear masks in public today as new Covid-19 cases surged after having been reduced to zero for a week in early July.Health authorities reported 49 new infections today, the second highest daily number since the first case was detected on March 7.

This comes into effect on Saturday.Meanwhile, bars and restaurants in Norway may no longer serve alcohol after midnight,Lee Hunt, managing director of travel agent Deben Travel, said that he had no bookings to France on his books.“They all cancelled a while back,” he said.  “This week we have booked just three holidays, all for 2021.“What we could call the ‘lates market’ is non-existent, people just do not want to take the risk it seems.“To put those three bookings into context, we would usually this time of year have six staff members booking at least 10 holidays per day.”Hunt said consumer confidence needs to return before travellers will book trips again. “We need the Foreign Office advice against ocean cruising lifted as soon as possible and more air corridors.At present, British holidaymakers enjoy the benefits of the reciprocal health – or EHIC – ­arr­angement, which entitles UK citizens to medical care using the public health system in all EU countries, plus a few other non-EU members such as Switzerland and Norway.  Travel\u0027s consumer editor, Nick Trend, had hoped that we could hold onto this agreement after Brexit, but the latest signs could suggest otherwise. It’s an excellent and sensible scheme, and it especially benefits older travellers and those who are at higher risk of needing ­urgent medical care. I have warned that we may lose it as a result of Brexit but have clung on to the hope that it will be included as part of the final trade deal.The latest signals from Government are not encouraging, however. It is seeming more and more likely that we will end the transition period on Dec 31 without such a deal.

The move comes just six weeks after a nationwide easing of such measures.Spain has registered 310,000 registered Covid-19 infections and 28,500 deaths as was taken off the UK travel green list on July 25.People who arrive in the Australian state of New South Wales from neighbouring Victoria will have to go into mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine from today.The new measures have been introduced in answer to a rise in coronavirus infections in Victoria.All returning New South Wales residents, unless they live within the state\u0027s border regions, will only be allowed to return via Sydney Airport.Comment: Australia\u0027s hysterical response to this pandemic is downright bonkersThe First Minister has announced that the Government is expanding the list of indoor venues in which people must wear a face covering. From tomorrow, the list will include libraries, museums and places of worship, she said.The Scottish Government is also updated its guidance on face visors.After reviewing scientific evidence, Sturgeon said they are not convinced that face visors provide sufficient protection to the wearer of others, so they must be worn with another type of face covering.Britons who\u0027ve booked a holiday to a travel corridor country face much uncertainty as to whether their destination could be added to quarantine list.Spain, Serbia, Belgium, Luxembourg and Andorra are now among the countries to see quarantine reimposed for travel to the UK.However, flights and train services to Europe continue in spite of changes to FCO advice, says Rory Boland, travel editor at the consumer association, Which?We have previously reported on tourists being refused entry to Greece due to tracking code delays, now  Travel\u0027s Annabel Fenwick Elliott has been caught up in the chaos. I should be in Greece by now. Instead I was turned away at the British Airways check-in desk at Heathrow yesterday.Why? Because the ‘track and trace’ QR code one now needs to enter the country had not arrived in time, despite my having an email confirmation from the Greek authorities that said (or seemed to say) that I would be permitted to board.I wasn’t the only one. An uneasy queue was assembling at the supervisor’s desk of the airline at around 8am in the morning when I arrived to check in for my 10.10 flight to Santorini. Children were crying. Parents were pacing, phones were ringing, sheets of paper clutched in fists. Read the full story.Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that hospitality businesses will now be required to collect and hold customer details, with the rule coming into effect from next Friday.It was previously in the guidelines for businesses to do this, however it will now be on a statutory footing.The new statutory guidance relating to indoor hospitality will be set out in more detail next week, she said.People should also book tables in advance, there should be no queuing and there should be seating with table service, she added. There should also be no background music or television so that customers don\u0027t need to shout and risk spreading the virus. Wearing face masks will be made compulsory outdoors from August 8 to August 30 in parts of Marseille, France\u0027s second-largest city, in an effort contain the spread of the coronavirus, local authorities said today.France has seen a surge in new COVID-19 cases over the past 10 days and Paris is expected to announce similar measures in coming days.In the past seven days, almost all adults (96 per cent) who had left their homes said they had worn a face covering to slow the spread of the coronavirus – up from 84 per cent last week and 71 per cent the week before.ONS figures show that the proportion of people wearing face coverings outside of their homes varies between England, Scotland and Wales, although all three countries have seen an increase in the reporting of face coverings being worn over the past five weeks.The face mask rules in your favourite European holiday destinationsThe cruise industry has been hit hard by the coronaviurs pandemic with cruise holidays still banned across many countries - the UK Foreign Office maintains a ban on all cruises, with the exemption of river sailings.  However, demand for cruises on smaller ships is on the up, writes Benjamin Parker.Edwina Lonsdale, managing director of Mundy Cruising, told The  that in the past month, 90 per cent of ocean-going bookings had been for ships carrying fewer than 1,000 passengers, and demand is high for European river cruises on ships carrying no more than 160.But this isn’t a knee-jerk reaction to coronavirus what we are seeing is a long-term pivot of future patterns.The resurrection of Swan Hellenic exemplifies this shift. The original line ceased trading in 2017, but its return in late 2021 was announced last month. While its ships only ever carried a few hundred passengers, its new vessels will take around 150 on voyages.Read the full story.A melting glacier is at risk of breaking apart due to a heatwave, forcing the evacuation of part of an Italian alpine valley, reports Reuters.The alarm was raised on Wednesday when experts in helicopters realised that the Planpincieux glacier, at an altitude of about 2,800 metres in the Ferret Valley in the Mont Blanc massif, was slipping dangerously.A heatwave has created a layer of water under the glacier, which is roughly the size of the Milan cathedral, making it more prone to a break.About 75 residents and tourists in homes or hotels in hamlets in the threatened part of the valley were evacuated and police threw up roadblocks to prevent others from entering.The route between London City airport and Vilnius will resume on August 31, with flights co-funded by the Lithuanian government.Flights between Vilnius and London City were launched in May 2019 but had to be suspended as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.The route will start with 12 flights a week.The Department for Transport has released a statement on the quarantine rules for Belgium, offering some clarity for motorists. It says:If you travelled from Germany or the Netherlands through Belgium, unless all passengers remained in the car and no-one got out or in for the entire time while transiting through Belgium, you need to self-isolate.Those arriving in the UK on a rail journeys that includes a stop in Belgium will also need to self-isolate unless no new passengers boarded the train.As such, Eurostar passengers travelling from Amsterdam to London will need to self-isolate because the journey as includes a change in Brussels.The Pakistani authorities will permit the re-opening of restaurants, cafes, cinemas, beauty parlors and public parks on Monday, facilities which have been shut since March 16.International travel will also return to normal, with social distancing rules implemented.The National Coordination Committee has taken the decision to relax restrictions after the number of new daily cases has plummeted from a peak of over 6,800 in June to fewer than 1,000 in August.British regional airline Eastern Airways is set to launch a brand-new route from Teesside Airport in the North East to Heathrow, reports The Points Guy.The route, which will be operated by 76-seater Embraer 170, has its inaugural flight scheduled for 14 September.The flight is scheduled to arrive into and depart from Heathrow Terminal 2, however, this could change when Heathrow terminals 3 and 4 reopen.From September 14, the airline will operate four flights a week, building this up gradually until the week of  5 October when there will be a once-daily flight.Britons hoping to book a last minute overseas holiday could do well to take a look at where infection are rising across Europe. Belgium has one of the highest rates in Europe at 49.2 per 100,000 people (in the UK it is 14.3 per 100,000). In France, for comparison, the number is 23.4 per 100,000. We\u0027ve crunched the numbers to see which country could be the next addition to the UK\u0027s red list.People travelling to south west England are being asked to avoid busy beaches over the weekend. Crowds are expected to flock to the coast as temperatures are forecast to rise to 37C in some areas of the country.The RNLI has called on beachgoers to follow water safety advice and adhere to social distancing. Kitty Norman, water safety delivery support at the RNLI, said: The beaches across the whole of the South West are extremely busy at the moment with both locals who are holidaying at home this year and an influx of visitors to the region. The sheer volume of people making social distancing tricky is one thing to be conscious of before planning your trip to the beach.The charity carried out 30 rescues in one day on a single beach in Cornwall last week. These mostly involved swimmers and body boarders caught in rip currents, going out of their depth and being cut off by the incoming tide.Health Secretary Matt Hancock is to give an update on whether further steps need to be taken to stamp out rising cases in parts of the country. It follows the news that Preston council has told its residents to start following the same restrictions that Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire are following, after official figures showed a spike in cases. Preston City Council chief executive Adrian Phillips told the BBC: We are not waiting for some Government announcement.Follow the coronavirus live blog for more.The BBC\u0027s Jessica Parker reports that if you travelled from Germany or the Netherlands through Belgium you need to self-isolate unless all passengers remained in the car and no one got in or out for the entire journey through Belgium. You also need to self-isolate if new passengers got in the car.Little Belgium is a quarter the size of England and has one-fifth of the population, but it has the unenviable record of the world’s highest Covid-related death toll per capita, writes  Travel\u0027s Belgium expert Antony Mason.Belgium\u0027s was already marked, you might say, but it was really the uptick in new cases since mid-July that has led Britain (second in that death-toll-per-million league table, by the way) to strike Belgium off the “green list” of countries exempt from 14-day quarantine rule for travellers coming into the UK. This is a blow to the Belgians, but not altogether a surprise. Faced with rising figures, their government recently reversed some of the “deconfinement rules”, for instance reducing from ten to five the number of people from outside one’s family social bubble that each person is allowed to meet per week.Belgium went into lockdown at about the same time as the UK, on March 17, with somewhat stricter measures. In these early days, news footage showing uniformed police confronting lone people sitting in the spring sunshine in public places had the air of Tintin-esque absurdity. Now the Belgians are relieved that in general the lockdown has been considerably eased: life seems to be getting back to normal – regardless of what the British think and do.Read the full story. Poland has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown after it reported 809 new coronavirus infections today, the sixth record daily rise in two weeks.According to the health ministry’s Twitter account, most of the cases were in and around big cities including the capital Warsaw, Katowice and Krakow.The conservative nationalist government has imposed stricter sanitary rules on a number of Polish counties, which include compulsory wearing of protective face masks outside the home.It has banned conferences, sport events and concerts, closed cinemas and gyms, and imposed a 50-person limit on the number of people taking part in weddings though churches and hotels remain open.The Mexican coastal city of Acapulco has pulled two controversial video adverts that touted the faded resort\u0027s reputation as an anything goes tourism destination as they weren\u0027t appropriate during the coronavirus pandemic.The governor of the Pacific coast state of Guerrero quickly criticized the adverts, in which tourists are shown going to parties, pools and nightclubs without face masks or social distancing.We have stopped being a postcard from the past, today we have changed the rules, says a voice-over narration in one of the videos.In fact, there are no rules, says another voice, as people can be seen eating meals and going out to nightclubs. As three more countries are added to the UK\u0027s quarantine list, which destinations are your best bet for a last-minute summer holiday? Malta is believed to be in the Government’s crosshairs, with its 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents currently reading 33 (it is 14.3 for the UK). Visitors to France (23.4), The Netherlands (24) and the Czech Republic (27.8) may be wary, while Sweden (29.7) and Portugal (26.3) are still being snubbed by the FCO. Nevertheless, there is a clutch of countries with far fewer cases should you fancy a last-minute holiday: Italy: 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 residents: 6.2Greece: 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 residents: 8.4Denmark: 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 residents: 14.4Norway: 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 residents: 5.8Slovakia: 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 residents: 6.6Estonia: 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 residents: 6.6Latvia: 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 residents: 3.1We suggest where to stay in each country.British Airways has begun telling thousands of staff whether they will lose their jobs as the airline presses on with painful restructuring of operations in response to coronavirus.Cabin and ground crew will be asked to sign up to steep pay cuts, while others will be told that they have been made redundant.A third group will keep their jobs on pre-Covid terms and conditions.More than 6,000 staff have applied for voluntary redundancy, the airline said.Read the full report.Despite imposing the longest, strictest lockdown in Southeast Asia, coronavirus cases in the Philippines have now surged to almost 120,000, eclipsing Indonesia to become the region’s biggest outbreak.The country imposed a second lockdown on Manila and nearby areas to curb the spread of infections.After enduring a strict lockdown from mid-March to the end of May, the Philippines re-opened its capital although new cases were still growing by up to a thousand every day.As people returned to offices and families gathered again, infections surged 500 per cent in over two months of easing before the government re-imposed a lockdown this week.The mercury is rising in the UK with temperatures set to reach 37C in some parts of the country this weekend.According to the Met office, the heatwave could last until Sunday. This would mean that parts of Britain could pass the threshold for an \u0027official heatwave\u0027, which requires three days of temperatures over 25C (77F) in different parts of the country.While it may be ideal staycation weather, not everyone finds it easy to cope with such heat. Alice Hall offers eight ways to cope in high temperatures.A couple claimed an early spot on the beach in Margate this morningIndia has seen another large jump in new cases, registering a record daily jump of 62,538 coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours.The rise takes the country’s total to 2.03 million, the health ministry said.The country became the third nation to record more than 2 million cases of the virus, behind the United States and Brazil, as infections spread further to smaller towns and rural areas.The US State department has issued an advisory to citizens to not travel to Mexico, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for the country.On Thursday, the US lifted a global Level 4 health advisory, which had been in place since March 19, that guided US citizens to avoid all international travel.Portugal has launched its own brand of coronavirus travel insurance designed to attract British holidaymakers to a country still deemed unsafe by the UK Government.Portugal Travel Insurance, a joint venture by the national tourist board and RNA Assistance Insurance, covers “medical, surgical, pharmaceutical and hospital expenses associated with Covid-19.It also extends to the cost of cancellation, interruption or extension of travel due to the pandemic. “The goal is to ensure all visitors to Portugal that they can travel around the country safely and with confidence,” Turismo de Portugal said in a statement.  Starting from €37.20 (£33.50), the insurance offers “complete coverage for unforeseen situations”.Portugal has twice been excluded from the UK’s ‘safe’ list, due to its high rate of coronavirus infections, but the country maintains that its numbers are both low and superior to those of the UK. Any travel to Portugal currently would invalidate most travel insurance policies and requie a two-week quarantine on return to the UK.Hong Kong is to offer free Covid-19 testing for residents, leader Carrie Lam said today.The plan will enable citywide testing for the first time and is likely to be implemented in a fortnight at the earliest, Lam said.The Chinese territory saw a surge in locally-transmitted coronavirus cases at the start of July and introduced a raft of tightening measures, including restricting gatherings to two people and making wearing face masks mandatory in all outdoor public spaces.Britain will not hesitate to add more countries to its quarantine list, finance minister Rishi Sunak said today when asked about whether France could join Spain on the list.If we need to take action as you\u0027ve seen overnight we will of course not hesitate to do that, Sunak told Sky News.He added: We are doing that to protect people\u0027s health but in the meantime people should just continue to look at the guidance and make a decision and take everything into account themselves and make a decision that they think is best. A tourist has broken the toes off a 200-year-old Italian sculpture. The man, now identified as Austrian, was posing for a photograph on the statue when the accident happened.The 19th century sculpture by artist Antonio Canova is a plaster cast model, with the marble statue version in Rome.It\u0027s peak holiday season in Kyoto and scores of international tourists would usually be flocking to its famous temples and filling the city’s hotels, restaurants and souvenir shops.Yet streets are empty, shops are closed and hotels are struggling to survive as the pandemic shuts out visitors and ravages the economy. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had sought to revive local economies with an influx of foreign tourists as part of his “Abenomics” stimulus policy. The target was to lure 40 million overseas visitors per year and since the launch of Abenomics in late 2012, the number of overseas visitors rose steadily to exceed 30 million last year, triple the level in 2013.Over 2.7 million visited Japan in January but as the country closed its borders to contain the virus, the flow trickled to a meagre 2,600 in June.The British Museum is set to reopen its doors to visitors on August 27.The London venue will have been shut for 163 days by the time it welcomes back visitors, which is the longest peacetime closure in its 261-year history.Visits to the museum will need to be pre-booked and a one-way route will be installed around some of its galleries.The Dutch Prime Minister has asked tourists to avoid busy parts of Amsterdam, following a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases in the Netherlands.Prime Minister Mark Rutte cut short his summer vacation after the National Institute for Health (RIVM) reported 601 new cases on Thursday, from 426 a day earlier, following weeks of gradual increases.“Very specifically for the city of Amsterdam, I say to tourists foreign and domestic, and partly on behalf of the mayor: avoid the busy parts of the city,” Rutte told reporters in The Hague.Amsterdam’s mayor Femke Halsema began mandating masks in popular areas of the city on Wednesday.With Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas off the green list, the holiday map is shrinking. These are the countries that Britons can currently travel to without restriction. Faroe Islands (Visitors required to take Covid-19 test at airport on arrival)Iceland (Open to tourists, but all arrivals must choose to pay to be tested for coronavirus or self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Children born in 2005 or later are exempt)Mapped: The 26 countries you can actually visit right nowThe US announced last night that it is lifting a global health advisory imposed in March that advised American citizens to avoid all international travel because of the coronavirus pandemic.With health and safety conditions improving in some countries and potentially deteriorating in others, the department is returning to our previous system of country-specific levels of travel advice, the State Department said in a statement.Parts of Europe, Africa and Asia are now listed at Level 3, for “reconsider travel,” while New Zealand, which has essentially eradicated the virus, is listed at Level 2, for “exercise increased caution.” China, which has largely brought the virus under control, is still listed as Level 4 -- for “‘do not travel -- because of “travel and quarantine restrictions,” according to the State Department website.France’s weekly rate has overtaken that of Portugal, which has reduced its coronavirus cases to the extent that ministers are considering lifting the travel ban on it next week and allowing flights to the country and its islands of the Azores and Madeira.Government sources stressed there was no imminent decision on France as it recorded its highest daily number of new Covid-19 cases in two months, with 1,695 positive tests, slightly fewer than the 1,772 seen in Spain.Read the full story.Before we turn to the latest news, here were the biggest travel stories yesterday:France records two-month high in new cases Switzerland, Norway and Finland

upcoming Fifa 21 football simulation game in an effort to reduce toxicity among players.The “shushing” celebration is being taken out amid concerns that players use it to gloat and stall kick-offs after scoring.Also being removed, according to Eurogamer, is the “A-OK” celebration, which features a gesture which has ties to the white supremacist movement.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCall of Duty: Modern Warfare also recently removed the “OK” gesture from its list of emotes, amid fears that the signal could be used to communicate racist sentiments.In a media call, Fifa 21‘s lead gameplay producer Sam Rivera said: “We were told by the community that there’s toxic behaviours in the game and we wanted to make sure we removed them.RIP box sets: How streaming lets classic TV slip through the cracksWhy all the fuss over a same-sex kiss on CBBC?How Ellen DeGeneres came to be accused of enabling a toxic workplace“So we removed some of the celebrations that people thought were not the best idea to have in the game.”While the changes were made to curb offensive behaviour, there were also practical reasons behind the changes.Said Rivera: ”The flow is shorter, which is to try to keep you playing most of the time instead of just waiting. All together the intention there is just to keep you playing instead of doing other things that may not be necessary in the game.”Fifa 21 is going to other lengths to reduce wasted time while playing multiplayer games, including the removed of the “walk back” animation that sees players return to the centre circle, and the time given to take set pieces has been scaled back from 30 seconds to 10, 12, 15 and 20, for kick-offs, throw-ins, goal kicks and free kicks, respectively.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The numbers of new coronavirus cases may be starting to level off, a survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested.After analysing data from nearly 120,000 swab tests, an estimated 28,300 people in England were projected to have had Covid-19 during the week from 27 July to 2 August. This equates to about one person in every 1,900.Although this is higher than the lowest estimate at the end of June, the trend appears to be heading back down again after creeping steadily up throughout July.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the previous week, an estimated 35,700 people had the virus, or about one person in every 1,500.The ONS testing survey is carried out separately to the NHS Test and Trace scheme and aims to work out the true extent of how much coronavirus is circulating within the population.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolThe households taking part in the survey were tested for Covid-19 regardless of whether they had symptoms or not.During the week ending on 2 August, there was about 3,700 new cases of coronavirus a day in England – like the total number of cases, this incidence rate is higher than in June but also appears to be levelling off again.Despite the positive news, the ONS cautions against placing too much weight on their findings. Their estimates of the prevalence of the virus across the whole of England are based on just 53 positive tests in their 120,000 sample and there is a degree of uncertainty about how to extrapolate from their data to the whole population.Local spikes of the virus in places including Leicester, Blackburn and now Greater Manchester and Aberdeen have led to more restrictive local lockdowns in recent weeks, but the ONS survey suggests there is no evidence coronavirus is more prevalent in different regions of England.Again, this is partly due to the small sample sizes of people from each region which make it statistically difficult to estimate regional infection rates.Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result, Sage does not have confidence that R is currently below 1 in England.”The estimates for R and growth rate are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a subgroup of Sage.It said: “We are starting to see early indications that these values may be increasing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This equates to about one person in every 1,900.Although this is higher than the lowest estimate at the end of June, the trend appears to be heading back down again after creeping steadily up throughout July.In the previous week, an estimated 35,700 people had the virus, or about one person in every 1,500.Meanwhile, statisticians at the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, which feeds information directly to the SPI-M, said on Thursday the R value was now likely to be close to 1 in most regions, with the southwest potentially above 1, although the low number of overall infections makes it difficult to be accurate about the spread of the disease.Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The first movie was released in 2014, with sequels following in 2017 and 2019.From Avatar 2 to Mulan: Every delayed film and their new release dateIn May, creator Derek Kolstad revealed that the original film got its title because Reeves kept referring to it by the wrong name. It was originally meant to be called Scorn.“The only reason it’s called John Wick is that Keanu kept referring to it as John Wick,” Kolstad said.“Marketing was like, ‘Dude, that’s four to five million dollars in free advertising so far, so it’s John Wick instead of Scorn.

In other words, expect incredible scenes akin to the one in Inception that sees Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s character fight in a hotel corridor while floating around in zero gravity.Why do people think Tenet is related to Inception? Firstly, numerous Reddit posts have predicted that the tech featured in the new film could be the same that is used by Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and company for their mission. It would be no stretch to assume that the agency who provides them with the devices they use to “incept” people also supplies Washington and Robert Pattinson‘s characters with what they need to complete their job in the new film.As is the norm with Nolan films, Michael Caine will once again return for a small role in Tenet. Interestingly, though, some are wondering whether he will be reprising the role of Professor Stephen Miles, Cobb’s father-in-law in Inception.In that film, he serves to help fill the viewers in on Cobb’s situation, and considering Tenet‘s plot seems just as intricate, it would be a good idea to reintroduce him for this reason alone. Moreover, it would undoubtedly excite fans if they were to be given an update on Cobb, not to mention whether or not that spinning top fell or not in Inception’s closing moments (even though Caine claimed to know the answer to this years ago).Regardless, it remains outrageous to think that Tenet will be a direct sequel to Inception, but – if there is any relation at all – it will surely be that the two are set in the same universe. Backing this up is Washington, who described the film as “an in-law” to Inception.Other factors adding to people’s theories have been generated thanks to the film’s distributor, Warner Bros.Bosses have been insistent on releasing Tenet this year despite numerous high-profile film releases being shifted to 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. Tenet, which was originally set to be unveiled in July, has remained on the release schedules the entire time, leading some to question whether this was fuelled by the knowledge that it coincided with Inception’s 10th anniversary.Also, adding fuel to the fire is the fact that Inception is getting re-released before Tenet. While mainly being a ploy to lure people back into cinemas now lockdown guidelines have been lifted, it would also be a clever tactic to familiarise future Tenet viewers with the events of a film it could have several links to.Our prediction is that Tenet will be its own film – yet another ambitious project from the mind of Nolan. Depending on where you are in the world, you will all be able to draw your own conclusions once the film is finally released in Europe on 26 August.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Baroness Lawrence, Sir Keir Starmer’s race relations adviser, pointed to new analysis by Labour which suggests that inner city areas with much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations have among the highest rates of furloughed staff. Workers in these areas could be at a higher risk of redundancy later this year, the party warns. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from the House of Commons library shows that nine of the sixteen parliamentary constituencies with the highest take-up rate of the furlough scheme also have much higher than average black, Asian and minority ethnic populations.  They include Tottenham, in London, where the figures show half of the population is from a Bame community and 39 per cent of those eligible have been furloughed. Baroness Lawrence said: “This pandemic has already had a disproportionate impact on the health of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in this country, and now there is mounting evidence that they will be hit hardest by the economic impact too. “The government must support black, Asian and ethnic minority communities by introducing a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors. “If we are going to effectively address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 we must eradicate the systemic inequalities that it thrives on.”  In April Sir Keir appointed Baroness Lawrence as his race relations adviser and asked her to lead a review into the effect of the coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. The Labour peer, whose son Stephen Lawrence was killed as he waited at a bus stop in 1993, is expected to publish her report later this year.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMinisters also confirmed that the current restrictions on gatherings in Greater Manchester, Leicester, parts of West Yorkshire and East Lancashire will remain in place.Wider restrictions in Leicester, Blackburn and Bradford will also continue. England coronavirus R rate could be above 1, government warnsManchester police vow to get tough on lockdown breakers Young women ‘most likely to suffer depression and anxiety in lockdown’Preston facing new coronavirus lockdown as infections surgeLuton mayor resigns after breaking lockdown rules at garden partyThe lockdowns will not be lifted until next Friday at the earliest. Making the announcements, health secretary Matt Hancock said: “The past week has been difficult for many people in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and East Lancashire, and I thank everyone in these areas for their patience and willingness to follow the rules.”He said official data did not yet show a decrease in the transmission of the virus, meaning ministers had no choice but to keep the current restrictions in place “to allow more time for the impact of this ban on indoor gatherings to be felt”. The extension of the measures to Preston was “at the request of the local area”, he added. “We are constantly examining the data on the prevalence of the virus in these areas, and we will review the measures again next week.“As we continue to see rising rates of the virus across Europe, it is vital we take every precaution to protect our country. I urge everyone in these areas to follow the rules, get yourself a free test as soon as you get any symptoms, and isolate if NHS Test and Trace tells you to.”The Lancashire Resilience Forum said: “Since the rise of cases was first announced last week, residents, communities and businesses have been asked to take extra precautions to reduce the spread of the virus.“These extra precautions are now mandatory and residents are still actively encouraged to get tested at the regional testing site based at Preston’s College if they are experiencing any symptoms of coronavirus.”There were 61 new cases in Preston in the week\u0026nbspto 4 August, the equivalent of 42.6 cases per 100,000 people – up from 21.7 per 100,000 in the previous seven days.Earlier, the Office for National Statistics\u0026nbspsaid that while national\u0026nbspfigures had suggested the percentage of those\u0026nbsptesting positive for Covid-19 had risen since the end of June, there was\u0026nbspnow evidence to suggest that trend may have levelled off.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While none of those named in the report have disputed the veracity of the messages, some have said that claims made in the report are false. The leaked internal communications also show officials warning to keep certain activities, including the direction of some campaigning resources, secret from the leadership and its allies or any other officials they deemed to be too left wing.“Many of us experienced the daily hostility and obstruction towards Jeremy, his office and members of the shadow cabinet and the frequent leaking and hostile briefing to the media,” the statement says, adding that “some of us will provide examples of these in our inidual submissions”. In 2016 hostile MPs tried to replace Mr Corbyn as party leader in a so-called “coup”, but he was re-elected with a bigger majority in a second leadership contest.Keir Starmer commissioned lawyer Martin Forde QC to lead an inquiry into the leaked document after it came to light, to look into its contents and how it was leaked. Other than factional hostility, the dossier claimed a “toxic” culture had developed at the party’s head office that included racist, sexist and violent language. It also claimed that factional hostility made it harder to deal with antisemitism in the party.

The party said a previous statement about staffers had “contained defamatory and false allegations”.Labour won 40 per cent of the vote in 2017, unexpectedly costing Theresa May her majority in parliament and increasing the party’s vote share from 30 per cent in 2015. In 2019, riven by splits over a possible second referendum and allegations of antisemitism, the party fell to 32 per cent and lost swathes of seats, particularly in the Midlands and north of England. The 2019 result was the worst in terms of MPs elected since 1935, though Labour’s second highest vote share since 2005.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Lebanon’s president has admitted he knew about a massive stockpile of explosive material stored at Beirut’s port nearly three weeks before it blew up, causing one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in modern history.Michel Aoun has however denied he was responsible for the devastating blast, saying on Friday he had no authority over the port and had ordered that action be taken.His comments mark the most senior confirmation yet that Lebanon’s rulers and security officials were aware that 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate had been stored improperly at the port.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe chemicals exploded on Tuesday after apparently being set off by a fire – killing 150 people, wounding more than 5,000, and causing billions of pounds of damage across the city.“Do you know how many problems have been accumulating?” Mr Aoun replied when a reporter pressed whether he should have followed up on his order.Beirut grandmother plays piano amongst wreckage of home‘Miracle’ girl found in rubble of Beirut explosion after 24 hours Devastating Beirut ammonium nitrate explosion recreated in new videoHe added that the previous government had known about the dangerous stockpile since it was confiscated from an impounded Russian-leased ship in 2013.Mr Aoun has been in his role since 2016.“The material had been there for seven years, since 2013. It has been there, and they said it is dangerous and I am not responsible. I don’t know where it was placed. I don’t even know the level of danger,” Mr Aoun told a news conference. He said that when he was told of the stockpile on 20 July he immediately ordered military and security officials “to do what is needed”.“There are ranks that should know their duties, and they were all informed ... When you refer a document and say, ‘do what is needed’, isn’t that an order?”Anger against the government has mounted in Beirut, with citizens from across the country descending on the capital to help with the clean-up and rescue efforts in an apparent absence of state-led efforts.Speaking to The Independent, people who have missing loved ones or were made homeless by the blast blamed chronic corruption and mismanagement within the ruling elite for the devastation, adding that authorities had done nothing to help them.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA government-led investigation is underway, however rights groups and citizens have called for an independent international probe over concerns it will fail to hold those responsible to account.Mr Aoun dismissed the idea and claimed the local probe was sufficient.He also appeared to question the initial analysis that the explosion was caused by negligence, saying that Lebanon’s own investigation would also look at the possibility that it could have been caused by a bomb or other “external intervention”.The president added that he had asked France for satellite imagery from the time of the blast to see if they showed any planes or missiles.So far, 16 port employees have been detained and others questioned, with the central bank freezing their accounts.Official letters circulating online showed the head of the customs department had repeatedly over the years that the ammonium nitrate in the port was a danger and had asked judicial officials for a ruling on how to remove it.What sparked the explosion not yet known. Former port officials told  newspaper they believed that fireworks had been placed inside warehouse 12, where the ammonium nitrate was stored, despite the obvious dangers.Gemmayze, Beirut’s beating heart, left in ruins by explosionThe same former port worker said that welding work was being carried out in the vicinity of the warehouse that may have started the initial fire.  Meanwhile Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday denied that the Lebanese militant group was involved in any way or excised any control on the port, saying – seemingly in jest – that the group knew Haifa port in Israel better than Beirut Port.He did not rule out a missile attack or an act of sabotage being behind the explosion but said that storing explosive materials like ammonium nitrate at the port for so long means “it is partially an issue of negligence, corruption, nepotism” that should not be ignored.There are concerns that the explosion could lead to a surge in coronavirus cases as at least four hospitals, including one hosting a Covid-19 testing facility, have been destroyed.  The World Health Organisation said it was scrambling to deploy $1.7m worth of personal protective equipment to Beirut after 17 containers filled with supplies for coronavirus response were destroyed at the port.Dr Rick Brennan, emergencies director for the eastern Mediterranean, said the “massive extra burden of injured people” could cause the health system to be “overstretched” by the emergency and coronavirus responses.This came as the Ministry of Health registered a daily record of 279 new Covid-19 cases.World leaders have cautiously stepped up to assist embattled Lebanon, although many have expressed concerns about corruption.European Council president Charles Michel is due to head to blast-ravaged Beirut for weekend talks with Lebanon’s leaders as the EU weighs up its contribution to a donor conference in coming days.He will also take part in a French-organised donor conference, along with the EU’s crisis management commissioner. Brussels has said that the virtual meeting would take place on Sunday, but France has yet to confirm a date. Pope Francis, meanwhile, sent a €250,000 donation to the Church of Lebanon to help in the aftermath of the explosion.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That title, instead, belongs to the neighbourhood of Gemmayze. In Gemmayze, there is life. Or at least there was. On Tuesday, more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate being held in a warehouse in Beirut’s port exploded and sent shock waves through the city. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt least 145 people died and 300,000 were made homeless. Gemmayze, a mile-long corridor that stretches east from downtown, lay right in the path of the destruction – less than 800 metres from the site of the blast. To look at what was destroyed in Gemmayze is to go some way to understanding what Beirut has lost: Not only lives, family members, friends, but part of the soul of the city. Homes, bars, restaurants, art galleries, livelihoods and historic buildings, all gone in an instant. “Gemmayze is freedom. Whatever you wanna wear, whatever you wanna say, whoever you wanna kiss, whatever you wanna do. It’s a beautiful place. That’s why I chose it,” says 33-year-old Hala Okeili, who lives and works in the neighbourhood. Okeili was driving towards her home when the explosion struck. Her whole life was there: her husband, her home, her business, her husband’s business. Her partner survived, the rest did not. “I arrived and everything was destroyed,” she says. “People bleeding. Our neighbours, faces I recognised. Young people bleeding from every single part of their bodies.”Okeili’s story, like the neighbourhood in which she lived, is one of hope and renewal, and now loss. She is like so many young Lebanese who had the education and means to do anything, go anywhere, but chose instead to pour their hearts into Beirut, their home. After this explosion, we don’t have any dreams. We don’t have any feelings. We can’t do anything. We are like visitors in our countryAfter training as a lawyer in France and working as a corporate lawyer for eight years, Okeili quit the profession to open a yoga studio in the centre of the neighbourhood in 2016. Sarvam Yoga was busy and thriving. So too was the coffee shop started by her husband, Omar, just down the road. Omar wanted to cater to a new generation of coffee connoisseurs and brought beans to Lebanon from around the world. “We had the choice to leave but we chose to stay and make a change,” says Okeili. “I’m a lawyer, I quit my job. I said to myself I want to open a yoga studio because people here need it. They need that piece of mind.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Building a business from the ground up anywhere in the world requires a special kind of bravery. In Lebanon, with all its dysfunction and corruption, it is the pursuit of pioneers. Gemmayze was full of pioneers. Restaurants were opening all the time – young Lebanese who had travelled and brought back cuisine from around the world. Art galleries, new bars with speciality cocktails. It was a testing ground for entrepreneurs and dreamers – as daring and erse as any New York street. In the evenings, Gouraud Street, which runs through the centre of the neighbourhood, was an intoxicating buzz of people spilling out of bars and onto the street. Often it wasn’t clear where the pavement ended and the road began. Steep steps, painted in bright colours, lead off from the main road up the hill. In the summer, they play host to concerts and outdoor film festivals. Mixed in among the gleaming, hopeful shop fronts were the remnants of the city’s gloried past. Stunning Ottoman-era mansions with balconies that hung over the street. Ornate townhouses with large windows from the French mandate, when the city earned the nickname “the Paris of the Middle East”. Some of these homes had been in the same families for generations. Elderly, working-class grandparents lived alongside young professionals. Okeili lived in one of those houses. A 300-year-old building just off the main street, which was destroyed. In the past two days, strangers have been helping her pull her belongings out from the shaky structure. Many of them are too damaged to be repaired. “We’re ashamed to talk about the materialistic losses, because a lot of people died. We know some who died,” she says. “But it’s a beautiful place. All the heritage, all the beautiful buildings are gone. We know they will just destroy them because no one is there to fix it. Gemmayze as we know it will no longer be the same.”Heba Kanso, who has lived in Gemmayze for three years, was out of the country when she received a call from her cousin on the day of the explosion. “He kept repeating ‘everything is gone, everything is gone.’ I was in shock,” the 33-year-old says. After checking in with her family to make sure they were safe, she started to run through a list of all the places in the neighbourhood she visited every day that would no longer be there anymore, and the people who might be hurt.  “I can go down my list but there is simply too much destruction and too many people hurt by this,” she says. “I realised that this area will be forever changed, including my home which was destroyed. Every single building is damaged and so much incredible historic architecture is destroyed.”Gemmayze felt like any street in a cosmopolitan city, but it had a distinct neighbourhood feel. Everyone knows each other. It had characters. In the centre of it all stood Le Chef, a decades-old restaurant serving Lebanese fare. The no-frills restaurant would fill up every night with locals and foreign visitors alike. Anyone who passed by the store would be beckoned by the booming voice of head chef Charbel Bassil: “Welcome, welcome,” he shouted, as he attempted to draw them into the brightly lit cafe. Bassil was in his restaurant when the explosion shattered the windows to Le Chef. He was injured, along with two of his staff and a customer. “We saw hell on earth,” he says, “but we thank God that we’re alive.”Now recovering at home, Bassil is not sure if, or how, he will reopen. Okeili feels the same. Like many others, she doesn’t trust Lebanon’s leaders enough to put her efforts into rebuilding all over again. Even before the explosion, Lebanon was teetering on the edge – its economy ruined by years of corruption by the country’s political class.  “They’ve taken everything away from us. Our money, our dreams, even our buildings – our souls. And we keep on fighting,” she says.  But this explosion may be the final straw. “The people of this country deserve a better life. They are creative, talented, resilient, they are happy people, full of life and love,” she says.“In one year we lost all our savings, our house, our business. I almost lost my husband. What more can I lose? If there’s no miracle my plan might be to leave. I don’t have the energy anymore. I might lose this again and again.”Bassil and Okeili, Beirut’s past and future, symbols of its hope and resilience, are now devoid of both.

Researchers studied more than , patients with new diagnoses of breast, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal cancer from the beginning of January through mid-April. In January and February, an average of , new cancers were diagnosed weekly, the researchers led by Dr. Harvey Kaufman of Quest Diagnostics reported. After March , weekly diagnoses fell between  per cent and  per cent. #Some cancers grow very slowly but others grow a little bit faster and these delays can be signicant for some patients,# Kaufman said. Researchers may have found a missing link in the coronavirus reproduction cycle that could potentially be targeted by drugs, according to a report in Science on Thursday. Scientists already knew that once the virus breaks into a cell, it forms double-membrane sacs, or vesicles, in which it makes copies of its genetic material. But the sacs appeared to be closed and it was previously unclear how the genetic material moved from the sac into the fluid in the cell, where new virus particles assembled themselves. Eric Snijder of Leiden University Medical Centre and his colleagues discovered tiny channels through both membranes that are wide enough to let the genetic material pass through. #In electron microscope images we can see stuff sticking out of these channels. #Most likely this stuff is the viral RNA on its way out, but as the sample is frozen, there is no movement and we still need to find ways to properly identy the stuff as viral RNA,# Snijder told Reuters. #Blocking this channel somehow#could create a big problem for the virus to do its tricks,# he added.The number of people in France infected with coronavirus rose by , on Friday, a new post-lockdown high.The figures follow increases of , on Thursday and , on Wednesday, the health ministry said in a statement.It also said that the cumulative death toll from the virus now stood at ,, an increase of  compared to  on Thursday and  on Wednesday.Calornia has surpassed , deaths from the coronavirus, making it the US state with the third-highest deaths since the start of the pandemic.The figure was reported today by Johns Hopkins University, with , dead since the outbreak began in Calornia in February.New York has the highest number of deaths at more than ,, followed by New Jersey with nearly ,.

But in the end, they wont be able to carry out their threats.”Last night the Government hit back, accusing the unions of working against the interests of parents, with a survey showing nine in ten think it’s safe to send their children back to school.A senior government source blasted: “Union leaders should be working in the interests of children by helping them get back to school safely, not damaging their prospects by trying to wreck theto school in September.”Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has branded Dr Bousted’s organisation the ‘No Education Union’ over her repeated opposition to schools reopening.Dr Bousted’s comments sparked fury among MPs last night - and sets up another major battle between Westminster and the unions over next month’s school reopening.Hitting back at her defeatist attitude, former Children’s Minister Tim Loughton told The Sun: “The only thing that seems impossible is for the NEU to spend a fraction of the time supporting schools, to make sure they are able to welcome back their pupils in September, rather than constantly scaremongering about how dficult it all is.“A bit more how can we make this happen rather than the constant computer says no wouldnt go amiss, which is what most schools have quietly and calmly been getting on with in spite of the NEU doommongerers.”The Tory MP added: “Many children will have been completely out of school for almost  months come September and the catch up and re-acclimatisation for them will be considerable.“How many more months of damage to our children in some of their most formative years will it take before the NEU finally give their blessing to letting their members get on with the job they are itching to do. This is the worst example of playing political games during the pandemic and it is our children who are missing out.”  Boss of the Commons Education committee Robert Halfon said: “The unions should be doing everything possible to get our children learning again.Millions of kids have suffered in the lockdown with a lack of learning, safeguarding problems and mental health problems – it’s time to get the kids back in school.”“Rather than her saying it’s impossible, they should be taking the attitude of Nicholas Winton who famously said ‘ it’s not impossible, there must be a way to do it.’”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a list of questions that authorities in Beirut wanted Grechushkin to answer.The police chief said the questions were about clarications and explanations concerning the vessel and its cargo.The killer cargo of , tons of ammonium nitrate was confiscated in  from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to MozambiqueLebanese authorities reportedly deemed the ship not seaworthy and impounded the -year-old vessel and its crew of ten sailors.The crew protested that Grechushkin claimed he had gone bankrupt and had abandoned the ship - going on hunger strike before finally being allowed to go ashore.Grechushkin was said to have paid a “huge penalty” for transporting the cargo which led to him going bust - later moving to Cyprus with his we Irina.He lives there with his we and youngest son Miron in Limassol, a city with an estimated , expats from Russia.Neither the businessman nor his family have yet commented on the explosion, which had one fth the power of a nuclear bomb.The Russian captain of the ship Boris Prokoshev, now , warned at the time of the deadly nature of the cargo.He said: “The vessel’s owner abandoned it and we were abandoned too. We were living on a powder keg for ten months without being paid.The ammonium nitrate was sold by Georgian fertiliser maker Rustavi Azot LLC, and was to be delivered to a Mozambique explosives maker, Fabrica de Explosivos.It was however impounded by Lebanese authorities, and sat on the dockside in Warehouse  for six years until it blew up on Tuesday.Anger is mounting as Lebanons government and customs officials point fingers at each other as to who is the blame for the monstrous explosion.Hang up the nooses trended across Lebanese social media in an indication of the fury that followed the initial shock and grief.Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse  - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse .President Michel Aoun said the government was determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable.Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material since  to be put under house arrest.Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told Al Jazeera he had only found out about the presence of the explosive material stashed at the port  days before the explosion.No minister knows whats in the hangars or containers, and its not my job to know, he said.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.He said: We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in  and  to ask the concerned maritime agency to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One of the documents cited similar requests in  and  - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NH₄NO₃.The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released.Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast.In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability.It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in  that killed  people.Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the  Mumbai train bombings.By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly.The chemical is classied as an “energetic material” meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes.If there is a signicant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion. Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will pay the price as rescue operations continue in Beirut.International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for those potentially still trapped beneath the rubble.The US, UK, France, Gulf states and even rivals Israel have offered money and assistance, as President Aoun declared three days of mourning and announced he would release £m of emergency funds.HMS Enterprise will carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.British engineering experts have found the blast was unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.They believe the explosion was the equivalent of , to , tonnes of TNT.There are concerns of food shortages and unrest in the city, with the blast compounding anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They said: “Measures must be taken on a borough-by-borough basis and on a town-by-town basis in boroughs where there are only one or two coronavirus hotspots but the rates in other parts of the borough are low.”The threat of more local lockdown comes as the Government prepares to reopen schools for all pupils in September - and a major study warned this week that this could cause a second wave of Covid-the Test  Trace system isnt up to scratch.Many of the local areas seeing spikes have implemented their own contact tracing systems, relying on local knowledge of the area, after the national service failed to pick up enough contacts.

Pressure was growing on the Prime Minister’s chief aide to provide evidence of the claims which he made in the garden of No  after the Mirror revealed his first -mile lockdown trip to his parents. Mr Cummings has categorically denied that he was in Houghall Woods near their Durham home on the morning of Sunday April . But walkers Dave and Clare Edwards told police in a statement that they were ‘ certain’ that they had seen him. They have gone to the Independent Office for Police Conductabout how their report of the sighting was handled. Former chief constable Mike Barton, in charge when Durham was recognised as the best force in the country, told the Mirror: “It is the classic formula. Eventually the police get blamed. “If Mr Cummings has proof that he did not go to Durham on that day - then let’s just see it.” His former colleagues at Durham must now decide whether to approach Mr Cummings for a statement on the latest claims, or ask him to produce his evidence of his whereabouts that day. It is understood that the force took the advice of a top QC before releasing their statement after Mr Cummings’ now infamous trip to Barnard Castle to ‘test his eyesight’. Durham Police decided that he may have committed a “minor breach” of the rules on April  - his we’s birthday - but that no further action would be taken.  A spokeswoman for the IOPC said: “In accordance with the police complaints procedure, we have forwarded a complaint to Durham Constabulary. “It will now be a matter for the force to determine the next steps including whether this complaint merits referral to the IOPC.”Their statement came amid growing pressure on Boris Johnson to make public the evidence provided by his chief advisor about April .Dave and Clare, both , are not alone in thinking that Mr Cummings was in Houghall Woods on that day.  The joint Mirror andinvestigation has now tracked down four people who have reported sightings of him that morning. The first man got in touch with the Mirror after spotting him with a female companion in the area at around .am. Dave, who works in manufacturing, and Clare, a nurse and care home worker for  years, believe that they spotted him there with a group of people just after am. The fourth witness told us how he left his home at precisely .am on April  and was in the woods by around . to .am. He had not come forward before he spoke to the Mirror. He said: “I heard on the grapevine that he had been seen in the area of the woods before April . “It had been spoken about by people who had spotted him in the area. I left my house at .am on April .  “It was quite a warm day so it would have taken around  minutes to get there, I think that I saw him around .-.am. “It was on the section going down towards the Botanical Gardens, towards Houghall Farm in the area at the back of Houghall Agricultural college.“At first I could not quite believe that I had seen him. I thought ‘why would he be up here ’ But I was sure about it at the time.”Clare, , is “% certain” in her claims that she saw Mr Cummings. She added: “It would be great to seehe could produce anything.“I just want the truth to be out there.” A further witness told thethey saw Cummings back in north London, on Hampstead Heath, later the same afternoon. Mr Cummings has described accusations that he made a second lockdown trip to the North East as “”. That denial came after we revealed in May that he drove  miles with his we Mary Wakefield, who had Covid- symptoms, and son to self isolate at his parents’ home near Durham on March , at the height of the lockdown.  During their two-week stay, the family went to Barnard Castle,  miles away, which he later claimed was to test his eyesight before the next day’s drive to London. A No spokesman said that Durham Constabulary had made clear that ‘they are not taking further action against Mr Cummings’ and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. “The Prime Minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed,” they added. Durham Constabulary said: “As outlined in our statement of May , we carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation.” But questions were asked about the PM’s decision to back Mr Cummings after it had been revealed he broke the Government’s rules, prompting public outcry and damaging confidence in lockdown restrictions. In his Downing Street garden press conference, Mr Cummings told reporters: “There is a particular report that I ed there on April th. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be .

At least  desperate people made the crossing in small boats on Thursday, with a heavily pregnant woman and young families spotted aboard boats on Friday. Some children, including babies in arms, were seen leaving Border Force boats at Dover in the blazing sunshine. Home Secretary Priti Patel described the number of illegal crossings was “appalling”, and was said to be considering bringing in the Navy to stem the numbers making the perilous journey across the world’s busiest shipping lane. But a Ministry of Defence source said the idea was “completely potty” and could put lives at even greater risk. Campaigners said the rising numbers showed the Home Office had “lost control” on the issue and were fuelling “chaos and criminality”. Ms Patel said: “The number of illegal small boat crossings is appalling and unacceptably high. The figures are shameful. “France and other EU states are safe countries. Genuine refugees should claim asylum there, not risk their lives and break the law by coming to the UK.” The senior Tory said she wanted to make the route “unviable” by stopping people from leaving France and intercepting boats in the English Channel. Immigration Minister Chris Philp will travel to France to meet his counterparts next week. Bella Sankey, the director of charity Detention Action, said the rising numbers showed the Home Office had “lost control and all credibility on this issue, fuelling chaos, criminality and untold trauma for those who feel forced to make these dangerous crossings.”  She accused Ms Patel of “naive grandstanding”, saying: “What is needed is recognition that people who reach France will have valid claims to protection in the UK and the urgent development of safe and legal routes for them to do so. “This would end the crossings overnight.” The Home Secretary’s spokesman confirmed that Navy support was being considered, as well as more Border Force resources in the Channel. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is taking stock of the situation before taking the matter further, his spokesman said. An MOD source said bringing in the Navy was “impractical and unnecessary” adding: “It is a completely inappropriate and disproportionate approach to take."},{"url":null,"title":"uk must confront long shadow","story":"NewsUK must confront long shadow of British Empire with probe into imperial recordEXCLUSIVE: New call for an investigation into human rights abuses and wrongdoing during the British empire in the wake of global Black Lives Matter protestsShareByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsBlack Lives Matter protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The idea could reignite the furore which erupted in the UK after the death of Mr Floyd - which saw the statue of slave trader Edward Colston toppled and cast into Bristol’s harbour. The Black Lives Matter protests, sparked by Mr Floyd’s death at the hands of a white police officer, prompted fresh recriminations about the UK’s colonial past, including monuments to people linked with the slave trade.  A statue of slaveholder Robert Milligan was removed from London’s Docklands in June, and Mayor Sadiq Khan announced a review of all statues and street names linked to the slave trade in London.Tensions flared at demonstrations in London, with a statue of Winston Churchill daubed with graffiti. Lib Dem equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine, who will move the motion at the party’s autumn conference, said: “Racial justice cannot wait. The UK has never properly addressed the long shadow of the British Empire nor done anywhere near enough to eradicate systemic racism in our society and our institutions. We must fill the gaps in our national narrative. “A commission would play a vital role in uncovering historic injustice and abuse, to truly lay bare the legacy of the Empire. Citizens’ Assemblies will empower communities to take charge of how that history is memorialised and contextualised to build a more inclusive country.

Our front page today reports the account of witnesses who believe they saw the PMaposs top aide near Durham on the morning April .That is almost a week after he ed to London. Yet Mr Cummings categorically denies he made a second trip up north, and says he has evidence to prove it. Todayaposs story has come to light after two of the alleged witnesses, Clare Edwards, , and her husband Dave, complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Clare believes her allegation that she saw Mr Cummings on April  was not taken seriously enough by officers. Given itaposs months now since the original story, it can be hard to grasp what this all means, and why it matters. So here is an explainer.What did Dominic Cummings do  The Tory adviser drove  miles with his we, who had Covid- symptoms, and son to self-isolate at his family farm near Durham on March  at the height of the lockdown. The next morning Mr Cummings himself fell ill, and the family proceeded to stay for two weeks, including a night when his son ended up in hospital, although he tested negative. During their stay, the family went to Barnard Castle,  miles away, on April , which Mr Cummings later claimed was to test his eyesight before the drive to London the next day. Mr Cummings admitted the trip but claimed he had not broken the rules. That is despite the rules at the time clearly banning non-essential travel, or leaving your home at allyou or a member of your household had symptoms. He claimed he was exempt from these rules because he needed to seek childcare for his son, in case he fell too ill to care for him. But he admitted he did not, in the end, need childcare. He ed to London on April .  What did police do  Durham Police investigated, and concluded on May  that there might have been a minor breach of the Regulations that would have warranted police intervention. However, the force added: Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings toto the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken. They also took witness statements and a photograph from the Edwardses on May , after being contacted by the couple. In their statement on May  they concluded there was insufficient evidence to investigate further.  What are new witnesses saying  A man got in touch with the Mirror on April , claiming he saw Mr Cummings with a female companion in Houghall Woods at . that morning. But in a press conference in the No garden in May, Mr Cummings denied this claim – saying: Photos and data on my phone prove this to be . Since then, three other people who claim to have seen Mr Cummings on April  have come forward.Clare Edwards, , said she is “% certain” she saw Boris Johnson ’s chief adviser while walking in Houghall Woods near Durham on the morning of Sunday, April . Her husband Dave claims to have seen Mr Cummings too. Clare and Dave have now comp­lained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, claiming Durham police did not properly investigate their allegations about Mr Cummings. Another new witness claims to have seen Mr Cummings and a female companion walking between the beauty spot and the family home that morning between . and .. Another person then said they think they saw Mr Cummings on Hampstead Heath in North London that afternoon, four hours later at .pm. A test-drive of the route on a quiet Sunday after lockdown took three hours and  minutes.  How is this dferent to what we knew already  It is all about the date. The people who have spoken to the Mirror believe they saw Mr Cummings near Durham on April . That is almost a week after Mr Cummings ed to London from his two-week stay with his family. If Mr Cummings was in Durham on the morning of April , which he has previously denied, it would mean he made a second trip during lockdown. And that he misled both the PM - who spent six hours discussing the matter with him - and the public.  Why does it matter  Firstly, Dominic Cummings categorically denied that he had made a second trip to Durham during lockdown. So the claims suggest that either the witnesses were mistaken, or that Mr Cummings did make a second trip but said otherwise. Secondly, Mr Cummings said he had evidence to prove he did not make a second trip to Durham. Boris Johnson also suggested he had seen this evidence, saying:it pleases you I will say yes, I did. So the new claims add pressure on Mr Cummings or Downing Street to say what this evidence was. Thirdly, Mr Cummings gave a detailed -controversial - reasoning for travelling up north at the end of March. If he had travelled up north a second time, which he denies, this reasoning would be discredited. And fourthly, the law still banned leaving oneaposs home without reasonable excuse on April . A second trip would raise questions about whether this was followed.  What happens now  Labour have now demanded Dominic Cummings produce the evidence to prove he did not make a second trip to the north east during lockdown.Deputy leader Angela Rayner said: The public have a right to know whether the Prime Minister’s chief advisor made a second lockdown-breaching trip to Durham, and it is surely therefore only right that this evidence is produced. If Dominic Cummings was in London during both the morning and afternoon of the th April, and not in Durham as has been alleged, I’m sure that he the Prime Minister will welcome this opportunity to set the record straight.Former North West prosecutor Nazir Afzal, whose brother died of coronavirus, has launched his own appeal for evidence after accusing the police forces who investigated the case of ”closing ranks”.He said today: “Mr Cummings stated that he was not in Durham at any time on the th, he and these witnesses cannot both be right. “The failure of the police to investigate remains very disappointing given the public interest and concern.” The Met Police is also coming under pressure to investigate the allegations from, among others, the chair of Londonaposs Police and Crime Committee. But a No spokesman said yesterday: “Durham Constabulary have made clear they are not taking any further action against Mr Cummings and that by locating himself at his father’s premises he did not breach the regulations. “The Prime Minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and he considers the matter closed.” Durham Constabulary said: “As outlined in our statement of May , [we] carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation.” Timeline of events Monday  March: Prime Minister Boris Johnson advises everyone in the UK to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.Monday  March: In an evening TV address, the PM announces a UK-wide lockdown - effective immediately - to contain the spread of the virus. The public are instructed that they must stay at home from that evening, except for four very limited purposes - shopping for necessities, one form of exercise per day, any medical need, and travelling to and from workneeded. Public gatherings of more than two people, unless from the same household or under an exception, are banned effective immediately. Thursday  March: The lockdown restrictions that the PM launched on  March formally take force in law at pm, with £ fines for first-time offenders who break the rules. The three-day lag is due to the need to pass legislation through Parliament.Friday  March: Dominic Cummings is spotted running out of No to rush home to his we, who is ill with coronavirus symptoms. The family travel up to his parents’ home near Durham that weekend. Cummings later falls ill with the virus, but they do not need childcare for their four-year-old son as his we recovers. Tuesday  March: Durham Police have said they were “made aware” that the PM’s top aide was in the area and spoke to his father, although it is unclear whether they approached him or the other way round.Sunday  April: Cummings is seen standing outside the family property with a little boy and Abba blasting out on the radio.

David lost his job just  hours earlier, and Shelley, , was diagnosed with multiple sclerosislast year, forcing her to give up her job as a community carer. The couple, from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, was hit by a double tragedy this year when Davidaposs sister-in-law died after suffering a massive heart attack, and her husband - Davidaposs brother - lost his battle with Covid-. The Adams have tried to stay positive despite the setbacks in le. Now, they are making plans for their windfall, starting with a new car - a Nissan Qashqai - to replace their ageing Ford Mondeo. It will eventually be followed by Davidaposs first holiday outside of the UK. David said: “Many people would think the redundancy was the worst news but in fact it’s just the final straw in a catalogue of dficulties we have experienced. Just last year Shelley was diagnosed with MS and had to give up the job she loved as a community carer, putting a strain on our finances and heightening her clinical anxiety.In April we sadly lost my sister-in-law due to a massive heart attack, then two weeks in early May we received the news that sadly so many families have received this year, her husband, my brother, had passed due to Covid-. “It’s been a really tough time but we stick together and try to keep smiling, whatever le has thrown at us. Never in our wildest dreams did we think the next thing thrown our way would be £ million quid. David discovered the coupleaposs big win when he checked their numbers in the early hours of Sunday morning - and he rushed into his bedroom to give his bleary-eyed we the thrilling news, although she admitted she wasnapost so happy at first. Shelley said: “David plays online from time to time, always using two lines of numbers which are important to us. On Sunday morning, about .am, David came into our bedroom saying ‘are you awake’, to which I pretty grumpily replied ‘well I am now’. But as he switched on the light I could see he was shaking so my grumpiness turned to worry as I asked him what was up, whereupon he told me we’d won the lottery. I was furious, I thought he meant a tenner.” As David showed her the winning numbers on his mobile phone, she realised they had struck it big. She burst into her sonaposs bedroom to ask him to double check the numbers.  Shelley said: “The poor man, he was meant to be up at am to get to work and there am I, waving a phone in his face and telling him we’ve won £ million. Needless to say none of us slept well the rest of the night and we were relieved to confirm the win with Camelot in the morning.” David and Shelley have been cautious in their celebrations and it has taken some time to come to terms with the magnitude of their win. David added: “We’ve always worked hard and know the value of money but this is a number far beyond anything we could ever comprehend.

The pilots realised something was wrong as they were thundering down the runway and saw red and white flashing lights indicating they had m left. The Airbus A- passed over the end of the runway at a height of ft. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch report said there were “several obstructions beyond the runway that could have caused signicant damage to the aircraft and its occupants”. The two pilots had used tablet computers to work out the acceleration needed to get airborne. They meant to input that they were starting their take-off from ,m up the two-and-a-half mile runway at the point of an intersecting taxiway called S. But they wrongly inputted that they were starting from taxiway S at the start of the runway. The autopilot assumed they had an extra ,m to take off, and reduced their initial speed to compensate.

Each of the beds are still neatly made up, asthey are waiting to be slept in once more. While the windows are boarded there are signs of a long-forgotten le all over the eerie abandoned home. In a nursery, a crowd of stuffed animals have been lovingly placed in a crib, no longer played with and waiting to be picked up once more. Even the lights have been left on asthe former owners plan toand pick up their old le where they left off. Family snaps line the mantel piece as dried flowers take up pride of place in the fire place that hasnapost known heat for more than  years. Shelves and dressers are filled with knick knacks and the huge comfy sofas havenapost been sat on for more than a decade and now simply gather dust. Paintings hang on the walls of the bedrooms while several of the ornate beds are decorated with bright throws, useful only now for the insects and mice who have made the huge house their home. Meanwhile, in the utility room, an indoor watering can waits by the sink to water long dead plants. Cooking utensils still hang on the kitchen wall, which comes complete with a huge cooker unused for family meals for years. Clothes are still folded neatly in drawers with no attempt made to pack them, while a stunning wooden piano and a drum kit have remained unplayed since . A bike stands ready to be ridden in the hallway, while a bathroom is draped over the side of the bath, ready for whoever should need it next. Even the electric toothbrush, propped up next to a sink, still has battery le in it. In the sun-dappled conservatory a single candle has drouped under the weight of the constant sunlight. One of the most heartbreaking finds, discovered by urban explorer, Freaky D, is handwritten note, penned by children, left in drawers and on shelves in the house. He said: The house is filled with letters between family members and friends, photographs from celebrations, crafts made by the children and countless other items that make it a very typical family home. Notes left out from small children in scrawled handwriting with heartfelt love letters to their parents really give this abandoned home character - and a lot of emotion. Itaposs unclear why the mansion was abandoned so suddenly and after lying empty for so long it has been targeted by vandals. Ivy now grows over the windows that havenapost been boarded up, giving the whole house an eerie glow. Freaky D said: The whole house appears like the family had just vanished without a trace, a family home full of le had, in the blink of an eye, been frozen in time. I really hope this property remains hidden from people who wish to disrupt this amazing building. According to Freaky D, the house was used as a rectory for many years and the present building has been in place since approximately . The Rectory served a small village which had very prominent links with the mining industry.

The Nissan Pavilion is a ,-square-metre, zero-emission centre fitted with solar  and supplied with renewable hydroelectric power. And in a global first, electric vehicle drivers will be able to discharge power from their caraposs battery pack to pay for parking when they visit. The process at the complex in Yokohama, Japan, has been designed to showcase the Nissan LEAF electric caraposs aposvehicle to gridaposcharging capability, and gives a glimpse at how British companies will be able to save money from their fleets of electric cars. The LEAF, which is built at Nissanaposs Sunderland plant as well as in Japan, has bi-directional charging that allows power to be pulled from its battery as well as be supplied to it. On this occasion, the Nissan Pavilion is absorbing electricity from the Nissan as a aposparking feeapos, but the LEAF family hatchback can also be used to supply energy to bricks and mortar closer to home. It is estimated the kWh battery from a Nissan LEAF can power the average UK home for a week. Makoto Uchida, Nissan CEO, said: The Pavilion is a place where customers can see, feel, and be inspired by our near-future vision for society and mobility. As the world shts to electric mobility, EVs will be integrated into society in ways that go beyond just transportation. The exhibition centre also has a cafe which operates on power supplied by the LEAF electric cars and solar energy. In the UK, Nissan has partnered with energy provider E.ON to explore the use of vehicle-to-grid charging.The two companies have this week successfully installed  VGchargers at the car manufactureraposs European Technical Centre in Cranfield, Bedfordshire. It demonstrates how storing and sharing electricity in fleet vehiclesapos batteries can generate additional revenue for participating companies as well as supporting the power grid. The project, co-funded by Innovate UK, allows energy stored in car batteries to be sold back to the grid when demand for power is high.

Michael Beirne, from Keresley, West Midlands, shot a video that reveals the squalid conditions at the park in East Sussex. Dad-of-two Beirneaposs video showed bird mess on a window, a dirty light switch and a tatty bin without a lid. The -year-old, his girlfriend, and their two young children should have been there three-day weekend break starting on Friday, July . But the family walked out of the chalet without staying the night after checking in, reports CoventryLive. They went to complain but found a queue to speak to the manager going out of the door so they handed back their keys to room  in block  and went to stay with his aunt, Christine, who was at a caravan park nearby in Camber Sands on the East Sussex coast. Christine, , an NHS worker also from Keresley, said: From the moment they walked in they could see how disgusting and dirty it was. The drawers and furniture were broken, which would have been dangerous with a two-and-a-half-year-old and a four-month-old walking around.  One of the drawing cabinets was not even screwed into the wall because the bracket was loose. They went to speak to the manager but the queue was going out of the door, so they handed the keys back and left to stay with me at a caravan park down the road.” In his video, Michael goes from room to room pointing our grim marks on furniture, floors and walls.In a bedroom draw he finds a pair of discarded boxer shorts. Furniture in the video is shown to be damaged, curtains dirty and even parts of a floor missing.  The paint on window sills is shown to be cracked with Michael commenting: All that would need, it would take a five minute lick of gloss, youaposd probably get an extra tenner out of the room doing that.

Wesley Streete, , was a childhood friend of Keeley and he raped and strangled her before dumping her half-naked body in a stream in Tamworth, Staffordshire, on September  last year. Keeley, a barmaid who was just ft ins and weighed six-and-a-half stone, had trusted him to walk her home after a night out in Birmingham. They had watched rapper Aitch at the O Academy and Keeley told a female friend Iaposve got Wes, heaposll walk me back. Itaposll be fine.Ahead of Streeteaposs sentencing, Debbie Watkins, Keeleyaposs devastated mum told The Sun Online : I hope he never comes out, he should never be freed.He’s never said sorry for robbing me of my beautul daughter. He’s evil and I can never forgive him. I can’t stop crying. After Streete murdered Keeley he covered her body with branches and repeatedly lied about what had happened to the -year-old. He changed his account at least four times before trial.  Streete, who worked for Ocado, initially claimed to have left Keeley to walk home alone, before later alleging at trial he accidentally killed her during consensual sex in Wigginton Park. Keeleyaposs uncle, Jason Brown, who discovered his nieceaposs partially-submerged body during a massive search effort involving family, friends and police. Debbie said she found the four-week trial very traumatic. Streete was handed down a le sentence with a minimum term of  years to be served.  The  days he has already spent in custody has been taken into account meaning he will not be considered for release for  years and  days from now. The -year-old was given a mandatory le sentence by Mr Justice Jeremy Baker at Stafford Crown Court for the killing and what the judge called a carefully crafted scheme of lies following his crime, tailored to fit the evidence. Justice Baker said: She told Monique she would be safe at home, as you had offered to walk with her back to her house. Unfortunately nothing could have been further from truth.  Because on the way back to her house I am satisfied you persuaded Keeley to ert to the rugby club, probably on the pretext of going for a smoke. However what took place in Wigginton Park is you proceeded to rape Keeley Bunker in the course of which you murdered her by throttling her, in all probability by placing her in a choke-hold for sufficient period of time to kill her. He added the choke-hold would have been minutes, rather than seconds.  When you had finished with her you decided to hide Keeleyaposs now leless body by depositing it in the brook, covering it up with branches, he continued. You then walked back to your home, went to bed and slept. He added: I am aware that no sentence which is imposed in relation to the offence of murder will assuage the feelings of devastation, grief and loss suffered by Keeley Bunkeraposs family and those who loved her. It is clear that not only was she loved by so many but that Keeley was one of the most kindest, caring of iniduals.  Not only has [Keeley] lost the opportunity of fulfilling her le ambition, helping to educate young children, her family have lost the company of their beloved daughter, sister and niece,he said. Jurors at Stafford Crown Court took just over eight hours to convict the -year-old earlier this month. Keeleyaposs devastated family paid a heartbreaking tribute to her after Streeteaposs guilty verdict. Debbie wiped away tears outside Stafford Crown Court, where relatives and friends wore pink ribbons and flowers in Miss Bunkeraposs memory.  Speaking outside court, a family spokesman said: Keeley Bunker, our Keeley Bunks, was the kindest, most beautul young lady that you could ever wish to meet. Keeley was compassionate, loving, caring and would put others before herself, always. We could never have wished for anymore from Keeley, she was perfect in every way. Her le was taken away so cruelly and far too soon. Keeley had many dreams that have all been stolen from both her and us. We will not see Keeley marry, go on to have children, enjoy any holidays or her work.

To fill the time, many people have taken up new hobbies and some families have said their new shared interests have brought them closer together - and they plan to continue them going forward. As the governmentaposs restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey with Very has looked back at how we all spent the strictest months of lockdown and how people view the “new normal”.Both kids and their parents have the opportunity to do new things, with  per cent of mums and dads with teenage kids saying theyaposve tried something for the first time or more often than normal. Cooking and baking is the most popular aposnewapos activity, with  per cent of parents with teenagers and  per cent of people with younger kids surveyed listing it. Gardening and exercise were next up on the list in both groups. Meanwhile, their kids have also enjoyed cooking and baking, at  per cent, while  per cent have tried their hand at gardening. Arts and crafts and growing their own fruit and veg also made the top five.Interestingly, the exclusive Daily Mirror and Very survey showed that gardening was far lower down the list for kids younger than , with exercise in second place after cooking and baking.Boys were more likely to have spent more time playing a musical instrument and doing DIY. And for many, the group activities have brought them together as a family. Describing the positives of lockdown, one parent wrote: Being able to help more with the kids home schooling as normally I am in work. Building a veg garden and growing our own veg has been a fun thing for all of us.  And I feel we have all grown closer as a family. Meanwhile, other families used the opportunity to exercise and to improve their fitness. Some even opted to do this all together, either through group work outs or by making it a competition. One parent said: Getting myself fitter by running more on my treadmill. The rest of family doing it as well, so we are fitter as a family physically and mentally. Some made the most of their one trip out of the house for exercise by going out for a walk with loved ones. One wrote: Going for a walk with my daughter and spotting all the wildle and breathing cleaner air. Another added: Going out for walks and discovering areas around where I live that I never knew were there. While everyone has obviously faced their own challenges in lockdown, some people have found itaposs also brought some advantages, Veryaposs research found. Parents of younger kids are more likely to have found the lockdown fun compared to those with teenage children, but an incredible amount say the restrictions have brought them closer as a family.

Max Staines, now four, was born with his stomach, liver and bowels on the outside of his body - a rare condition called gastroschisis. Mum Lauren, , was given the diagnosis of her unborn baby at her  week scan, with medics warning her the chances of Max surviving were very low. They even offered Lauren the chance to abort her unborn child. But the former cabin crew member refused, and Max defied doctors predictions at every turn, finally getting discharged from St George’s Hospital in central London in June. Max underwent four years of regular appointments since le-saving surgery at birth. Lauren, from Hook, Hants, said today: “Every single day I look at him and think you are my miracle. “Everybody calls him my ‘miracle baby’ but at the same time we worked bloody hard to get him through this and he fought so hard as well. “I look back at pictures and realise how far we have come from being absolutely terried of being a single mum and worrying that I was going to leave hospital without a baby at all to being as happy as we are now. “When we were told that he was going to be discharged, it was the perfect piece of the puzzle towards our happy ending.” At  weeks pregnant in January , doctors confirmed both Max’s liver and bowels were outside of his body, but were unable to determine how damaged they would be from fluid in the amniotic sack until he was born.  Despite the devastating odds, Lauren enjoyed a successful pregnancy with no cramps, sickness or tiredness, but was growing increasingly concerned that with every week that passed, Max’s organs were becoming more damaged. Expert surgeons at St George’s had put together a full birth plan, but in April that year, the expectant mum was thrown into action when she realised her usually active baby hadn’t moved or kicked all day and decided to go to the local hospital to check nothing untoward was happening. Max’s heart rate had dropped and doctors decided to perform an emergency c-section, transferring the newborn straight to St George’s for a six-hour operation to package his exposed stomach, liver and bowels, back inside his body. Mum of one, Lauren, added: “When he was born the nurse asked meI wanted to look at him and I hesitated. “She said ‘right too late’ he’s going to have to go and he was transferred to St George’s before I’d even seen him. “I couldn’t go with him because they wanted me to be able to stand up on my own before I was transferred as well.  “I didn’t get to meet him for nine hours after he was born, and when I got to St George’s his surgeon said ‘it’s a lot worse than we had anticipated’. “But when he came back out after the operation, he had a huge smile on his face and looked at me and said ‘we managed to do a full closure’.” After the emergency surgery, Max had to be fitted with a long line to give his body the nutrients he wouldn’t be able to get until his stomach could digest food, and doctors had to drain the remaining fluid from around his organs with an NG tube. But despite predictions he would need to stay in hospital for six months, the defiant tot made rapid progression, and within three weeks was on his mum’s milk and was able to be sent home. Since then Max has been under the close watch of medics at St George’s with regular appointments and talks of fitting him with a colostomy bag to manage the fact he was unable to tell when he needed the toilet due to his shortened bowel.  But in another miraculous turn, the youngster suddenly realised his own toilet cues in January this year and was able to go into ‘big boy pants’ overnight. Recalling her pregnancy, Lauren said: “We’d been in a relationship for a couple of years but Max’s dad didnapost want to have a baby so I decided to go ahead with the pregnancy on my own. “When I went for my first ultrasound scan at  weeks, the lady was looking at the screen for ages and then said she wanted to get someone to check something. “I could see from on the look on her face that something was wrong. “When she came back, they told me that they believed his organs were on the outside of his body, that it was very rare and they didn’t really know what they were looking at so they referred me to another hospital.

It occurs when a dog cannot reduce its own body temperature - and it can be deadly.So itaposs vital that you avoid going for walks during hotter periods, keep your pets hydrated and in the shade when sitting outside. But over the years, there has been a lot of speculation as to whether itaposs safe to give your dogs ice cubes in a heatwave. And with so much information available, itaposs hard to know what you can and canapost trust. So we asked the experts at the RSPCA to debunk the issue. Are we allowed to give our dogs ice cubes during a heatwave  The answer is yes, and itaposs recommended. Over the years, a number of pets owners have been cautious not to give their dogs ice cube, in fear that their belly will bloat - this is extremely dangerous in larger dogs especially. But giving ice and other frozen goodies to dogs is safe, and can help to keep their temperatures down.   A spokesman for the animal rescue charity said: “The RSPCA advises freezing a dogaposs water bowl or kong before putting water or fresh treats inside .  We also advise putting ice cubes into your petaposs water or making frozen treats to help cool them down.  You could try adding a meat stock like chicken or beef to your ice cubes too. But some vets fear that giving your dogs ice could lead to tooth damage.Dr. Susan C. Nelson, a clinical professor at the Veterinary Health Center at Kansas State University said to  PetMD  : The larger and harder the cube, the higher the chance of this occurring.Offering dogs smaller cubes or even ice shavings can help prevent this problem.

It is not yet certainthe tragedy which killed at least  people on Tuesday was an accident or terrorism. Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun said: “There is a possibility of a rocket or bomb or other act.’“ The blast, which flattened much of Beirut’s port, was caused when a fire set off a ,-ton pile of ammonium nitrate in a warehouse. But shipping company Portico wants permission to store up to , tons in ­Portsmouth, Hants. The firm insists the plan is safe. But there are fears over the risk posed by the chemical, used in ­fertiliser. Terror group Hezbollah has previously threatened to use it as a weapon and MI foiled a plot in London five years ago.Last year Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah claimed he was storing the substance in Haa, Israel, adding: “A few missiles hit the tanks [and] tens ofthousands will be killed.”Haras Rafiq, who has sat on ious government taskforces combating extremism and terrorism, said of Nasrallah’s grim boast: “In that video, he states it wouldn’t take much to turn that stored chemical into deadly bombs.  We certainly need to be more vigilant when looking at Hezbollah and how it operates globally.” Three tons of ammonium nitrate were found in four London properties in . A man in his s was arrested but later released. Meanwhile, Portico defended its ­Portsmouth plan, saying: “These goods are handled on a regular basis in ports and held in larger quantities in agricultural businesses.  Strict inspections are in place, our licence is for the smaller, lower risk amount.” Portsmouth City Council leader Gerald Vernon-Jackson added: “Every port in the country imports fertiliser. It will be trucked out, it won’t sit around.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather misery drivers long","story":"NewsUK weather: Misery for drivers as long queues leave them stuck in C heatLong delays have been reported on roads across the UK as Brits bask in the sunshine - with Cornwall, Lancashire, Essex and Wales among the areas worst affected todayShareByDave Burke:,  AUG NewsHeavy traffic as drivers head towards the south coast near Southampton \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Boris Johnson’s regime has further undermined its fragile trust by sticking up two fingers at people over the behaviour of privileged No adviser Dominic Cummings. In defying the growing clamour to respond to witnesses insisting they saw Cummings on a second lockdown-breaking visit to County Durham, suspicions understandably rise about what the Government has to hide. The head of Westminster’s all-party Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, has asked to “have the truth out in the open”. It is a legitimate appeal for transparency that a Downing Street confident of its position would be falling over itself to meet. Johnson giving Cummings a free pass symbolised the arrogance of a Prime Minister who behaves asrules are for the little people. If Cummings has evidence that he is not a serial offender, let him publish or be damned. Hard Prest PRESTON in Lancashire is the latest town to be put under local lockdown – worrying evidence that this virus is not beaten. This crisis could go either way, with the Office for National Statistics suggesting the number of infections in England may be levelling off – while experts on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies recently warned “it does not have confidence” that the vital R reproduction rate is below one in England.  Imposing local restrictions inconveniences families but the measures are necessary. It’s better to lock down areas where the virus surges now than risk a second shutdown of the entire country in the coming winter.

Luis Archuleta, , escaped a Colorado jail in  where he was serving time for shooting and wounding Daril Cinquanta in Denver three years earlier. Mr Cinquanta, , retired in  but lived by the mantra “you can run, but you can’t hide”, and never forgot about Archuleta. He kept in contact with “bad guys”, askingthey knew where the fugitive was. He drew a blank until June  when he received a mystery tip-off – leading to the FBI capturing one their “most wanted”.  Mr Cinquanta, who was shot once in the stomach, said tracking Archuleta became “like a hobby”. He said: “I have never given up on him. It just shows you, persistence does pay off. “I was cold calling people, bad guys, I went to their homes and most of the reception was not warm. I’m not real popular with bad guys’ families.” He said the caller handed Archuleta to him “on a platter”, saying: “I’ve thought about it, I’m going to tell you where he’s at.”  Cinquanta added: “He’s been wanted  years, I’ve been working on him  years and I found him. It feels wonderful. “I’ve gotten calls from all over from policemen who think it’s phenomenal.” Recalling the shooting, he said: “He looked like a bad actor. I confronted him. He put his arm back and was pulling a gun. I lost that battle. In those days, we didn’t have bulletproof vests and radios did not come out of our cars, so I had to crawl to the car to call for help.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.153769.jpg ","title":"alliance for independences bid for a holyrood super majority dubbed cynical","story":"A bid by a former SNP MSP to maximise the independence vote at Holyrood has been dealt a serious blow after the Greens refused to co-operate with the controversial plan.Green co-convener Patrick Harvie has rejected Dave Thomson’s Alliance for Independence , describing it as a “cynical” attempt to “game” the Holyrood system.Mr Harvie also said he was not inclined to work with Mr Thomson, who was an SNP MSP for almost a decade, because he had voted against same-sex marriage.Mr Thompson, a former MSP for Skye Lochaber and Badenoch, quit the SNP after -years’ membership to form the AFI, which aims to capture up to  Holyrood list seats by acting as an umbrella group for the smaller Yes-supporting parties outside the SNP.A key part of his strategy is to get the independence-backing Greens, Tommy Sheridan’s Solidarity party, the Scottish Socialist Partyand the newly formed Independence for Scotlandparty to join his alliance.The AFI has been created with the specic aim of attracting these parties to maximise the pro-independence representation at Holyrood.Mr Thompson plans to negotiate with them where their candidates should stand on the list system in order to boost the AFI’s chances of success.The organisation was formed in response to Holyrood’s electoral system, which was created to ensure parties that capture a high number of first-past-the-post constituency seats do not do so well when it comes to the top-up list seats, which are calculated by proportional representation.For example, at the last  Scottish election, the SNP did so well in the constituency vote – taking  out of  seats – that it won only four of the  top-up seats on the list system.Mr Thompson said the AFI would be contacting the Greens, Solidarity, the SSP and ISP shortly.“We will be inviting these four parties to come together with us and stand under the alliance banner. Our constitution is specically drawn up to allow for that. We have had discussions with the Electoral Commission over the principle of it. And we don’t anticipate any problem,” Mr Thompson said.“The only policy we will insist on is that they support independence and support the SNP Government in gaining independence. In all other matters, a small party can follow its own programme.”Our aim is to get anything from  to  of the regional list seats and, added to the SNP in terms of support for independence, that will give us a super-majority in parliament.”Dave Thompson of the Alliance for Independence The AFI will only field candidates for list seats and will encourage independence supporters to back the SNP in the constituencies.“We will be encouraging all Yes supporters to back the SNP, so they get the majority,not all, of the constituencies in Scotland next time. Our aim is to get anything from  to  of the regional list seats and, added to the SNP in terms of support for independence, that will give us a super-majority in parliament,” Mr Thompson said.But Mr Thompson’s overtures were roundly rejected by Mr Harvie, who added his voice to those who have accused the AFI of exploiting the rules to skew the parliament so it fails to represent the Scottish population as a whole.There is a huge dference between trying to put forward a distinct political proposition and trying to game the system and I think people will see through that as a transparently cynical move. I think it is more likely to leave people pretty disillusioned with that kind of game playing.”Patrick Harvie, Green co-convenerWhen askedhe would accept Mr Thompson’s invitation, Mr Harvie replied: “The simple answer to the simple question is no.”He added: “We have already selected our candidates for the election. But eventhat weren’t the case, Greens stand on a clear, well defined political .We have had Green MSPs elected in every single session of the Scottish Parliament and there is a huge dference between trying to put forward a distinct political proposition and trying to game the system and I think people will see through that as a transparently cynical move. I think it is more likely to leave people pretty disillusioned with that kind of game playing.”Mr Harvie, a well-known equality campaigner, also said he would not be willing to work with Mr Thompson because he had voted against same-sex marriage when he was an SNP MSP.“He’s part of the wing of the SNP that would have been opposed to equal marriage,” Mr Harvie said. “There is a real fundamental problem with asking people to join a political project with folk who don’t support their human rights.”The AFI has submitted its constitution to the Electoral Commission for approval and will hold an autumn conference at which potential Plan Bs to Nicola Sturgeon’s approach to independence are debated.Independence supporters have expressed frustration at the UK Government’s steadfast refusal to ignore Ms Sturgeon’s demands for a second independence referendum. Boris Johnson has ruled out granting the Section  Order required to pass the powers to hold a vote from Westminster to Holyrood.That sense of frustration has led to hardline independence supporters to call on the Scottish Government to explore a dferent route to splitting up the UK that would avoid a referendum that had been legally approved at Westminster.Plan B supporters have suggested an independence-supporting majority at next year’s Scottish elections should trigger the start of independence negotiations. Other suggestions have included a so-called “wild cat” unauthorised independence vote.Mr Thompson said these options would be debated at conference. But the alliance would not take a policy position on some of the most dficult and detailed issues surrounding independence, such as the currency, EU membership and the deficit.“One of the main aims is to get a second indyref and support the Scottish Government to get that. But we know that our members will wish to debate what happensthere is a continued refusal to grant a Section ,” Mr Thompson said.“So our membership will actually debate that at the end of September and we will come to a decision about what our position will be on it.”Responding to Mr Harvie’s remarks, Mr Thompson said the AFI would still be issuing formal invitations to the small parties and he hoped to discuss the situation with them, including the Greens.“We will wait until then to see what response we get,” he added.On Mr Harvie’s objection to the way he voted in the same-sex marriage debate of , Mr Thompson said he had since changed his views and would vote dferently now.As a Christian, Mr Thompson said he had followed the Church of Scotland’s discussions on the subject and had “thought and prayed a lot” about the issue.“I have no hesitation in saying that, as far as I’m concerned, I don’t believe homosexuality is a sin andI was in parliament voting on same-sex marriage again, I would actually support it,” Mr Thompson said.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We never normally get this number of people camping here.“I have no objection to people camping but surely there is no need to leave this amount of litter. There are no real facilities for litter, but people could be taking it home with them.”Scottish Water, which runs the loch and nearby Backwater Reservoir, said it had become increasingly frustrated at the “irresponsible behaviour of some visitors to the area, including so-called wild campers.”The utility company said fires were left on a beach, litter and rubbish was discarded at ious locations, pop-up tents and gazebos abandoned, and human excrement left behind.Brian McCarthy, Scottish Water’s reservoir manager, said: “All drinking water is monitored against stringent regulatory requirements and our treatment processes are designed to achieve these standards, but we would obviously urge people not to leave human waste near raw water reservoirs like Lintrathen in the first place.#We want everyone in the area to be able to enjoy the amenities around the reservoirs, as we do at reservoirs throughout Scotland, and to do so in a responsible way.”Councillor Julie Bell said she completely understood why people would want to enjoy the fresh air and go camping or for a day out at the beauty spot.“However, with the rights of access come the responsibilities enshrined in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code,” she said.“The culprits are not true ‘wild campers’ but are leaving a trail of destruction and mess. If they learn to respect the interests of other people,they truly care for the environment, andthey take responsibility for their own actions then they will become wild campers.”She said many local businesses were suffering from the impact of “thoughtless, destructive actions” while working so hard to rebuild, post-lockdown.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

So that’s why we wanted to create a hub where people can discover the huge number of amazing local businesses our city has.# vw, px\"  Abz.le provides an easy way to discover, browse and connect with local lestyle businesses across the city and shire. Website visitors can utilise their categories and tags # to filter by # as well as an amazing search .#For local businesses, they can sign up for a free listing on our website # and provide us with links to their website and social media, customer testimonials, photos and more,# Steph, , added.#This then generates a beautul page that people can browse and contact them through. We direct traffic to their own channels, and we have also had loads of enquiries from users through our website, that get sent directly to these businesses.#We also feature the passionate people behind these businesses on our blog, so everyone can learn about them, be inspired by them, and support them.#I’m definitely proud of abz.le. This was a passion project for our team, and the support we’ve received has been incredible.#We get regular messages saying what a good idea this is, and we’ve also received many messages from our listed businesses saying they’ve had orders directly off the back of their listing or our social media posts # that makes it all worthwhile.#It’s a project that will always remind us of lockdown and the challenging times we all faced, but this is a very positive thing to come out of that. And we get such a buzz from meeting new business owners, learning about why they started and what they’re passionate about, and sharing their stories.#Similarly to the abz.le initiative, North-East Now was also launched in order to promote local businesses battling through the Covid- pandemic.The initiative – which is driven by Aberdeen  Grampian Chamber of Commerce and supported by creative agency Hampton, Aberdeen Journals, Original  and VisitAberdeenshire – will share inspirational and positive stories, encouraging people to do what they can to support the local economies in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.Steph said: #We spoke with the North-East Now team before they launched their campaign, as we have similar goals in terms of helping people support local wherever possible.#So it was fantastic to hear about their plans, and have abz.le included on their website. It’s a great feeling to be part of a big buy local movement, all supporting one another to get the best results for our city.#Abz.le is still very new, so we want to raise awareness of our  so we can help as many people as possible. The iety of companies listed on our website is absolutely incredible # and we want them all to be discovered and supported.#To find out more about North-East Now, visit northeastnow.scotTo share your positive business story, please email stories@northeastnow.scotFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

As a result of the change, the Dons# home game with Livingston on Saturday, August  has been moved  hours to Sunday, August .Meanwhile, it is understood the SPFL are hopeful the Aberdeen v Hamilton this Wednesday and the Reds# trip to Celtic next weekend will go ahead as planned.A decision taken on Friday morning after a meeting between the Scottish Government, Scottish FA and SPFL resulted in the St Johnstone game being called off, despite early indications it was clear to go ahead.Cormack posted a video message on Friday morning asking for patience from supporters while the club ascertained the facts behind two players testing positive for Covid- and a further six requiring self-isolation. An internal investigation is already under way.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon condemned the actions of the players in her Friday lunchtime briefing, adding that she was #pretty furious# at the #completely unacceptable# situation.The city is already under additional lockdown measures after a Covid- spike, which has seen  new cases reported.Cormack, while saying the incident had undermined the work the club had done to resume football safely, admitted his gratitude at the club not being punished further.He said: “Given the signicant Covid- outbreak in Aberdeen, we fully understand why the Scottish Government has made this decision in the interests of public health.“With the pressure over this season’s fixtures, and the fact that we caused this problem, we were fully prepared to play the game tomorrow. We are very grateful that the decision has been to postpone, rather than forfeit the game.“I took the opportunity yesterday to apologise to both football and health authorities, and with our fellow premiership clubs today.“The clinical decision last night from the JRG that it was safe to play underlines the confidence the football authorities have in the robustness of our procedures and protocols. Regrettably, what has happened in the last few days has undermined all the hard work that has gone into keeping our players and staff safe. We are now dealing with this internally with the seriousness it deserves.“In the meantime, I’d like to reassure the relevant bodies, our fans and everyone associated with the club that our already rigorous measures are being forensically scrutinised and that no stone will be left unturned in ensuring that no-one is under any doubt about what must be adhered to.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The first positive inidual must isolate for  days as of Wednesday, while the other seven face  days of isolation.The decision meant eight Dons first-team stars would miss the Premiership game at St Johnstone tomorrow, as well as Hamilton#s Pittodrie visit on Wednesday and the trip to play Celtic at Parkhead next Saturday.An SFA SPFL Joint Response Group statement released last night said the televised game against Saints would go ahead, however, the Scottish Government has decided the game cannot take place at this time and must be postponed.Aberdeen city is currently in a local lockdown due to a spike in cases linked to a cluster of nightspots. All of the affected players were in a bar in the city centre after the - loss to Rangers on Saturday.The First Minister said: #They blatantly broke the rules agreed by the SFA, SPFL and Scottish Government. It is completely unacceptable.#This morning, the Scottish Government convened a meeting with the SFA and SPFL, and # following those discussions # the football authorities have confirmed the game between St Johnstone and Aberdeen in Perth will not go ahead.#It#s the right decision, we are expecting members of the public to behave in a highly precautionary manner right now and when a football club ends up with players infected with Covid, not through bad luck but through breaches of the rules, we cannot take even a small risk of them spreading it to other parts of the country.#Players are supposed to be in a #bubble# between their homes and the bio-secure Cormack Park training ground.The #furious# First Minister added: #Football has been given the go-ahead on the strict condition they abide by the strict conditions agreed. If they don#t do that, they put at risk theof the professional game.#I welcome Aberdeen#s statement they have reminded players of their obligations.#That#s important, footballers as we all know are role models and should behave accordingly.#It#s also important to remind the clubs to make sure their players are acting responsibly and in line with the guidance.#During the First Minister#s daily briefing, the SFA SPFL Joint Response Group released their own statement confirming the game was off, and it is as-yet-unclear whether the Dons# matches against Hamilton and Celtic will be affected.It said: #Following a meeting this morning between the Minister for Public Health, Sport and Wellbeing, Joe FitzPatrick, the Scottish FA Chief Executive, Ian Maxwell, and the Chief Executive of the SPFL, Neil Doncaster, to further examine the circumstances around the self-isolation of eight Aberdeen FC players, a request was received from Scottish Government # and agreement reached # to postpone Saturday’s Scottish Premiership match against St Johnstone.#There is an evolving public health outbreak in Aberdeen and the minister conveyed the need for additional work to provide further assurance around Aberdeen FC’s adherence to the agreed protocols.#Given the overriding responsibility to public health, the subsequent advice and discussion with the minister this morning means that the Joint Response Group must adhere to the request to postpone the match.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  Here  39 s how a New Union could keep us living apart together","story":"One suspects that the same fate may await his successor, Douglas Ross, as he is installed tomorrow following last weekrsquos coup. The MP for Moray has even less public profile than Mr Carlaw, who at least was known for selling cars.You wonder how long the party can survive this before it lapses into historical irrelevance. Of course, the Scottish Tory Party will always be kept alive by its umbilical relationship with the UK Conservatives. A relationship which is both its salvation and its curse.Murdo Fraser MSP, the former deputy Tory leader, wisely realised this after the  referendum and proposed a breakaway Scottish party, like the Canadian Liberals or the Baian CDU. But it ainrsquot gonna happen ndash certainly not under Mr Ross, who appears to want to continue banging away at the old dead Union themes.That no one is listening should be evident to everyone who looks at the opinion polls or talks to Scottish voters. A line has been crossed since Brexit. The Union as it is now is no longer viable. It has become a focus of discontent as Scotland is shoe-horned into a new UK internal market replacing the EU single market.There is another way. Over the past couple of years there has been talk in Unionist circles of a new Act of Union to cement the new post-Brexit relationship. The Prime Minister is thought to be interested in something dramatic that would redefine relationships in this ldquoawesome foursome, as he calls Britain.The unionist columnist Stephen Daisley put flesh on the bones in an article this week. This new Act of Union would, in his model, restore the sovereignty of Westminster in a unitary UK state. It would define what the powers of the Scottish Parliament are, instead of leaving them open-ended as is the case in the  Scotland Act.ldquoBring it on, says Nicola Sturgeon. On the face of it, this would seem like the ultimate power grab ndash abandoning all pretence that the Scottish Parliament is anything other than a talking shop, a unit of local government, Strathclyde Region writ large.And yet, there could be something in this New Union ideaturned upside down and used to recognise not subordination, but Scottish autonomy. It could even come in the form of a new Treaty of Union, as in , to embrace a new constitutional reality.Such a treaty would recognise that Scotland and England still want to be part of Great Britain, as it also said in . But it would start from the premise that Scotland is a country in its own right. That Scotland voluntarily relinquished its sovereignty in , but now intends to run its own affairs in a new legal partnership.This New Union would recognise that Scotlandrsquos Parliament exercises entrenched constitutional powers: something that was promised in the post-ldquoVow Scotland Act in , but wasnrsquot delivered, as the Supreme Court ruled in .This New Union would be regarded by diehard unionistas a capitulation: not so much an Act of Union as an Act of Disunion. However, it could also be the creation of a new Union of equals ndash one that draws on the past but recognises changed realities.Like the European Union, this Union would be a legally-binding partnership of nominally independent countries. It would be defined by a commitment to common economic, social and environmental objectives, free movement, human rights, common trading standards, mutual defence and a common currency.Giving Holyrood full economic powers, including tax and borrowing, but within the confines of a common currency, would keep Scotland within the tent, much as countries like Slovakia and Slovenia are within the European Union. They are both sovereign countries, but their currency is the euro, they obey the Maastricht stability rules on debt and accept Brusselsrsquo right to regulate trade and negotiate treaties on their behalf.Scotland would be in charge of most of its own affairs, but would remain part of a United Kingdom under the Queen. That this echoes  Independence White Paper, Scotlandrsquos Future, drafted by one Nicola Sturgeon, is no accident. That was not a prospectus for separation, but for confederalism, as some of us argued at the time.After all, what does Westminster really need from Scotland  It needs a common travel area, a viable internal market, a common currency, defence and mutual security. Thatrsquos really it. England doesnrsquot need the hassle and expense of the day-to-day running of Scotland it just needs a recognition that Great Britain still exists as a geopolitical entity and that the UK is a unitary economic space ndash just like the EU.This kind of relationship would make sense following Brexit. Scotland would cease to be a Barnett supplicant. The Scottish Government would have to take responsibility for managing economic affairs within the constraints of legally-binding Treaty obligations.I think Dominic Cummings would be all over this. I think Sir Keir Starmer might be too. A new Union that saves Britain from Balkanisation and emphasises solidarity and common interests would be supported by the Liberal Democrats.Indeed, it is not inconceivable that Ms Sturgeon might see some merit in an Act of Disunion. It gets her off the referendum hook and would allow her to claim that Scotland was becoming independent, not by conflict and disruption as in Catalonia, but through reasoned discussion and negotiation.At any rate, something has to be done. Britain finally leaves Europe in the New Year ndash just in time for the Holyrood elections, which promise to be a blood bath for the unionist parties. Boris Johnson canrsquot just pretend itrsquos business as usual. Offering more cash backed by dark threats wonrsquot wash.Scotland needs to be sorted so he can concentrate on Brexit. If and when the SNP wins a majority in Mayrsquos Scottish elections, the Prime Minister should show true Churchillian radicalism by offering his own Plan B ndash challenging Scotland to join a new partnership of equals.

With exams cancelled for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was left to teachers to estimate the grades a pupil could expect, and then the SQA would step in to moderate the result up or down. Not ideal, but this was an unprecedented situation, best that could be done in the circumstances, good intentions all round, autofill as required.Yet from the outset the most important part of the process, the moderation of results, was shrouded in mystery, like the recipe for some secret sauce. MSPs, teachers and others had asked for details of the methodology to be used, but details came there none until the day the results were published, when it was too late to do anything about it.As it turned out, the SQA has been less than moderate in its moderation, with a quarter of results, some ,, downgraded.Digging deeper, pupils from the most deprived areas were more likely to have their grades downgraded than those from the least deprived areas.

Postcode determined outcome, and once the downgrading began one domino toppled on to the next, right down to a predicted pass becoming a fail.As Lindsay Paterson, Professor of Education Policy at the University of Edinburgh, wrote in The Herald: ldquoItrsquos bad enough to know that you have been given a B instead of an A because of what previous students achieved in your school.ldquoBut to know you have failed a course because the SQA judged your teachers to be unreliable in making judgments is offensive.: Fears teachers will be overwhelmed by appealsOffence has duly been taken by pupils, their parents, and teachers alike, and no wonder. Once again, those Scots youngsters most in need of a fair shake have been shoved to the back of the queue through no fault of their own. All in the name, in the words of the SQA, of \"maintaining the integrity of the system.Had the results gone unmoderated, we are told by ministers, the pass rates would have risen to the highest on record.

There was the U-turn over plans for a partialto school, and now fresh turmoil caused by the SQArsquos downgrading of results.It has been a tough time for a lot of people, parents especially, but the answer does not lie in piling unfairness on to existing inequality, as the SQArsquos downgrading has done.Its next task is dealing with the thousands of expected appeals. On that the SQA should do what it promised in the first place and properly consult teachers.Instead of viewing teachers as biased towards their own pupils, think of them as professional observers whose opinions are as worthy of respect as your own.The Government needs to take a grip of the situation and fast, not just for the sake of current pupils but those that come after. It is possible, in the absence of a vaccine, that we could be in the same situation next year.The Scottish education system cannot take any more dunts to its reputation. It has nothing to do with some notion of national pride. It is about being serious when we say we believe in fairness and equality. It is about understanding the problems and addressing them as quickly as possible. It is about priorities.This Government has had  years to make a dference.

Mr Ross has already touched on this in his initial thoughts on the leadership ndash he would like more power to be shared out from Edinburgh and, as an Aberdonian like Mr Ross, I approve. Holyrood should not be the full-stop of devolution.Mr Rossrsquos roots in Aberdeen also, I think, may explain other parts of his political thinking. Much of Scotlandrsquos image as a place of radical politics was formed to the sound of the hammer and the pickaxe ndash it came from the shipyards and factories and coal mines, and because of that, Glasgow became the capital of Scotlandrsquos radicalism, first with Labour and now with the SNP.But the radicalism of Glasgow is not the whole story. In the Highlands, therersquos a much more liberal tradition, and the further north you go, the more liberal it gets, while up in Aberdeen and down in Dumfries-shire and the Borders, therersquos a strong streak of conservatism. In Aberdeen, some of it may come from our cautious natures: radicalism equals change, and we donrsquot like change.As Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross has the capacity to tap into those feelings, but therersquos an extra factor which may work in his favour in the way it did for Ruth Davidson. Mr Ross is not a Tory toff or the kind of Anglicised Scot that used to represent the Tories. Hersquos from an ordinary background and his views and instincts reflect what a lot of other Scots from ordinary backgrounds think.Take his call for ldquotougher enforcement against Gypsy Travellers for instance. The SNP immediately cried ldquoracist! before downgrading it to ldquoabhorrent!, but itrsquos perfectly fair to be concerned about illegal camps, and this is where the metropolitan effect kicks in again: middle-class, city liberals assume everyone thinks like they do, on race, sex, gender, or Brexit, but they donrsquot. Many Scots in large parts of the country are more cautious and conservative.The SNPrsquos tactic on all of this ndash and itrsquos already wobbled ndash is to portray Mr Rossrsquos conservatism as extreme, but actually he is from a Scottish tradition of right-of-centre pragmatic conservatism that still exists. Take his views on Brexit. The SNP said he had ldquofailed to stand up for Scotland by backing an extreme Brexit but he is merely taking the view that a lot of centrist Scots now take: we voted Remain but letrsquos try to get the best Brexit we can.Mr Rossrsquos common sense was also at work in the Dominic Cummings affair. He was the only minister to resign over it, saying he could not in good faith defend a government advisor who had travelled hundreds of miles during the initial stages of lockdown, and his resignation was a good sign for his future as Scottish Tory leader. If he erges from the rest of the UK party when he sees fit, as Ruth Davidson did, it will serve him well.All of these factors could help Mr Ross connect with voters in the centrist middleas well as a large part of conservative Scotland including the socially conservative working-class parts of urban Scotland. But the problem he has is that hersquos taking over during a public health crisis in which the SNP government is seen to be doing well. It is this, perversely, that has helped support for independence to edge over %: the less Nicola Sturgeon has talked about independence, the more people have supported it.The question is: what happens when le s to normality in Scotland ie the SNP banging on about independence every day  It was frustration with that approach among ordinary Scots ndash and Ruth Davidsonrsquos plain-speaking ability to capitalise on it ndash that led to the Tory surge in .

especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona - just skyrocketing in that demographic.ldquoItrsquos just that smouldering fire - but as more of them get infected, the chance of them interacting with the vulnerable population increases and hits that vulnerable population, and then the inferno just begins.ldquoThatrsquos when we end up with lots of sickness and lots of disease.The problem for politicians and public health experts is how to persuade a vast swathe of the population to take the threat of coronavirus seriously when, in reality, they are extremely unlikely to become critically unwell, let alone die.According to a study by experts in epidemiology and infectious disease at Stanford University, the risk of someone under  dying in the UK from Covid was equivalent to the chances of them dying in a car crash -

who are nonetheless equally capable of catching and spreading the infection, often without symptoms - flout the rules, the more cases will increase, and the more chance there is of the virus eventually reaching people who will get sick.But it is very challenging psychologically to link apparently harmless behaviour, such as sitting too close to too many people in a pub, to the potential to set off a chain of events that could culminate in a strangers hospitalisation.ldquoItrsquos about our risk to others, and that might make it a little more dficult to understand, says Cynthia Rohrbeck, an associate professor in clinical and community psychology at George Washington University.: Warning over surgery backlog as around , operations postponedHuman judgment is also clouded by optimism bias: the tendency to believe you are less likely than others to experience something negative.In February, researchers polled , people in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland and found half of them believed they were less likely to get the coronavirus than others, without any sound evidence for that belief.Our behaviour is also governed by the reward principle: put simply, we are more likely to follow the ruleswe perceive a personal reward, or benefit, to our actions.Not getting sick might be a reward - butyou already know that the statistics are stacked in your favour and, as time goes on, you dont fall ill, the motivation to comply flags.In trying to keep a lid on the pandemic as lockdown eases, we essentially face an uphill battle against human psychology.

Schools close and the reverberations hit the economy.. Parents begin to realise why teachers can spend up to four years in university learning the curriculum and how to teach it or, with Honours graduates, another year training to teach.. Teachers continue to work their fingers to the bone to convert deliver lessons online which the week before had been taught in class. They also deliver food parcels or anything  that it is within their power to aid their pupils.. Exams are cancelled and then Government backtracks on a decision to assess coursework, ignore teachers recommendations and trust the pupils futures to a statistical model and in the process, in regards to the efforts of teachers to continue despite all obstacles, adds insult to injury. Lets recall that old saying - \"theres lies, damned lies and then theres statistics\".. The reason for not assessing coursework of course was that poorer pupils may not have had access to laptops computers or parental support re home schooling. To assess the work would have provided evidence of the continuing disparity between social groups.. Consequently, that would have of course laid bare the lack of success in general in improving the lot of the working class, the \"levelling-up\" of society, closing the attainment gap, improving social mobility.. The model employed based on previous records, actually reinforces the attainment gap and now we have the statistics to prove it. Any occurrence of improvement is considered a mere blip on the graph the blip represents the hopes and ambitions of a human being.The whole process smacks of inertia in the face of adversity, compounding the calamity visited upon us. The lack of respect for the teaching profession by the Government is a disgrace. It now dictates that, not only do teachers pick up the pieces but risk their health in the process. It seeks to enlist more teachers to deal with the conditions Covid sets it will be fortunate to convince teachers in post to remain.Maureen McGarry-OHanlon, Balloch.THE SQA, by setting its historical precedent to downgrade students results on the grounds of the areas their schools were in, has delivered an almighty and metaphorical slap in the face to all those teachers who in all sincerity presented the grades they felt their students merited on the basis of their performances throughout their abbreviated certicate year. This decision has called into question the professionalism of the classroom practitioners.What is also inexcusable is the the degradation imposed upon the high hopes of pupils who were clearly A students by the devaluation of their efforts.As a former member of the profession, I can safely testy that a teacher knows an A student when the teacher sees one.No teachers worthy of the name would tamper with a students results, knowing full well that this would be to the detriment of a pupils future.There can be no doubt that the SQA was placed in a dficult situation as a result of the Covid- shutdown, but it ought to have shown more resilience and sensitivity in its approach to the delivery of results which should have reflected the reality of the actual performance of any student rather than the historical performance of any school.There can be no doubt that we will hear much more about this unhappy state of affairsDenis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.NICOLA Sturgeon says she wishes to be judged on her ability to close the education achievement gap between the better-off and the poorest in Scotland. A worrying aspect of the SQA fiasco is the fact that it seems designed to reinforce the achievement gap and even embed it in the system. By choosing to dictate that able students from poorer families cannot be given credit beyond some statistical average it sends the message that they shouldnt even bother trying.Given that the rules for Scottish university entrance favour middle-class EU applicants over working-class Scottish students, you would be forgiven for believing that, far from wishing to close the gap by improving the lot of our less-well-off, the SNP is designing a system which reinforces an already unfair disadvantage and bakes that disadvantage into the system, to the further detriment of working-class Scottish pupils.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.AND now for some facts.Those exam results were assessments by the teachers. You know, the folk who know the pupils. They were not by the Scottish Government or by John Swinney. They were presented to the SQA, the body that supervises exams in Scotland. It felt some of the assessments were a bit generous. So it marked them down a little. These amended results still show an improvement on previous years and, please note, the results from the schools in disadvantaged areas show the biggest improvement.

There is no evidence to explain exactly how they contracted the virus. It is worth considering that some of them may have been trying to stick to the regulations and simply fallen foul of circumstance.

That was the outcome they wanted.ldquoThere was a deal on the table, they didnrsquot accept that deal. The Welsh government accepted a deal, and the Scottish government took the deal back to the First Minister of Scotland and she rejected it.ldquoIn my view, and Irsquom not pretending to be objective, that was a circumstance she wanted.ldquoShe wanted to create an impression of disrespect of the Scottish government.ldquoI think it would have been perfectly possible to have reached agreement, and at the start I thought we would be able to reach agreement, but by the end of the process I did not think wersquod be able to reach agreement.ldquoWe were only able to get that legislation through because we got agreement in the House of Lords where there was a recognition that the stance taken by the Scottish government was an entirely political one. It wasnrsquot based on reason, having debated the minutiae of that for hours.Mr Mundell also said there was complacency in Whitehall after the  referendum.ldquoThere was an expectation that perhaps, certainly in the civil service lsquowell, wersquove had that referendum and wersquoll move onrsquo, when in fact we didnrsquot move on and we havenrsquot moved onhellip Itrsquos clear there will never be enough powers.

Theyrsquove replaced one unrecognisable leader with a man equally unknown. Outside of the political bubble most people would struggle to name him.

They see her as a safe pair of hands and her experience of leading the party will make her a good ally for Mr Ross to have while he is at Westminster. Having said that, the prominence she been afforded this week is an odd way for a new leader to establish themselves. But then, this whole changing of the guard has been baffling.With less than a year to go until the Holyrood elections the Scottish Tories have ruthlessly dispatched the middling, uninspiring ndash yet dependable ndash Jackson Carlaw for this chaotic leadership duo. With Mr Ross in the Commons and Ms Davidson in Holyroodthey have -for reasons only known to themselves - opted for a leadership tag team of sorts.There must be a cunning strategy in there somewhere but it must be of a calibre far beyond the comprehension of mere mortals because Irsquoll be damnedI can work out what it is.We now know a bit more about what provoked Mr Carlawrsquos sudden resignation. If the dark murmurings are true, it appears that Ms Davidsonrsquos hands were all over it. It was reported that Ms Davidson had met with Mr Ross in private a few days before Mr Carlaw came to the conclusion that he wasnrsquot the best man for the job. Or rather, when he was handed his jacket and firmly told told he wasnrsquot.These things happen in politics. Itrsquos a brutal business and the Tories are better than most at getting rid of leaders they are unhappy with. A new leader usually benefits from a honeymoon period where they command the airwaves and have a captive audience as they set their agenda.The Scottish Tories will be hoping that the highlight reel from the first few days of Mr Rossrsquos leadership doesnrsquot set the tone for whatrsquos to come.In one of his first interviews as leader, he defended his decision to keep his second job as an assistant referee by explaining that he thinks it will be a good way to unwind from the intense pressure of being the leader of a political party.We shouldnrsquot diminish what Irsquom sure is a very demanding and stressful role, but it doesnrsquot exactly inspire confidence does it  In the highly improbable event that Mr Ross ends up in Bute House he would be under immense pressure. His responsibilities would reach far beyond concerns about his MSPs drunk-tweeting or whether Ms Davidson is going to get too comfy in her new role.He insists he can find time for both jobs but you have to wonderthat can really hold,he is to be the kind of leader his party need right now.Tories, both north and south are in panic mode about the polls in Scotland showing a majority support for independence. As their very own Adam Tomkins said: ldquoFor the first time in Scottish history, independence now looks like it might not be the minority pursuit that itrsquos always been, but the position of a majority of Scots.rsquorsquoThe party have given their emphatic backing to Mr Ross as the person best placed to make the case for the crumbling Union. If hersquos to become an authoritative voice in Scottish politics hersquoll have to step out of Ruth Davidsonrsquos shadow ndash however comforting it is to have a former leader by your side ndash and become somebody worth listening to.Wersquove been told we shouldnrsquot underestimate Mr Ross: that he is ambitious and determined when he sets his mind on something. If the break-neck speed at which he took over the party is anything to go by, there certainly seems to be some truth in that.But the Scottish Tories need more than a simple refresh of their management team. Ahead of the Holyrood elections, theyrsquove got to broaden their message beyond the lsquorsquoSay no to a second referendumrsquorsquo fag packet manesto of recent years. If they have any hope of being taken seriously, their vision for Scotland will need to evolve into something with substance and credibility. Theyrsquove got to do that under the stewardship of a new leader who already looks at risk of being upstaged by Ms Davidson. And while theyrsquore at it: therersquos the small matter of actually making a positive case for the Union, which they appear to have nothing new to say on.The job-sharing set-up between Mr Ross and Ms Davidson will only reinforce the perception that the Scottish Tories are controlled by Westminster. When Holyrood s from recess and the Sturgeon v Davidson show gets under way, Mr Ross will be hundreds of miles away, praying that his stand-in remembers to mention him by name. Worse still, the first time he faces Nicola Sturgeon in a debate will be during the Holyrood election.

It is, however, worth looking at the options. The first one would have been not to certicate this year that would have been a severe blow to candidates, effectively costing them a year of their le. The second option was to use centre evidence such as prelim materials, on which to base results. For this to happen even on the basis of sampling, this required a large number of examiners in markersrsquo meetings to set and enforce common standards, at a time when offices were shutting and the SECC was being converted to the Louisa Jordan. By default,certication was to take place at all, it had to happen on the basis of centre estimates.Using estimates by candidatesrsquo own teachers has merits ndash the teachers know the candidates. It also has drawbacks ndash the teachers know the candidates. In addition, there may be pressure from parents. For whatever reason, in overall terms the raw estimates of passes provided by teachers were not at the level of around  per cent as in previous years, but nearer  per cent. This is the crux of the problemteachers had estimated in line with past awards, for their centres and overall, the fall-out would have been much less.Here too it is instructive to look at the options. The SQA could have accepted all the estimates and certicated a uniquely high pass rate in a year when there had been less teaching than in the past, this would have tainted the awards forever. Alternatively, SQA could have reduced all awards to previous levels that would have meant almost no centre or pupils would have achieved their estimated grades were there to be an appeals system in place, every candidate would have been eligible. That was not a sustainable position. The third option was to align awards on the basis of which centres had been most accurate in providing estimates in the past. While not perfect, there is no other game in town. The drawback in this system is that candidate performance is more iable and less predictable in areas of greater social deprivation candidates face a range of pressures both inside and particularly outside school that impact on performance, especially in external examinations. This indeed is what happened but, again, there was no other viable option and it would seem that the SQA did apply some mitigation of these effects.He was right on the second count too. Much of the criticism seems politically motivated. Unionists of all hues take an unseemly delight in blaming the SNP Government for this unfortunate coincidence of circumstances. Back in , when StQA experienced another crisis, the blame was directed largely at the SQA, rather than the Labour-LibDem coalition which had foisted Higher Still upon it.Laurence Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.THE recent outcry over the SQA awards shows how biased, outdated and unfair this qualications body is. Had all centres been downgraded then it would just have shown how distrustful it is of teachers. However, the unfairness of its awards is clearly evidenced by the fact that the predicted grades of private schools have been upgraded whilst those of secondary schools in less affluent areas have been downgraded.Having worked in both sectors I know that not all pupils attending private schools are particularly clever. Indeed many parents choose to send their children there either because they are not especially clever, or because they do not have the aptitude for learning. I know that there are many exceptions to this and I also know that there are many pupils in state secondary schools who also are reluctant learners. However, I have also had the privilege and pleasure of teaching many pupils in state schools who have been truly gted and have gone on to professions such as medicine, law and in academia itself. I am just thankful that their merit was not judged in such a cavalier fashion as the present students have been.What this fiasco shows is that an examination of the SQA is long overdue. Having worked as a marker for it I found it a very heavy-handed and arrogant institution. No-one was ever allowed to question decisions about exemplar marked scripts we were given, even when some were very dubious. Now I mark for GCSE Literature and the attitude down south is very dferent. There, there is competition between examining bodies and, as a result, not only are markers treated as professionals, but our questions and, sometimes objections, are listened to and acted on. I think itrsquos about time that the monopoly of the SQA should be challenged.Rita Carey, Glasgow G.NICOLA Sturgeon rejects criticism from Professor Lindsay Paterson, one of Scotlandrsquos leading experts on education, that the basis for reducing grades had been ldquoarbitrary. So all of a sudden, Ms Sturgeon is an expert of equal standing on education. I know who I believe and so will thousands of school children in mostly deprived areas, who did well in their course work and prelims, but were strangely marked down and who dont believe her withering excuses either.It is also very strange why this year the appeals process is free, which makes me think the SNP knew the results were skewed against our less well-off areas, and has very quickly granted free access to appeals.Michael Miller, Falkirk.PRESCRIBED text for John Swinney: The Leadership Class in Scottish Education by Walter Humes .

But while reusable grocery bags and regular trips to the bottle bank are standard practice for most of us, the circular economy principles underpinning these good habits have not yet filtered through to our approach to land.Scotland has almost , hectares of vacant and derelict land ndash roughly twice the size of Dundee - and much of it sits in areas with the greatest poverty and deprivation.To help address this the Scottish Land Commission, along with SEPA, established the Vacant and Derelict Land Taskforce to transform Scotlandrsquos approach to bringing such land back into use.Bringing sites back into a positive use has transformational potential for many communities across Scotland where dereliction is having a detrimental impact on their lives and local environment.The Taskforce believes that bringing these unloved urban spaces back into a productive end-use can deliver wider benefits for the local environment, community and economy.For example, the sites could be used to:bullBuild new homes to limit urban sprawl and reduce commutingbullProvide new allotments and city farms for fresh food grown locallybullCreate new parks, green space and net works to enhance existing bioersity value and improve wellbeingbullAttract new investment, creating jobs and wealth in parts of the country that need it mostbullGenerate renewable energy, potentially helping to tackle fuel poverty in poorer communities.The legacy of Scotlandrsquos industrial past means that almost a third of the Scottish population currently lives within  metres of a derelict site.In deprived communities health outcomes that figure increases to %. Decisions about what to do with a vacant site, includingand when to dispose of it, are most often made on the basis of fairly narrow cost-benefit analysis.Anticipated financial s to the owner are usually the most important consideration and when these numbers donrsquot stack up, nothing happens. Sites in areas with inherent problems are an even weaker prospect for generating reuse. A longer-term, broader and more collaborative community led approach to land reuse is required ndash and one which emphasises and values the benefits that reuse can bring.The Commission has published a framework that places wellbeing as a central consideration when assessing the business case for reusing vacant or derelict land.Head of Policy at the Scottish Land Commission, Shona Glenn, explains: ldquoWe think the time has come to update and develop the traditional approaches to assessing the benefits of reusing land to reflect the broader perspective on economic wellbeing and properly reflect the way our environment affects every aspect of our lives.ldquoThese changes could help to signicantly reduce land dereliction in urban Scotland, which could make a major contribution to efforts to address climate change, but it could also address another challenge of our time, one which has been heightened even more by the impact of the pandemic ndash inequality.Making sure we own and use our land in productive ways will be even more important in building a fair and green recovery in Scotland. We simply cannot afford not to unlock ndash through land - greater economic, social and environmental wellbeing for people in both urban and rural Scotland. www.landcommission.gov.scot #notsoprettyvacant-----------------------------------------------If you want to make your money matter, invest in the green economyOrbital Marine Power are developing floating tidal turbines in OrkneyMORE and more people in the UK are realising that when it comes to responding to the climate emergency and the need to transition to a sustainable green economy, your money really does matter.As Earth Overshoot day approaches, there are many actions you can take as an inidual to be greener but few things are more effective than making sure your money is having a positive impact when it comes to the environment.In fact, it has been calculated that moving your money to green investments is  times as effective at reducing your carbon footprint than eating less meat, using public transport, reducing water use, and flying less combined, according to the new campaign from world renowned film maker Richard Curtis.Make My Money Matter launched in June with a call for everyone to get their pension to offer sustainable and green investments. With the introduction of workplace pension auto-enrolment, millions of workers now have a pension pot, but relatively few have been offered, or made aware of, a green or sustainable option for their money.At Abundance Investment, our nearly , crowdfunding investors have raised more than poundm for projects across the UK, including more than poundm invested into businesses in Scotland. These include Orbital Marine Power , who are developing innovative floating tidal turbines and Celtic Renewables in Grangemouth transforming whisky waste into biofuel and other useful products.Each of our investors is using money in their ISA or pension to buy investment bonds in green and socially positive businesses which pay a twice-yearlyon their investment. Investment always involves risk and Abundance is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority to make sure the risks of the investments are clear and understood as well, as the environmental and financial benefits. It is not only about innovations in sustainability or energy generation from renewables, every industry in the UK will need to invest to transition from carbon intensive to carbon neutral or even net positive technologies. Abundance investors are also helping farmers such as Robert Greenow who has set up Agrogen PLC to build new ways to generate energy from the waste produced from growing our food, and there is a growing pipeline of investments for new forms of sustainable farming technologies such as vertical farming.The crisis caused by the Covid pandemic has only heightened the calls for greater efforts to speed the UKrsquos recovery from the economic impact of the lockdown with investment in green jobs and infrastructure ndash now at a local level led by local councils. The UKrsquos first local government green bond was issued this month by West Berkshire, with Warrington and Leeds planning their own green bonds for their residents to invest directly with their council from just pound. West Berkshire are installing poundm of solar generation to support their push to beat the UKrsquos Net Zero target by  years through achieving that goal for their region by .These lsquoCommunity Municipal Investmentsrsquo also offer the opportunity for people to invest in long term projects such as afforestation, wild flower planting and other forms of bioersity and natural environment improvements.These will provide investors with a lower risk option for their money and local councils with a lower cost method of financing their investments in their local environment and economies. As the UK government explores the idea of a new green investment bank, Abundance aims to help turn all  local authorities into local green investment banks backed by municipal bonds invested in by citizens who want to put their money to work towards a greener, more sustainable recovery.The challenges of the last few months have shown the power of pulling together and taking collective action. As iniduals we have a responsibility to think about how our money is invested and the impact it has on the worldrsquos finite ecological resources.----------------------------------------------Nature needs to be on the finance agenda for recoveryBy Chris Tait, Executive Manager, Global Ethical Finance InitiativeIN NOVEMBER , Glasgow will host the UN climate change summit, known as COP. This is the most important climate summit since the landmark Paris Agreement in  when heads of state committed to restricting global temperature rise this century to lsquowell belowrsquo degC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to .degC. COP is first opportunity for nations to come together to review commitments and strengthen ambition.Scotland is already leading by example with the Climate Change Bill making a commitment to becoming a net-zero society by  ndash five years before the rest of the UK. The Scottish Government has also responded to the global climate emergency by adopting an ambitious new target to reduce emissions by  per cent by . The Scottish National Investment Bank, which will be operational in the second half of , will support the transition to net zero through a range of debt and equity products.With Earth Overshoot Day looming later this month it is timely to reflect on the key role nature plays in regulating climate as well as helping us to adapt to and mitigate against climate change. By conserving nature and restoring ecosystems we reduce climate vulnerability and increase resilience.The sustainable management and use of nature can help tackle wider socio-environmental challenges such as water security, water pollution, food security, human health and disaster risk management. However, with ecosystems declining in size and condition by  per cent globally, and species populations facing extinction, the wake-up call on nature loss arrived at this yearrsquos World Economic Forum where, for the first time, the Global Risks Report ranked bioersity loss as one of the top-five global risks in terms of likelihood and impact in the next  years.Around  trillion of economic value generation ndash over half the worldrsquos total GDP ndash depends on nature and its services and sustainable use of our environment in Scotland accounts for  per cent of our total economic output ndash worth pound. billion a year ndash and one in seven full-time jobs. The global coffee market had retail sales of  billion in  but  per cent of coffee ieties are at risk of extinction from a combination of climate change, disease and deforestation.Nature and bioersity loss therefore represent a signicant financial risk. Insufficient accounting for the risks posed by nature loss have unintended consequences, such as short or long-term risk mispricing, inadequate capital buffers, and in extreme cases the potential for stranded assets.In boardrooms nature loss continues to be largely a hidden risk. This needs to change, and quickly. The Scottish-based Global Ethical Finance Initiativeis working with the United Nations Development Programme and Scottish Government on a  year programme of collaboration that aims to raise awareness and position nature at the forefront of the COVID- economic recovery and for the long-term well-being of people and the planet.Within the programme, which forms part of our wider Path to COP campaign, we are actively looking to develop a financial instrument that accelerates nature-friendly investments at scale as well as draw upon our extensive global network to support other initiatives such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Wildle Trustrsquos challenge to unlock pound billion of new investment for nature conservation in Scotland. We are also looking to explore the feasibility of a global framework for financial institutions measure and disclose nature-based risk.With Covid- exposing the fragility of health security and financial systems there is a pressing need to build social, environmental and economic resilience.At GEFI, as we approach COP, we are committed to working with our partners ensure nature joins climate at the top of the finance agenda to underpin a green and sustainable recovery. We will also continue to showcase and position Scotland as a leading global centre for ethical finance. www.globalethicalfinance"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-get-quizzical","story":"Question  Do you read the Herald Diary a Yup.

This could be a golden opportunity to re-establish equal delivery costs for islanders –the Chancellor will take these calls seriously.“Almost every family in the Highlands and Islands, myself included, has a story about being overcharged for deliveries. In some cases delivery costs can be even higher than the product itself. Unreasonable charges are a barrier to growth and ease of living. This has to change.”He continued: “Delivery charge inequality affects communities represented by a wide range of parties, from Moray to Unst to Belfast.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The SQA then checked and validated the information received. According to the council, moderations to the results, up or down, have been made by the SQA,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and consistency with results from previous years.Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC education, leisure and housing committee said that all had stepped up to the challenges set before them during these unprecedented times.“Never before have the exams been cancelled, so it has been a steep learning curve for all involved and we must acknowledge the efforts of our teaching staff here in Orkney in making these dficult decisions — it is not easy when you know you are playing a part in determining the onward learning journey of students.#But teachers and lecturers are best placed to have a strong understanding of how their learners have performed and, based on their experience and the evidence available, what a learner would be expected to achieve in each course. I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study. We are pleased that the overall pass rate across Orkney’s schools remains strong at  per cent – the same as last year’s pass rate.“When schools and college stafffrom the summer holiday detailed analysis of the results will take place, subject by subject, enabling the Council to evaluate trends, build on success and establish where any improvements may be needed.#We remain committed to assist in whatever way we can in helping all students move forward into positive destinations.”Kirkwall Grammar School head teacher, Don Hawkins, expressed his pride a the quality and amount of work carried out by staff to ensure the best possible outcomes for the young people of KGS.He said: “This can also be a time of incredible pressure for our young people and for some this will be a period of extreme anxiety, especiallytheir grades don#t match up to their expectations or hopes.“My message to all young people is that there is no one pathway.  No one’s journey will be exactly what they hoped for.  Congratulations on your success andthe results are not what you had wished, pick yourself up and try again.  As someone once said ‘there is no disgrace in being knocked down, there is only shame in not getting back up never quit!’.#Your parents and teachers will be there to provide you with the support and guidance you need to adapt the plan your pathway going forward.#Orkney schools and other local organisations are on hand to help pupils who are concerned about their exam results, or who just want some advice on what to do next.

The village of Dounby is only slightly older.The story begins with Hosen Market, which was held three times a year at Geoth, north-east of the present village. According to my grandmother, Johina Leith, nee Kirkness, who was born at nearby Newhouse in , and wrote some notes on Dounby, the market began at Hosen in Birsay but drted across the parish boundary to Magz o’Geoth’s ale-house.Grandma was told that, after Magz gave up her ale-house, JosephMackay, who had built the Smithfield Inn, was responsible for the market’s next move.“It would be good for business to have the market near the ale house, so Josie marshalled public opinion into taking up a public subscription to buy a stance nearby with proper title deeds. According to George Wylie, in his book, Showyard on the Heather, , the subscription to buy the land was raised in . But Josie and the market had arrived on that spot almost simultaneously, four years earlier.The West Mainland Agricultural Society was formed in . Two years later, they advertised a Cattle Tryst at Dounby, “for the dispersal of the Best Fat and Grazing Stock of the district.New roads and steamships meant that farmers could export and Dounby Farm, between the main Harray and Birsay road and the new junction road through Sandwick, was the obvious place to sell animals.  is also the year that Josie bought land at the junction from Magnus Smith, owner of Dounby Farm, and built his inn. He married Margaret Davie from Firth in  and by the following year, according to the Orcadian, inn and market were thriving.“The market stance at Dounby, it is believed, is the best in the mainland… It is central and easy of access from all quarters, being held at the intersection of two roads. There is a good and commodious inn on the ground, conducted in a superior manner by Mr and Mrs Mackay, where a iety of refreshments can be had and a rest enjoyed. Sometime in the s, Josie built the larger Smithfield, which held the inn, the Post Office and one or two other businesses over the years. Grandma thought that it was probably the Post Office who fixed the name of Dounby Farm onto the village. It was certainly settled by , when the Dounby Public School opened.The first Dounby Show was held on a field loaned by William Hourie, tenant of Dounby Farm and was a great success. There were over  entries and more than  spectators. I was amazed to find that my g-g-grandfather, Robert Leask of Coldomo, Stenness was one of the prize-winners. It must have been quite an operation to get the animals to the Show then. Grandma had fond memories of the days before cattle trucks.“At one time it was interesting to watch the animals come up from Dounby, past the corner and then turn for Harray, Birsay or Evie, each with their tickets on. At the dinner in the Smithfield Hotel on the evening of the first Show, it was suggested that there should be a Flower and Produce Show and it was held in the Dounby School just six weeks later. After that first year, the two shows were on the same day and the crowds flocked to Dounby.The stock show was held on Dounby Farm until the Society bought five acres of uncultivated land from James Flett of Curcabreck in  and built a wall around it.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

be fully digital and streamlined.The measures are needed because the Northern Ireland protocol requires it to remain in alignment with EU rules on goods, effectively creating a regulatory border in

destined for Ireland or the EU pay tarfs when they should.The Trader Support Service will take care of those on businesses’ behalf at no cost, with officials indicating it should be seen as an enduring commitment rather than a short-term fix.The new service is outlined as part of the publication of new guidance on the protocol for businesses moving goods into and from Northern

In a joint statement issued on Thursday night by the Northern Ireland Teachers’ Council, Irish National Teachers’ Organisation and NASUWT, they said concerns about the safety of staff and pupils remained.NITC said that it fully supported the minister in “seeking a fullto normality for all pupils as soon as it’s safely possible”, but the Department of Education had not supplied “updated information” which brought a change in the guidance originally issued in June.Justin McCamphill of the NASUWT added: “The statement from the minister, as usual, lacks sufficient clarity and detail. “The changes to the New School Day Guidance announcedwill force principals and teachers to again redraft and unpick physical changes which they have already laboured to put in place.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseWe Are Vertigo staff getting ready for business in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappWe Are Vertigo staff getting ready for business in Belfast’s Titanic QuarterThe introduction of compulsory face coverings for shops and all public enclosed spaces has been welcomed by the British Medical Association.“This virus is still very much circulating in the community and the most recent statistics from the Department of Health tell us that the number of positive tests per-day has increased three-fold from early July,” said Dr Alan Stout, chair of BMA’s Northern Ireland general practitioners committee, “The recent relaxation of social distancing rules from two metres to one metre means people are at greater risk of being exposed to Covid-. It is vital that we don’t become complacent.”The Executive had this week launched a public information drive to raise awareness of the benefits of face coverings. The ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign will now be rolled out over the coming weeks and will help inform the public why they must wear a face covering to help stop the virus’s spread.Mrs Foster said: “Retail workers will not have to wear masks, it’s those people coming in to the shops that we are asking to wear masks.“It’s about trying to give confidence to people who feel vulnerable and maybe have been shielding and we are asking the public to work with us and listen to what we are asking them to do.”The First Minister also announced a high street task force to help the sector, which was last night welcomed by Retail NI.On Thursday the Public Health Agencyrevealed that  coronavirus clusters had been identied in Northern Ireland since May , when the test and trace programme began.Currently  of these clusters remain open and some  cases of Covid- have been associated with these clusters.Nine of the clusters have had five or more cases associated with them. Earlier this week two businesses in Newcastle, Co Down — a sweet shop and an amusement arcade — closed temporarily following virus outbreaks among staff. The  new cases on Thursday brings the total to ,. No further fatalities were reported, leaving the death toll at , according to departmental figures.A total of  people have tested positive for the virus in the last week.Thirty-eight of these were in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area,  in Mid and East Antrim, and  in Belfast.There are currently two Covid- inpatients in hospitals here, with two being treated in intensive care units.In care homes there are currently three active outbreaks of the virus.Addressing the clusters, Dr Gerry Waldron, head of health protection at the PHA, said: “In the past seven days five clusters have been identied. Thirty-five cases have been associated with these clusters, with  close contacts.“This should act as a timely reminder that we must not become complacent. “Coronavirus remains in circulation and we have seen an increase in cases in recent weeks.”Mr Swann added: “This figureunderlines the fact that the threat from the virus remains very real. “If anyone still thinks Covid- is going to fade away, let them think again. “We must all do everything we can to stop the spread of this virus.”  Belfast   Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_deeec--e-b-fdeefe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_deeec--e-b-fdeefe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_deeec--e-b-fdeefe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_deeec--e-b-fdeefe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_deeec--e-b-fdeefe_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandFace coverings to become compulsory in all enclosed public spacesFace coverings will be mandatory in all public enclosed spaces from Monday, the Northern Ireland Executive has agreed.JobsNI bakery chain closes two stores permanently after coronavirus impactA bakery chain has announced the permanent closure of two of its stores in Co Down and Co Armagh due to the Covid- pandemic.GalleryFood, Drink and Hospitality#Thousands of jobs at risk# over decision to delay reopening wet pubs, says hospitality chiefThe decision to delay the opening of pubs that don#t serve food has been described as catastrophic for the industry.Most ReadI knew the ocean would take him, says grieving son of Brian BlackCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new cases reportedTributes for teen from Ballymoney killed in plunge at Wicklow waterfallPictured: Man arrested in connection with Belfast security alerts released as police urge East Belfast GAA players to check carsCoronavirus: Face coverings to be mandatory in shops and reopening of #wet# pubs postponed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Northern Ireland Executive announced on Thursday that key groups of pupils willto school from August  while all children should be back in class by September.Revised New School Day guidance will be published next week setting out an updated approach to the full reopening of schools.Read More All children to be back in school by September – NI ExecutiveTrade union Unison - which represents more than , education workers - says the school reopening plan is causing anxiety among its members.Another trade union - Unite - has threatened legal actionthe Northern Ireland Executive does not give further assurances about the safety of bus drivers when schools .A Unison spokeswoman said on Friday night: We have been engaged in continuous joint union discussions with the department and education bodies on a pilot plan for the safeof children and workers alike. That plan has now been set aside for what appear to be political rather than public health reasons.Like everyone  we want to see our schools reopen but our members and our school children cannot be put at risk.The latest ministerial announcement is causing anxiety for parents, pupils and education staff.Unite spokesman Michael Dornan told BBC Radio Ulster#s Talkback programme on Friday that he was greatly concerned about guidance in place to protect Translink school bus drivers.The union has arranged an emergency meeting on Monday with Translink senior management to discuss their concerns.He said: About four weeks ago, when social distancing was reduced and more passengers were allowed on board the Transport Minister Nichola Mallon added additional protection by making face masks mandatory.We have yet to hear of any guidance from the education minister about additional protection [for bus drivers].He added: It is very, very concerning for us and we would be forced to take some form of mandatory action in order to bring this to the attention of the education [Department] and Translink.We want to see what the added protection the education minister is coming up with. We want to see how the driver deals with children boarding buses. We want to know how we deal with older children - should they be wearing masks, should they not be wearing masks Mr Dornan said Unite could seek to challenge the government legally or industrially.If the risk increases for drivers they could possibly refuse to do it, he added.Responding on Friday night, Minister for Education Peter Weir said: We are still operating in a pandemic and we all have a vital role to play in ensuring that hygiene and public health measures are adhered to by all to allow our children and young people a safeto education.I am confident that our school leaders and staff will rise to the challenge and ensure all pupils cansafely to education full-time.A Translink spokeswoman said: We are working closely with the relevant agencies to make arrangements for school transport ahead of the new school term, ensuring adherence to Government guidelines. We will also follow guidance from the Department of Education, which is due to be published next week.

But most of all we need the public to support our industry.Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industryhas set our six ways of coping in the event of a local lockdown.The organisation#s Northern Ireland director Angela McGowan it#s about building confidencenew temporary restrictions are implemented.Businesses know thatinfection rates spike in an area then new local lockdowns may well be required to protect public health, she said.Local lockdowns are how governments manage the risk of infection and reopening the economy safely, so we must get good at them. The local Executive will need to act fast on new information, so there may be limited notice, but we must aim for a #no surprises# approach as far as possible.

There are a two distinct political jurisdictions born out of the Good Friday Agreement - we have acknowledge the reality of that, Mr Martin said. However, the Taoiseach said what happens in Britain impacts in Ireland and noted that English nationalism was the driving force behind the successful Brexit referendum and added that Scotland may some day break away from the UK.  What happensEngland gets turned off Northern Ireland  We#ve got to be thinking all this through, he added.This prompted Mrs Foster to denounce the comments, remarking that the rest of the UK cannot sever its constitutional links with Northern Ireland, pointing out that a united Ireland can only be achieved with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, as outlined in the Belfast Agreement.

It does not threaten our constitutional position or what we believe in so I don#t feel threatened at all by the shared island unit, she explained.TUV leader Jim Allister was critical of her remarks, insisting it would be unwise for unionism to adopt her laissez-faire response to the Taoiseach#s Shared Island Unit.Speaking on Friday, Mr Allister said the plans by Dublin and nationalist parties for a united Ireland need to be taken seriously by unionists and countered.The pandemic has demonstrated the benefits of Northern Ireland#s place in the UK, he added.Unionism needs to be proactively countering the arguments of nationalism about the future, not ignoring them or dismissing them out of hand.

And in  the Belfastlaunched its morning AM edition in tabloid format. Thebecame fully tabloid size on March , . Today it is Northern Ireland#s most popular newspaper - with millions reading both online and print editions. Fty years ago, to mark our centenary the Tele ran ‘The Kind of Ulster I Want’ competition. The young people of Northern Ireland in  were invited to pen a short essay detailing their hopes and dreams for peace and harmony in the future - and what NI would look like in the future.. At the time, -year-old Valerie McCambley, winner of second prize in the - age group, won a £ voucher which she said she would be putting towards a trip abroad with school the following year. “We must realise now before it is too late, that we are tomorrow’s Ulster,” wrote Valerie. “We must affirm that  is now for our history books, but  is for us.”Meanwhile, Jeffrey Nelson, from Belfast, wrote that he “would like to see Ulster full of happy people who have nice homes and who live in peace with their neighbours”.He said he was going to buy an Action Man with “real hair” with his £ consolation voucher. As we gear up to celebrate  years of publication, the Belfastwould love to hear from those past competition winners to find out what they make of Ulster in  - how they ended up spending their voucher.

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars.

It was compassion - a compassion that bubbled over in the cemetery in Greysteel that drove John on the final and often lonely and always dficult road to peace.Fr Farren said this desire to create peace came at a heavy cost.He added: Even in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others. His vision revealed what could be and with time and determination and single-mindedness and stubbornness he convinced others that peace could be a reality. He never lost faith in peace and he never lost faith in his ability to convince others that peace was the only way.

But not the Nash family.Our family always voted for John, even in those early days, says Kate.Mummy would almost come into the booth with you at elections to make sure you voted for John, laughs Linda.Up in Creggan, he was always therea family was having trouble with the army or anything like that.All he seemed to want to do was help people. And it was genuine concern. He wanted a better world for us, said Kate.Hume#s views on equality and dialogue didn#t always sit well with his political opponents and commentators. But Kate says this was not the case locally.Ordinary people always respected John Hume, and they knew he had their best interests at heart. He was an honest man.Other political forces around at the time wouldn#t have appreciated that.He was a powerful man and one of the best to come out of this country. He did so much. He was the peacemaker.A non-violent man. I#m sure there were times he must have been afraid. He went right up to the British soldiers and remonstrated with them. They could have knocked him clean out - or worse. They didn#t care.I was sad to miss it, but I haven#t been well, and I respected what Pat Hume said.I have my candle lighting for him all day.We were lucky to have him. He did so much for this town.And Hume was one of the founding members of the credit union.I joined it about  years ago, and that is how I have lived my le, says Kate.Anything I have needed, that#s where I would have got the money. You could afford to go there and get a loan. It was a leline for lots of people.John Hume was a very special human being. He was non-sectarian, and he never changed. He treated everybody the same.And that#s the way you would like the whole world to be.Gerry Murray was taught history by Hume at St Columb#s College  years ago. They later became friends through the SDLP.Mr Murray went on to study history at Trinity College Dublin and often travelled with Hume to college debates.He was the world#s worst driver. He could sit there for hours, saying nothing, but his mind was churning around.He would suddenly ask a question like, #Who do you think was the best American president #, says Mr Murray. John thought it was Kennedy, he adds.I used to go out campaigning with him in , and he was adored. The people of Derry respected him greatly. There was universality about him. He could talk with anyone.If things weren#t going well for him politically, he could rely on Derry people for support.I was with him one day, and we walked into Da Vinci#s bar, and this boy turned to him and said: #Don#t let the bastards get on top of you John, just keep going#.And as it transpired the man who said that was a republican but he wanted John to succeed. They admired him.That said, some of the people now saying he was a great peacemaker tried to burn his house down. That is what he and his family had to put up with.In a historical context, he was a major figure. Unlike O#Connell and Parnell, he achieved what he set out to achieve.I watched the funeral, and it was very strange not to be there.Seeing Pat and the children, who I would have known growing up, I was half expecting to see John pop into view.He almost seemed to be there without being there. You#d half expect him to turn around and say, #Well, what about ye #It was both heartbreaking and very uplting watching the funeral.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMourners lined the streets as John Hume#s coffin leaves St Eugene#s Cathedral.

Ulster Unionist Party councillors on Belfast City Council Jim Rodgers and Sonia Copeland have criticised Sinn Fein Councillor Ronan McLaughlin over his comments that Roselawn cemetery is unwelcoming for Roman Catholics.There is not a grain of truth in this statement, the two councillors said on Friday.Last week, Belfast Sinn Fein councillor Ronan McLaughlin told a Belfast City Council meeting that the city#s nationalist and republican community believes that the Roselawn cemetery and crematorium is not a welcome place for them.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRonan McLaughlin of Sinn Fein FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRonan McLaughlin of Sinn FeinCouncillor McLaughlin made the remarks as he requested an additional equality assessment into plans to locate Northern Ireland#s second crematorium in Roselawn, close to the existing one.A second facility for the site is planned, with an estimated cost in the region £m, and which it#s expected will take up to two years to build. The existing building - which is listed - will be refurbished inside and used by staff.At a meeting of the council#s strategic policy and resources committee meeting, Councillor McLaughlin said: What we have seen recently in Roselawn is the display of what can only be described as a hate banner that was very sectarian in nature.Me and my party colleagues have had people contacting us, families of recently deceased people, who are concerned about Roselawn.There is a perception within the Catholic, nationalist, republican community that Roselawn is not a welcome place for them. It#s our job to address that. We have even spoken to staff members working at Roselawn who are trying to get more information from the council and who are worried about going into their jobs on a daily basis, Councillor McLaughlin said.However, the two east Belfast Ulster Unionist councillors rejected Councillor McLaughlin#s remarks, saying the Roselawn facility is open to all sections of the community - and always has been.Thousands of people have been buried as well as cremated in Roselawn since it opened in the early sixties.

It became John#s anthem and certainly any time we were in company and I was asked to play the piano, I could be sure that within seconds Hume would be at my shoulder saying #do the Town#.Mr Coulter acknowledged his friend#s singing capabilities, which he said were like every one  in Derry.He added: John could sing and like everybody in Derry, he believed God gave him the right to sing.

At his father’s funeral yesterday, a message was read out on behalf of Aidan Hume in which he said the university campaign served as a catalyst for his father’s career in politics. In , the Lockwood report recommended that Northern Irelands second university be sited in Coleraine rather than Derry. It was viewed as a controversial decision at the time and highly contested in the city. That same year a cross-community campaign was led by John Hume, the unionist mayor Albert Anderson and Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party. googletag.cmd.push At yesterday’s funeral a message was delivered by Hume’s daughter, Mo, on behalf of her brother Aidan who couldn’t travel from the United States due to the coronavirus pandemic. In it, Aidan said that using a moral compass as his only tether his father’s ‘perseverance and sheer will’ brought ‘hope and history’ together. “It began with the corrupt siting of the university, driven by a total lack of respect for ersity,’ he added. The university campaign acted as a prelude to the civil rights movement and was part of a building of frustrations felt by Derry people. Ultimately the protest had no impact on the final decision but it may have saved Magee campus, which had been earmarked for closure. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann, civil rights veteran and former neighbour of Hume, believes it was the university campaign that set the tone for the former SDLP leader’s style of politics in the decades to come. At this stage people will be familiar with the motorcade to Stormont in protest over Lockwoods decision, he added. But he says, as signicant, was a Guildhall Square rally ‘jammed with people’ where a youthful John Hume spoke not of ‘unionist discrimination’ but of the need for ‘togetherness’ to bring about reform. “There really you have the microcosm of his politics and strategy for the rest of his le, it was all there.” In  a Peace and Conflict Studies course was formed at the Magee campus in Derry, an internationally renowned programme offered by leading academics from the International Conflict Research Institute . In recognition of Hume’s peace-building efforts, Ulster University announced funding for the John Hume and Thomas P. ONeill Chair in Peace, to be established at the Magee campus. Set up in honour of both politicians, the Chair is a full-time academic position in peace and conflict resolution studies which helps to train the next generation of peacemakers from around the world. Presidents and leaders from around the world, including Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama, spoke to audiences at the campus. However, there was widespread concern in Derry when a decision was made to relocate the course to Belfast a number of years ago. ‘JOHN’S VISION’ Current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that throughout his le, John Hume stood up for Derry and all its people. “He understood the transformative impact of education and knew all too well the structural inequalities forced upon the people of this city,” he said. “John campaigned for university provision in Derry that could deliver the skills and opportunities our people need to grow and prosper, even against the backdrop of a campaign of violence that plagued the lives of those in the city. “Delivering on John’s vision for Derry is a priority for me and for the SDLP. I am committed to ensuring that everyone in this city has the opportunity to make a live for themselves here. “Johns lasting legacy should be that we never allow our young people to be raised for export. Derry needs a full-scale university, nothing  will meet the needs of our people.” Meanwhile, the Derry University Groupwhich has been lobbying for an independent university in the city described John Hume as one of the greatest educators and thinkers the city has known since Colmcille. GarbhaacutenDowney of the DUG said: “He taught us of the importance of a university as a centre of learning, industry, science and arts, heritage, philosophy and discourse as the focal point for community engagement, and the lead agent for positive change and self-empowerment “He worked throughout his career to establish a university here to serve as the bedrock for the new, peaceful society of equals, which he had envisaged for Derry from his earliest days as a social champion. “The campaign to build a university, begun by John Hume sixty years ago, is still unfinished. It has been described as the last remaining civil rights issue. “There could be no more fitting legacy to John Hume than for his home city to finish this job now.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s unlikely Ballyronan had ever seen anything like it. Tickets for the event cost pound. and, even allowing for inflation, represented real value for the sheer quality of the acts on show. Rory Gallagher was the headline act in the festival’s second year, and would ultimately prove to be the last, as it never ed to the Loughshore. While shortlived, the festival boasted a stellar line up, with a host of rock talent making their way to the south Derry village. googletag.cmd.push The hugely talented Pat McManus remembers the gig well. Among them was Pat McManus, lead guitarist and fiddle player in Mama’s Boys, who were second on the bill behind Gallagher on that late July evening  years ago. “We were heading off on a European tour and it was seen as a good warm-up gig for us to do as well. It was a good festival gig to get us into tip-top shape,” he told the County Derry Post. “We had an album out - Growing Up the Hard Way – and we would have been there to promote it. They must have thought they’d have the two Irish bands to headline – Rory and ourselves. googletag.cmd.push “Plus, to be on the same bill as Rory Gallagher was fantastic, we always jumped at the chance to share the stage with Rory. “He was one of my heroes growing up, and still is. He was marvellous. From that point of view, it was great. “We’d shared the stage a couple of times with Rory in Germany and ious places like that, but this was the first time on home soil, which we were delighted about.”  While McManus, a native of Derrylin in County Fermanagh, was unfamiliar with Ballyronan, Mama’s Boys did have a link to the maiden festival of . “Magnum was the headline act the year before and Mark Stanway, their keyboard player, has been in my solo band quite a few times,” he said. “This kind of festival wasn’t too popular in Ireland, but in Germany and other places we toured, you would get lots of little villages putting on festivals. “The attendance could be anywhere from , to , people, it just depends. It was a brave thing to do. It wasn’t going to be Dalymount or Macroom that Rory had done in the past. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play. “Rory was an international rock star, so to see him on your own soil, so close to Lough Neagh was an incredible thing. You wouldn’t have seen much of Rory playing that kind of festival.” While the presence of the Ballyshannon-born Gallagher was undoubtedly the festival’s main draw, a host of other stars were strewn throughout the supporting acts. Don Airey of Deep Purple shared the stage with Mamas Boys in . Deep Purple’s Don Airey, who also played with Whitesnake, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne, guested with Mama’s Boys, themselves an internationally supported band. Magnum’s Mark Stanley was also involved with the legendary Phil Lynott’s Grand Slam, while there was also a surprise appearance from one of Northern Ireland’s finest rock musicians. “The legendary Vivian Campbell, who now plays with Def Leppard, made a guest appearance with his old band, Sweet Savage, so that added more excitement on the day,” said McManus. “It was a wonderful afternoon’s music. People were rather spoiled. His pedigree as a musician from Northern Ireland was second to none. Everybody was very excited to see Vivian there.” The eclectic nature of the festival’s line up saw rock fans from across the country converging on the shores of Lough Neagh. Larne native Gerry McNally, current sub-editor of the Folk and Tumble website, had travelled down from the east coast for Rory’s gig, having also been in attendance the previous year. “I can remember crossing a couple of fields and it was right beside the Lough,” he said. “It was a beautul venue too, right on the shores of Lough Neagh and both years they had fireworks at the end of each night. The line ups were good both years too. “You were luckysomeone came to the Ulster Hall or the King’s Hall. Gigs would have been quite rare back then, you were mostly going to Dublin for them. Gerry McNallys ticket stub for the pound. gig. “I was only getting into Rory’s music, but I’d never seen or heard anything like it. He was still in good health back then and was just a ball of energy. “Sadly, that was the one and only time I saw him. Looking back, I wish I was as familiar with his music then as I am now. I would have appreciated it a lot more. “At the time, I’d never seen anything like it. I was living in the moment, taking it in and just being awestruck. His playing was amazing. “The only other band I really remember were Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts. They didn’t take themselves too seriously, but they were a good, fun band.” Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts may not have been Gerry’s go-to, but for young fan Darren Seaton, they were the main draw. “Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts was the other band I was specically there for,” said the Belfast native, who was  at the time. “You’d always see them listed in Kerrang, they were really good, but we were there all day. You got dropped off in the morning and you get picked up afterwards. Young rock fan Darren Seaton made the trip from Belfast for a glimpse at Dumpys Rusty Nuts. “Our trip was run by Makin’ Tracks in Belfast, they used to be the main record store. You would have got your gig tickets and bus tickets and then met at Glengall Street for the bus. “The day we were there, there was also a band from New Zealand that nobody had ever heard of. I’ve no idea how they got on the bill, but they were touring round Europe. “They had a video camera with them and were basically filming us all telling them to f**k off. “Rory, obviously, was legendary. I didn’t really know a lot about him, because being , I was more into Bon Jovi and stuff at the time,” he said. “I hadn’t realised the epicness of what was in front of me and the fact I wouldn’t get to see him live again.” Despite the profanity towards the unwitting visitors from the southern hemisphere, Darren and his friends managed to make their way to the backstage area. “There was a band playing called DARE, whose frontman, Darren Wharton, played keyboard with Thin Lizzy,” he said. Darren Wharton, formerly of Thin Lizzy, fronted DARE at the Rock at the Lough festival. “We were talking to their merch guy, who had a table behind a wire fence. He was on one side in the ‘backstage’ area and we were on the other, passing money through the fence for t-shirts. “He gave us his pass and told us to go into the dining hall, so me and a couple of mates went down and had dinner with the drummer and the bass player there!” Musicians coming to play in Northern Ireland had become a rare breed throughout the Troubles, with many acts choosing to avoid coming to Belfast in particular. Despite its idyllic setting on the Loughshore, the Ballyronan festival was not immune to the threat of violence. “We got down the road to Ballyronan to be told we couldn’t get in yet, because there was a bomb scare and a Chinook flying overhead,” recalled Darren. “It was a hoax, but we were sitting on the bus for about two hours outside Ballyronan until they cleared it and we were all allowed in.” News of the bomb scare also filtered through to the bands, all of whom had shown a steely determination to perform. “I remember something about that, but it obviously was a prank, because no one passed any remarks,” said Pat McManus. “And evenit was, we were going to go ahead and play anyway because people had paid in there and wanted to see the bands. “They [the police] were probably wondering what the hell was going on with all the people gathering – it might have been that more than anything . “We were determined, come hell or high water, we were going to get on that stage and play and the rest of the artists that day felt the same.” Local rock star Vivian Campbell made a surprise appearance at the festival. Despite a hugely ambitious line-up, the festival only lasted for two years. Although a beautul venue, a lack of marketing and issues with accessibility undermined its success. “I’d say there was somewhere in the region of , people there,” said Pat McManus. “People didn’t know about it either and others were a bit sceptical, but from looking out from where I was on the stage, that’s the amount I would have guessed. “It was a brave undertaking for those guys to put on the show and get the bands to play. The people were fortunate to get to see those acts play.” One of the fortunate, Darren Seaton, sums it up well. “It’s strange that a random place like Ballyronan had these two big festivals two years in a row. It was a great day out.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats all they needed. Twelve months after surrendering the league title on the final day, Limavady were untouchable at the top of the table. A - victory at Ards saw Graeme Eastwoods side with one hand and the four fingers of the other on the trophy. With  wins from as many games, as well as  bonus points earned, Limavady accumulated  points out of a possible . The clubs seconds were second in the league and had a Forster Plate semi-final to look forward to. The first team had five of their six remaining league games at home, where they were unbeaten during Eastwoods tenure. Just shy of their meeting with second placed Ballymoney, Covid- dragged the sporting landscape to a halt and with the finish line in sight, their season of effort was gone. googletag.cmd.push “We tried not to speak about it too much,” Head Coach Graeme Eastwood told the County Derry Post, with a tone engulfed by acceptance. His focus is on the now. After an extended break, Limavady gathered in recent weeks to pick up the pieces and plan for next season. “The boys took up where they left off, had a super attitude and we didnt lose too many players,” Eastwood continued. Scrum-half Jamie Millar transferred to City of Derry in search of first XV rugby and hooker Luke Montgomery found travelling up and down to Belfast for training and games not sustainable. Both are from Limavady and the door will always be open. googletag.cmd.push “We cant hold them back from playing rugby somewhere , we wished them well and they will be back at some stage,” Eastwood said. Last season wasnt the only time Limavady were pipped at the finish line. In Eastwoods first season,  , they topped the table by a point before losing the title with a defeat in the final game.  Coaches with some of Limavady’s new signings  “From a coaching point of view, the improvement is important. We hardly won a game up until Christmas, the year before I came in, and the following year itshows how much work the boys are putting in. “To go unbeaten last season, it shows the boys have been putting the invaluable work in on the training pitch. There were a few of them flirting with retirement, but every one of them is chomping at the bit.” Eastwood believes the club is in a strong place, both on and off the pitch. An acquired grant helped kit out the clubs gym and they now have access to three grass pitches, as well as the G facility at Scroggy Road. “As a club in the North West,you look at how Coleraine reacted last year, we were above Ballymoney and City of Derry were at the bottom ofC,” he points out. “We would like to think we are well up there and are attracting players from Coleraine, Ballymoney and Derry, who want to come to us to play an attractive brand of rugby and to a club on the up. “We have a few boys around  and , but the average age is in around ,  and . That team could stay together,they want, for the next four or five years and try and be successful. “As a club, we want to go upand we want to challenge again at the top end of junior rugby. Whatever way it has happened, we have not been able to do that. Hopefully this season we can try and recty it,” Eastwood hopes. One of those flirting with the idea of retirement was Jody McMurray, who doubles up as assistant coach after moving to the club with Eastwood. “Heruns the backs and this is probably his last year donning the boots, so he wants to go out with a bit of a bang,” Graeme reveals. Peter Wilson mixes playing with his duties as the skills coach, with Oisin Quinn now going into his second season in charge of the teams Strength and Conditioning. “He has worked wonders,” Graeme endorses. “He is very good with the injury prevention stuff, touch wood last season we had a broken bone here and there, but we didnt have one muscle strain and his inclusion is invaluable to us. He had the boys in tip top form. “For someone new to the rugby setup, he has really put his hand up to what we are trying to do over the last  to  months,” he said of Quinn, who has worked with Derry GAA teams and owns his own gym. “He has been a great addition to our coaching team and we are grateful he is staying for another season.” On the field, Limavady have had a productive off-season, with  players joining the , against only Jamie Millar and Luke Montgomerys departures. In particular, there has been an improved link with the local Limavady Grammar School. “We have got a really good connection and we are trying to build that link. Like every sport, having that link between schools and the youth setup is very important. Teams cant survive with bringing in playersevery year,” Eastwood added. He has high hopes for Ben McMillan, who has came in as hooker from the school, prop John McMichael s from the Academy and another from the Grammar School, Joe McCartney, younger brother of full-back Jim. “We have a really good mix,” Eastwood continued. “On top of that, we have brought in Craig Hueywho brings over  years of AIL senior experience, Jack Beattie a winger from Derry who played at Ulster youth level has also joined. “We have kept Jody McMurray, who has over  years experience, and Stuart Morrow who is an ex-club international.” Eastwood feels his side punches above their weight and with the disappointing end to the season, there will be a renewed vigour to finish the job this time. “All we can do is prepare as best we can and hopefully everything unfolds in front of us”, he said, referring to the complications of preparing a team with the cloud of a second Covid spike a possibility. “We know it is going to be dficult, other teams will be playing catchup and will have done their best over the summer to make sure they are strong as possible “I always day  we keep our own house in order and worry about how we train and play, then we will never be too far away,” Eastwood added. He feels the club would hold their own in Division , should they advance at the end of the season when it begins. “If you look at where theyhave come from, six years ago they were in Division  and not knowing where they were going. “Now you have ex internationals and boys leaving AIL clubs to come to Limavady because of what we are trying to do down here, it is exciting times,” Eastwood states. Its all with the sobering thought of needing to deliver. He uses the statement - nobody remembers anybody that doesnt win anything – to remind himself of what is at stake. “We are unfortunate, in that we couldve had two league titles in two years. We got beat in the semi-final of a junior cup, we won the conference Division , one the club has never won. “We want the big one. If you are top of the tree after  games, you are the best team that season and hopefully we can go a bit further this year and try and win it.” Thats the focus. It is that simple. Eastwood has organised games with AIL side Ballymena and Ulster Division  side Cooke for September. “They are two good tests, so we can be where we want to be at for our first league game. It will give us a few weeks to fix anything we see is needing addressed,” Eastwood concludes. The new season is about unfinished business.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She said: “I am delighted that the minister has written to me to confirm that this was an error, and that the department understand it is a persons right to have their name printed in Irish. “Where their council has a street sign policy in place which has legally adopted their street or road into Irish, they are entitled to have their address displayed as such.” Ms Sheerin also confirmed the constituents had now received their licenses with their names printed in Irish.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A delivery van was hijacked at Rathlin Drive in the estate on Tuesday afternoon before being set on fire. It was one of three vehicles hijacked in Derry on Tuesday. Local politicians condemned the hijackings and said they had destroyed the livelihoods of the workers involved. Community workers today said there were widespread concerns about the attacks in Creggan this week. In a joint statement, Conal McFeely, Tony O’Doherty, Shauna Deery and Gerry Quinn of Creggan Neighbourhood Partnershipsaid there were also concerns about police activity in Creggan which included, they said, house raids, stop and search tactics and other disruption activity by the TSG   TIU . googletag.cmd.push “We, as the community, need to listen and to speak out, to ensure that everyone fully understands the negative consequences of such events and the social, economic and reputational damage to iniduals, families and the wider community,” the statement said. “Creggan has been fully compliant to public health guidance, and extremely resilient and considerate during the Covid lockdown – an exemplar in how a community should respond to a crisis. “According to current statistics, this area has among the lowest reported crime figures in the city and, contrary to the widely-reported, albeit ill-informed, perception, Creggan is in fact a very safe and caring community. googletag.cmd.push “The last number of weeks, however, have seen a number of serious incidents which we believe require further investigation. “CNP believe there is an underlying context to this week’s disturbances, which has gone largely unreported and hence has, again, led to a very one-sided picture of this area being portrayed.” The community workers said young people and families had told them that they are being deliberately targeted by highly aggressive, frightening and quasi-legal policing procedures tactics. “And it is incumbent on us, as a socially-just community, to take account of all available evidence, to establish a full and fair perspective of the situation. “CNP in no way condone or excuse the activities leading to the physical, mental and reputational damage done by, or to, any person or property in this community. “We are aware, however, that there is a specic context to recent events – this response did not happen out of nowhere. “And we also believe that there is a responsibility on all of us to examine that context and engage with young people and local residents – both to listen to their concerns and to ensure that they understand the extremely negative consequences of the destruction of community or private property, and the knock-on affects in relation to the traumatic impacts on affected iniduals and the denial of public services to the area. “There is a growing concern about the ‘cause and effect’ nature of ongoing police activity in the area and recent community disturbances. “Many within this community believe that current police actions only serve to undermine public confidence in policing and indeed the independence and effectiveness of the local and regional police oversight bodies which are supposed to hold police to account. “Our public representatives and church leaders should be concerned, and not be afraid to speak out, about how our area is being policed and is being impacted by the resulting destruction of community or private property.” The Creggan community workers said that following a process of mediation with relevant groupings, it has been established that there is no impediment to the resumption of all delivery and maintenance services in the area. “Tensions are high in the area at the moment – there is a great deal of hurt and frustration which needs to be acknowledged and the specic reasons for these sentiments need to be explored. “CNP believe there is a critical need for an independent review of the recent disturbances – and their context – and will engage inclusively with the entire community to ensure that any such process will be as fair and transparent as possible.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Regularly setting top  times throughout the event, the -year-old and co-driver Keaton Williams soon got to grips with the unique Italian roads, to complete their first event since March’s Covid- lockdown halted all rallying in Ireland and the UK. The duo also upheld Irish honours at the event, with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entering two drivers on the event which saw no less than  Hyundai i R’s tackle the event, joining World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville in their i Coupe WRC’s. googletag.cmd.push Like most aspiring young rally drivers, McErlean’s season was decimated by the Covid- outbreak and had his  plans quashed by the cancellation of the British Rally Championship earlier in the year. After a tricky opening round of the BRC in Wales in which the  Junior BRC champion impressed onlookers with a string of top five times, he was eager toto the stages and thanks to the help of the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing, a deal was done to head to Italy for Rally di Alba. Although McErlean, the current Billy Coleman Award winner, had technically competed in Italy before, at the Monza Rally Show, the event would mark his first closed road event in the Hyundai outside of Ireland and with over  kilometers of special stages ahead, McErlean would need to focus all his energy on theto competitive action. googletag.cmd.push A loop of three stages would be repeated three times and whilst becoming more familiar with the stages would inevitably assist McErlean, the loose gravel and rocks pulled onto the stages with each pass offered an additional hazard, especially towards the closing stages of the rally.After a positive pre-event Shakedown on Saturday, McErlean was eager to settle into a comfortable rhythm on the stages in his Michelin shod Hyundai and opened his account with an impressive thoverall stage time on the first test of the event with many experienced Italian crews behind. His form continued throughout the opening loop to land thoverall after three stages. Fourteenth fastest on the fourth counter was a highlight and an indication of just how well McErlean was bedding into the Italian roads, climbing one place to thin the process. Sadly, a technical issue on the fth stage meant he and Williams would have to carry out roadside repairs to the i R before heading into the sixth test. Those repairs would eat into his road section time, handing him an unfortunate -second penalty before he was able to attempt the stage. Luckily McErlean was able to nurse the i back to service where the Philip Case Rallysport team worked against the clock to get the Hyundai back to full health. A mature drive over the final three stages saw McErlean further cement his position toto Alba with an impressive top twenty result. “I’m delighted to have reached the finish today and although it wasn’t entirely trouble-free, I really enjoyed the experience, it was a real honour to compete on such a fantastic occasion and with an amazing atmosphere,”said McErlean. “We came here with a clear goal to get experience and build the pace throughout the rally and I feel we did just that. Analysing the times and considering the lack of experience in Italy it was very much mission accomplished throughout the weekend and without the time penalty, the result would have been as good as I could wish for. I’m happy with the way both Keaton and I managed the situation we found ourselves in and got the job done on the way to the sixth test to enable us to carry on. Resilience and thinking on your feet are a key focus of the Motorsport Rally Academy so we were very able to put that into practice. The pace this weekend shows that I`m heading very much in the right direction and I am eager to make more plans to take that forward during the remainder of the season. I’d like to thank all our backers, Sean McHugh and John Coyne from the MI Rally Academy, Andrew Johns from Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing and Tim Hoare from Michelin for all their invaluable support once again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours.

to a genuinely great political leader, he said.ldquoA few years ago during a visit with the late Maurice Hayes at his home in Downpatrick a chat about developing GAA facilities was taken on a brilliant rambling tangent re John Hume.Maurice knew him well, and opened a door to the man Irsquod only known through my studies at that point. It was laden with humour and humility ndash but also plenty of lessons for us all today.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath spoke of the respect he had for Mr Humersquos commitment to ldquopeace and peaceful non-violent dialogue.He said: ldquoIn all his days, no matter how often he was attacked, John never once turned to violence and lived those very ideals of peaceful nonviolent resistance. He showed us that it was possible. He showed us that peace was achievable. We believed him, because of how radically he believed in those ideals and lived them.Mr McGrath said that through his work, Mr Hume offered ldquoyoung and old alike a vision of a future in which the gun would be removed from Irish politics, no matter how hard terrorists would and continue to resist this.Council chairperson Laura Devlin, praised Mr Hume as ldquoa man of peace and a ldquotrue hero who left a ldquolasting legacy as one of the highest profile politicians on the island of Ireland who was highly respected by all communities.Addressing the councilrsquos full virtual monthly meeting on Monday, she asked: ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to the contribution this man has made to the landscape of Ireland ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to this man who stood beside his community through Northern Irelandrsquos most terrying and dark days and walked proudly beside them as we ushered in together the days of peace Cllr Devlin added that from his example, she entered politics to ldquorepresent the needs of the community and added: ldquoIn all of his years, in all his roles, whether as an MLA, an MP, an MEP, a teacher, a family man, a friendhelliphis people came first.Respect was shown to Mr Hume and condolences to his family came from right across the political ide in the council chamber.Councillor Billy Walker, on behalf of the DUP council group, paid his respects to Mr Humersquos family and to the wider SDLP group.He said the death was a ldquosad loss to politics and paid tribute to Mr Humersquos determination to peace-making and ldquoremoving the gun out of politics in Northern Ireland, even sometimes when his own party did not support him during the Hume-Adams talks.He added: ldquoI also had the greatest admiration and respect of how the three then MEPs, John Hume, Ian Paisley and John Taylor, despite their political dferences, worked together to bring millions of European money into Northern Ireland for the benefit of us all.Alliance councillor Andrew McMurray said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot without the hard work and sacrice of people like John Hume, we wouldnrsquot live in the Northern Ireland we do today.ldquoHis enormous contribution to the peace process, the end of violence and the determination to deliver a society built on peace and equality for everyone which be his lasting legacy along with a le well-lived.ldquoAs a young man growing up it was very obvious to me that John Hume was not only a man who stood for things but stood against things.Councillor Pete Byrne, leader of the SDLP council group, thanked his council colleagues for their kind words and said that the level of international tributes being made about Mr Hume reflected the ldquohigh level of esteem he was held in.ldquoItrsquos very hard to overstate the importance of John Hume to this island, he said. ldquoThrough the most dficult times, John fought for justice, equality and peace.ldquoHe taught me to have respect for dference and ersity and I think thatrsquos a message thatrsquos really important today.ldquoI want to thank John for delivering the institutions that we have today, they may not be perfect, but it brought peace to our streets and I want to thank John for leaving the blueprint for us all to build upon.SDLP councillor Dermot Curran called his former party leader as being ldquoa man of the people, for the people in his tribute.He said: ldquoAlong with the late Eddie McGrady, we worked with John a lot over the years, particularly when he was an MEP in Europe over fishing interests.ldquoI always remember he would tell me that he never sought to be a leader, only to help people. That stuck with me and it was something that I carried with me in my work.ldquoHis unstinting work for peace and what he did for us all cannot be understated.Due to Covid- restrictions, the Book of Condolence is now available online at https:www.newrymournedown.org chairpersons-book-of-condolences until Monday, August .All messages in the online book will be recorded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and sent directly to Mr Humersquos family..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Saintfield Horse Show success  ","story":"THIS yearrsquos Saintfield Horse Show on Saturday at Eugene Milliganrsquos ldquomagnicent venue in Castlewellan was hailed as one of the best shows and attracted a large number of entries mdash despite the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.Competitors came from all over the island and were delighted with the huge, flat rings and the well laid out ground.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoThere was sun, fun and something for everyone who attended.

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place.

Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

and could bring  jobs to the town, a local councillor has said.By The NewsroomFriday, th August , : pmUpdated Friday, th August , : pm\"\"The application, lodged by applicant Inaltus Ltd on behalf of Curly Properties Ltd is for a retail development with car parking, landscaping, access and associated site works developed atvacant lands north of Millennium Way, Lurgan.Originally submitted in  the planning proposal has been recommended for approval by Council’s planning officers and will,approved, see Home Bargains arrive in town.Speaking in support of the application, Councillor Joe Nelson said it would bring “signicant economic benefits… including some  new jobs” to Lurgan.“I believe the site location is ideal for this development as it provides adequate car parking in situ and is located on Millenium Way which is in fact the relief road for Lurgan Town Centre,” say the SDLP councillor.“Bringing this development to the town while keeping the town centre free from extra congestion is the ideal position.“I strongly support these proposals and trust that the material considerations, associated with the economic and other benefits of the scheme, will be considered in detail by the Council planners.”Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley has expressed “strong support” for the application.“The proposals will see the delivery of a Home Bargains store for Lurgan along with signicant economic benefits including a multi-million pound investment into the local economy and the creation of some  new jobs,” said the DUP MLA“At a time when many people are losing their jobs and many businesses are having to close, proposal such as this, where successful major retailingbusinesses are willing to commit to Lurgan, the Council must give very serious consideration to these proposals.”However, an independentreview of the application by Tom Stokes Associated Planning expressed concerns that rather than support the town centre, the application,approved, is “more likely to create an alternative retail destination to the town centre”.The report said that with  per cent of the Lurgan town centre’s turnover allocated to just two stores, the remaining smaller conveniencestores in Lurgan could be “vulnerable to impact” by the approval of this application.The review also suggested that the proposal would be better suited to the former Tesco site in Castle Lane as it is “a key regeneration site in the town centre”.However, in response to this, the application’s agent, Inaltus Ltd, said: “If this site did not suit Tesco’s servicing requirements, there are no grounds for TSA to suggest it will suit Home Bargains.”In conclusion Inaltus Ltd’s response to TSA assessmentstates that whilst some aspects of the TSA Review can be agreed “other aspects are illogical and do not form a sound basis to refuse the proposal on”.It also notes that no objections have been lodged in over  months and called for the application to be brought before Council’s planning committee.The application is now set to appear before Wednesday’smeeting of the planning committee, with officer’s recommending that the application is approved.-------A message from the
