The deepest level of the quarry hotel is nearly 700 metres (2,297 feet) lower than the top floor of the world\u0027s highest-hotel-to-be, the J Hotel, under construction in Shanghai Tower (right)Because there is a pond at the bottom of the quarry, the air outside the bottom of the hotel is cooled by the water. Therefore, architects have made it possible for the cooler air to be drawn into the building at the deeper floors. As the air is warmed up by people and equipment inside the building, it will get warmer and then rise through the building to vent out at the top floor above the ground, creating a natural air circulation.On the other hand, some of the rock face is exposed in the interior of the building, providing an ideal thermal mass to help regulate the building\u0027s temperature.The InterContinental Hotels Group is yet to release any pictures of InterContinental Shanghai Wonderland.However, guests can now book for stays at the hotel from November 15 and onwards on Chinese travel site Alitrip.

Critics can\u0027t help but notice that Robin Wright\u0027s stellar solo-lead performance (right) still can\u0027t help the show from escaping the dank shadow of Kevin SpaceyAt the moment, the sixth season has scored 81 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes and has average rating of just 63.7 per cent. The general consensus amongst viewers is that the show spends too much time addressing what happened to Frank and the ramifications of his absence. IndieWire said that the focus on Frank fallout \u0027undercuts\u0027 the numerous \u0027women-first stories,\u0027 causing the season to appear \u0027stagnant.\u0027The sentiment was shared by Variety who stated that Frank\u0027s absence left the season \u0027scrambling\u0027 when it came to to a plot. But almost all viewers have been praising the additions of Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear - who play a menacing brother-sister combo who run a conglomerate and are determined to force Claire\u0027s hand repeatedly. Other stellar performances are also consistently referenced, including Patricia Clarkson.Before you binge watch House of Cards\u0027 sixth season, here is what you need to know!House of Cards reviews IndieWire  \u0027More than half the final season passes before “House of Cards” feels like Claire Underwood’s (Robin Wright) story instead of his epilogue, and even when she starts to see her vision borne out, the lingering questions are all about Frank,\u0027 the review stated. \u0027Despite the hype, Season 6 isn’t Claire’s show. It’s still Frank’s, which undercuts the season’s many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant.\u0027 They added that the show started to feel a lot like a \u0027murder-mystery\u0027 - but not exactly in a good way.  \u0027Seeing it this way provides a bit of goofy levity to a series always toeing the line between pompous prestige and soapy melodrama, even if the story’s morbid obsession with how Frank died sparks bad memories of “This Is Us,” Jack Pearson, and a slow-cooker. The review did praise the performance of Patricia Clarkson as Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade Jane Davis.           The cast at the season six premiere on October 22 It said: \u0027 After joining the cast in Season 5, the Oscar nominee  operates on another level than the rest of the cast — another show, even.\u0027About the show\u0027s shortcomings, Indiewire said: \u0027When Claire addressed the camera and said, “My turn” and all but erased her camera-whore hubby from control, there was no reason the audience should believe otherwise. \u0027Instead, five of the eight final episodes over-emphasize his importance and fail to create arcs worthy of Wright’s talents or Claire’s iniduality. Worse yet, they weaken the show’s conscious effort to highlight the discrimination facing female politicians.\u0027  IndieWire gave the season a C Plus grade.Entertainment Weekly  Entertainment Weekly rated the season much higher, at a B Plus, and praised the direction the series went with women in politics.  \u0027In its final season, House of Cards wants to imagine a scenario where women are the ones who rule the world — but instead of making it a better place, they are as cutthroat, venal, and wholly nihilistic as the legions of men who have come before,\u0027 they said.EW also relished in the opportunities \u0027actresses in their midlife prime\u0027 had at commanding their scenes throughout the show.  Their highest praise was saved for Wright, where they said: (about Claire) The final season of House of Cards belongs to her, and more importantly, Wright herself. \u0027Sporting perfectly-tailored, military-style suits and dresses, her sleek blonde bob shielding her head like a helmet, Wright brings more humor to Claire than ever before as the President exploits sexist stereotypes about female hysteria\u0027As the sly nods to Lysistrata and Sylvia Plath’s Lady Lazarus attest, behind President Underwood’s feminist facade is a warrior set on nothing less than complete patriarchal destruction.\u0027 NPRNPR seemed the most pessimistic about the direction that the show went in its sixth season, claiming that the first five episodes \u0027reveal just how tiresome the show\u0027s machinations have become.\u0027They were quick to praise the performance of the supporting cast in the absence of Casey.\u0027The performances here are wonderful, especially Kinnear as controlling power broker Bill Shepherd and Lane as Annette Shepherd — whose rivalry with Claire is tangible and toxic,\u0027 the review stated.

Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear (right) play a menacing brother-sister combo who run a conglomerate and are determined to force Claire\u0027s hand repeatedlyThe AtlanticThe Atlantic also praised performances while blasting the plot. They said: \u0027Cards has always been a show whose plot contortions could confuse and whose incremental intrigue could bore, and those problems are worse now that everyone seems to be whispering.\u0027In their review, the Atlantic criticized the slow movement in which the show finally gets around to giving Claire her time to shine. And even when she does, it\u0027s often at the detriment to real world implications.Unfortunately, it isn’t until more than halfway through the eight-episode season that Claire’s big plan becomes clear. When it does, it involves Wright making a hammy, malevolent parody of gendered expectations, brilliantly puncturing the gunmetal patina that’s fallen upon the show and helping bury the memory of Frank’s excesses. The plot surely must hurl toward doom, but a deeper tragedy is suggested: if only this woman never had to hide her true self.

Of the three groups, vegetarians experienced the most negative feelings and enjoyed social occasions least.Lead author Dr John Nezlek, from the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poznan, Poland, said: ‘Sometimes unwittingly, and sometimes intentionally, vegetarians may be excluded from social events or made to feel odd or different because they are vegetarians.

Tuno will be available in cans, and in pouches in flavours ranging from sweet chilli to sesame ginger.Eric Woods, managing director of Worldwide Food Associates, which is distributing the product, said it was ‘a tasty, healthy and convenient option’ which would transform the meat-free food market.Similar questions – asking how well their day had gone and how optimistic they were about the future – were used to assess depressive tendencies.Vegetarians scored 4.62 for self-respect and meat-eaters 5.33, where a lower score was worse. They were also more likely to be depressed and unsatisfied with their life, the study found.The authors, also from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, suggested vegetarians may suffer because they are seen by meat-eaters as morally superior.They added: ‘Given that many celebrities advocate some type of vegetarian diet, non-vegetarians may feel that vegetarians are “putting on airs” and that they are “too good” for non-vegetarians.’Twenty-four vegetarians, including some vegans, took part in the study. They were compared with 323 omnivores and 56 ‘semi-vegetarians’, some of whom ate fish or only avoided red meat.When asked whether they felt they led a purposeful existence, vegetarians saw less meaning in life than the other groups, according to researchers. They were also more likely to experience stress and embarrassment.However, a spokesman for the Vegetarian Society disputed the findings, saying: ‘What we see when people adopt a veggie diet in line with their values is they feel excited and positive about the contribution they are making.’The study appears in the journal Ecology of Food and Nutrition.

Devastatingly, at six weeks she miscarried. A third attempt also resulted in a pregnancy, but it was ectopic. ‘It was terrible knowing I was pregnant but the baby wouldn’t survive as it moved into the fallopian tube,’ Mrs Neal said.A fourth attempt also resulted in another ectopic pregnancy, and a fifth attempt proved negative.Mrs Neal said: ‘That was due to be our final go.

Their first attempt there resulted in a positive test, but once again Mrs Neal had a miscarriage.In July 2016, they tried again in Prague, but she experienced an ‘incredibly rare and dangerous’ type of ectopic pregnancy and had to have the embryo removed. Six months later, an eighth attempt proved negative.The clinic had some frozen embryos left from the Neals’ previous attempts and offered them a final IVF round for free – but it was still a difficult decision.

But then it can’t be easy when you are sharing a Buckingham Palace balcony with a sister-in-law like Meghan, who is hot off the Hollywood red carpet.While no ordinary woman can reasonably be expected to regain her pre-baby body for the third time so quickly, the burning question is how does Kate manage to look so great?GLAMOROUS GLADRAGSFollowing the birth in April of Prince Louis, Kate has only started performing public engagements over the past month.And it seems her five months maternity leave has given her time to think about an image revamp — as well as to study the form of her stylish sister-in-law.While Meghan may have got through an incredible 41 outfit changes during her first official foreign tour to Australia, at home Kate’s making sure her own outfits are just as eye-catching.She brought a touch of Hollywood glamour to a state dinner at Buckingham Palace last week when she wore a steel blue ruched Alexander McQueen ball-gown, her most daring to date.So could some of Meghan’s style be starting to rub off on her sister-in-law?The pair are certainly starting to share more designer labels.They are both fans of the Canadian brand Smythe, and this week Kate wore their new season £625 blazer for her visit to Coach Core in Essex, teaming it with pair of on-trend Aquatalia ankle boots and a roll-neck jumper.Since Meghan joined the Royal Family, Kate has also opted for more youthful, less matronly styles, such as the cap-sleeved, bright yellow, form-fitting Dolce and Gabbana dress she wore to Wimbledon — which could just as easily have been found in Meghan’s wardrobe.KINDEST CUT The first signs that Kate was back with a new image was her shorter hair cut.Celebrity hair stylist Jason Collier says: ‘Her hair looks a few inches shorter than when we last saw her, with some layers and lighter highlights added in for extra bounce and shine.‘Kate looks to have lightened her shade overall to give a sun-kissed effect. This is a great way to disguise any first greys her hair is naturally so dark that any grey strands would show up more noticeably, so the lightened locks are a clever move.‘The colour also lifts her skin tone, so overall it looks very fresh.‘Of course, Kate gave birth to her third child this year and is likely still to be experiencing the effects of post-partum hair loss, but her hair looks very thick and shiny.’  Look sophisticated like Kate in a pencil dress by Jenny PackhamShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Cambridge made another appearance this week and we\u0026#39re certainly  making the most of it for fashion inspiration.Whilst she went smart casual for her Coach Core visit, she opted for a more sophisticated look when paying a trip to the Imperial War Museum. Back to her best in blue, Kate wore a pencil dress by one of her go-to designers, Jenny Packham. You might remember it from her trip to Canada back in 2016? The little puff shoulders are a feature we\u0026#39ve seen in several of her bespoke outfits recently, plus those flared sleeves are a nice touch. The colour is somewhere in between navy and royal blue, and when teamed with a nude Mulberry clutch bag and Gianvito Rossi court heels, it\u0026#39s classic Kate.

Indeed, Kate has always viewed exercise as a non-negotiable part of her daily regime.Her appearance on the tennis court in Essex on Tuesday echoes her first solo appearance four months after the birth of Prince George.Then, she wore identical skinny jeans to take part in a game of volley-ball — and her Breton shirt rose up to reveal a stomach that was already wash-board flat.Her decision to wear a similar figure-hugging outfit this week shows how confident the Duchess is that she’s pulled it off again.A royal insider says: ‘Kate was concerned about the effects on her figure of a third child, particularly as she is also moving towards her late 30s. So she has made an extra special effort in toning up.’GOODBYE TO KOHL THAT Kate has instantly taken years off her looks by dispensing with the heavy kohl eye-liner which she was still wearing as recently as Prince Louis’s christening in July.Celebrity make-up artist Lauren Naylor says: ‘Kohl eyeliner around the entire eye can make them look smaller, and can be ageing, too.’Instead, taking a leaf out of sister-in-law Meghan’s book, Kate has switched to techniques to lift and open up her eyes by lining only the upper inner rim to reinforce the lash line and create a more subtle effect.          Kate has taken years off her looks by getting rid of the heavy kohl eye-liner she was still wearing as recently as JulyOn visits to Sloane Square department store Peter Jones, Kate picks favourite items from Bobbi Brown’s range, of which Meghan is also a fan.Her favourite items are Sandwash Pink lipstick and Saddle pencil to add definition to her eyebrows. Lauren says: ‘The colours she’s using give her complexion more warmth, so she’s glowing.ABS ATTACKTo HOME-in on her abs, Kate has been performing multiple sets of leg raises on a large mat, while resting her head on a feather pillow, according to a palace insider. This helps to bring the rectus abdominis — or ‘six pack’ muscles that separate in pregnancy — back together again.          The mother-of-three regularly exercises making sure she swims and works on her abs at homeKate is also said to like the Mutu System — a 12-week online programme of post-natal exercise to address this and also strengthen her pelvic floor.THAT WASPISH WAISTKate has a slender waist for any woman — let alone a 36-year-old mother of three.As well as eating well and exercising, she appeared to have gained barely more than 2st during her third pregnancy.Her secret is her on-going dedication to developing strong core muscles with regular post-natal abdominal exercises. While most mums have to trek to the gym, Kate is lucky enough to have the run of the state-of-the-art equipment at her Kensington Palace home.After the school run, she also visits her sister, Pippa, who recently gave birth to her first child, at her £17 million stucco-fronted mansion — which also has a high-tech fitness studio.The sisters are said to follow up their sessions, set to their favourite music, with a massage and a light organic lunch.Kate also enjoys plenty of spinning on her exercise bike, and cycles in the Norfolk countryside when she wants some fresh air.THE ARMS RACE Swimming plenty of lengths at the private pool at Buckingham Palace — a ten-minute drive from her private apartment at Kensington Palace — has also sculpted Kate’s lean arms.It’s also where she has taught her children to swim. An insider says: ‘Kate is a fast and effortless swimmer and has given George and Charlotte great water confidence.’Kate and William also have a private swimming pool at Anmer Hall, Norfolk, the private family home given to them by the Queen. On previous royal tours, Kate has told well-wishers she also keeps fit by ‘running after (the) kids’.Her other arm exercises are racing six-month-old Louis in his pushchair around the gardens of Kensington Palace — to his squeals of delight, closely followed by the family’s cocker iel, Lupo.STRIKE A POSEKate has concentrated hard on her posture. After the birth of Prince George, she has worked with personal trainer Louise Parker, who believes that every baby can take its toll.She has said: ‘Your posture needs a lot of auto-correction after pregnancy, so make sure you are opening up your chest, strengthening your upper back and your core.’Kate also looks long and lean, thanks to practising yoga.Although Meghan has the reputation for being the royals’ biggest devotee, Kate is also a keen follower of the discipline.While Meghan practises Vinyasa, which emphasises the smooth flow of movements, Kate follows Iyengar, which puts the emphasis on alignment and precision — and is also responsible for streamlining Nigella Lawson’s figure. As a result, Kate is more supple than she has ever been.WHAT A RACKETIt’s no wonder Kate looked so keen to pick up a tennis racket this week. As well as being the patron of The All England Club, home of the Wimbledon tournament, Kate is a mad-keen player.When in London during term-time, the family are regular players at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham, where there the dress code is that all tennis wear must be 80 per cent white. Kate has been spotted there perfecting her impressive serve.          Her family are regular players at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham and Kate is keen to get her eldest children playing tennis. Pictured Kate is joining a session as Basildon Sporting VillageShe has also worked hard to start George and Charlotte in the sport, saying that her eldest child already loves to ‘whack’ the ball.Observers who have seen the children on court say they are showing early signs of good hand-eye co-ordination.Kate is always up for a game of singles, too, against her husband.She has been overheard saying it’s one of the only sports in which she can beat William, who is also a keen all-round sportsman.GOLDEN GLOWMuch of Kate’s glow is down to plenty of exercise, fresh air and a consistently healthy diet. Her long devotion to sun protection has helped keep the first signs of ageing at bay.Instead, Kate gets a light glow from applying self-tan from the Xen Ten range — topped with a sweep of Bobbi Brown Shimmer Brick Bronze Shimmer.          Kate is said to wear ankle weights during gym sessions to help her keep her toned legsBlessed with good genes from her youthful-looking parents, Michael and Carole, it’s not thought that she has ever resorted to the Botox needle to keep any royal frown lines at bay.The Duchess is said to keep her complexion smooth with oxygen-infused products from Swiss skincare brand Karin Herzog.Since her pregnancy with Princess Charlotte, she has also been a devotee of rose hip oil to help guard against stretch marks.  PERFECT PINSThe 5ft 9in Duchess has always prided herself on her long, shapely legs. While they have always been strong, Kate’s legs have stayed toned, thanks to her regular half-hour running sessions. During her gym sessions, she also makes sure they get extra attention by wearing ankle weights while doing leg extension exercises to work her hamstrings. To avoid saddle-bags and to get the smooth silhouette that was on display this week, Kate also does sets of abductor and adductor exercises to target the inner and outer thigh muscles — as well as alternate lunges. THE QUEEN OF LEAN Despite having given birth to three children, Kate has barely gained a pound since her royal wedding day in April 2011.While she does not believe in dieting as such, she always makes health-conscious choices about what she eats, favouring smoothies.Kate is said to enjoy a green juice daily, often containing the algae spirulina, kale or spinach.She was also coached by lifestyle guru Louise Parker, author of Lean For Life: The Cookbook, after the birth of Prince George in 2013.Parker’s advice to clients is not to eat any white carbs until they have reached their goals. Recommended breakfasts include bircher muesli with oat bran topped with blueberries, snacks of oat cakes with peanut butter or hummus and lunches of lean protein and salads flavoured with garlic, ginger, herbs or lemon."},{"url":null,"title":"Hammond met betting giant curbs delayed","story":"    The row over the influence of the gambling lobby deepened last night after it emerged that Philip Hammond met one of the country’s largest betting firmsAnd his deputy, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, had another ‘round table’ meeting with the firm in May.In addition, Treasury officials met representatives of the Association of British Bookmakers to discuss the Government’s review of gambling laws.Miss Crouch quit in protest at Mr Hammond delaying the promised reduction in the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2.In her resignation letter, she expressed her anger at the gambling lobby, saying the decision had been taken following ‘commitments made by others to those with registered interests’.

Alongside Paddy Power Betfair were firms such as Heineken and Sky.In October 2017 and April 2018, Treasury officials met representatives of the Association of British Bookmakers. No ministers were present. Officials discussed the ABB’s submission to the gambling review on FOBT stakes. These meetings were revealed following a Freedom of Information request by Matt Zarb-Cousin from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling.Miss Crouch’s resignation on Thursday shocked Westminster. It emerged last night that a Commons vote on the secondary legislation needed to bring in the curbs on FOBT stakes was being delayed amid the threat of a rebellion by Tory backbenchers.Last night a Treasury spokesman said: ‘Treasury ministers, like all Government ministers, meet a wide variety of stakeholders in their work.

Claudia noticed a big change in her confidence as the weight began to fall off and she joined a dance class as well as a cheerleading squad and strength class when going back to universityHowever she said this time she was determined and re-joined her local group at the Dove Centre in Formby which is run by consultant Carol Wylie.And she was amazed when the weight began to drop off her.She said: \u0027It was hard to begin with because I was used to being able to eat whatever I wanted but I soon realised I could still have things I liked, just in moderation.\u0027I lost weight quite quickly and was losing half a stone in two weeks and within a year I had lost the majority of my weight.\u0027Claudia has so far dropped an incredible 9st 3lb, and now weighs 12st 2lb - with her obese frame a distant memory.Even more amazingly she has managed to drop a staggering seven dress sizes and is now a size 1012.But the biggest change Claudia has noticed in herself is her confidence and her weight loss has allowed her to do something she has always dreamed of.She said: \u0027I have always been interested in performing arts and have sang since I was a young girl.\u0027So when I started to lose the weight I decided to join a dance class and was shocked when I could actually keep up with the others.\u0027I had always wanted to go to university and I know now that it was my weight that jeopardised my course and made me to drop out the first time.\u0027So I applied for a performing arts degree and had to audition and I got offered a place.\u0027Claudia, who is now studying at Edge Hill University, dances twice a week, is part of a cheerleading team and a strength class - and said she is even nearly able to do the splits.She added: \u0027I just love being active now.\u0027My mum used to be the one telling me to get up and do things and now she is telling me to slow down.\u0027But it\u0027s like I can finally do everything I have wanted to do now.\u0027I am trying to make up for lost time and I just want to give everything a go.  Claudia, who is now studying at Edge Hill University, used to be told by her mother mother to \u0027get up and do things\u0027 who is now telling her to slow down\u0027I love going out with my friends, whereas before I would make up excuses and shy away from photos but it\u0027s not a problem now.\u0027I love getting dressed up too. I think the only bad thing about my weight loss is the amount of clothes I have bought.\u0027Claudia added: \u0027My friends and colleagues can just see what a better person I am now and how much I have come out of my shell.\u0027I will have banter in work whereas before I just kept myself to myself.\u0027I think my mum is the most proud of me though as she has always wanted me to do it.\u0027And Claudia has some advice for others trying to lose weight.She said: \u0027Join Slimming World, but do it for yourself. Quick fixes don\u0027t work.\u0027Slimming World makes you change the way you look and feel about food.\u0027The changes I\u0027ve made were so simple - little things like switching white bread for wholemeal and using low-calorie cooking spray instead of lots of oil.\u0027And now I can live my life to my full potential.

But why does the whole King’s Cross scheme not quite feel real?I am reading the most pretentious and verbose label ever attached to tea towel. If it were a caption next to a work of contemporary art, you would think it excessive. The towel, to give you a condensed version, “twists the traditional expression of a kitchen textile” with “a vibrant mélange look”, achieved by doing interesting things to yarns and twill stripes, it “adds a contemporary edge to the kitchen”. The tea towel costs £15. Fifteen pounds! Enough to say that it’s a very nice towel, if not one worth the price nor the word count on the label, and that it epitomises a certain sort of contemporary retail that is writ large in the shopping development around it, Coal Drops Yard in King’s Cross, London.That is to say, it is a thing of use and craft repackaged by design and marketing so as to soak up some of the surplus value sloshing around the credit-card accounts of the modern well-healed urbanite. It touches a desire for the artisanal, a nostalgia for the authentic and the workaday, for those very things that are squeezed out of city life by the self-same economic forces that enable a high-end, 9,290 sq metre, £100m shopping complex such as Coal Drops Yard to come into being in what was formerly an industrial, and then an ex-industrial, badland.And so it is with Coal Drops Yard as a whole, which is formed out of the two long Victorian sheds through which south Yorkshire coal was once transferred, at a rate of 8m tonnes a year, to horse-drawn carts and thence taken to heat the homes and businesses of London. Which facility, dealt fatal blows by competition from other sources of power, fell into decay. One part was gutted by fire. Another was colonised by Bagley’s nightclub, which until it closed in 2007 held raves 2,500-strong. They formed part of a wider zone of dereliction branded by its prostitution and drug-dealing, even as respectable light industrial businesses continued to ply their trade.This zone is now a fading memory, having been made into its near-opposite by the developers Argent – clean, prosperous, safe and managed, where before it was dirty, rundown, risky and anarchic. Service industries replace industrial industries. Yet it keeps mementoes of its former state, such as gas holders, storage buildings and canal and railway structures, partly because their retention is required by policies about historic buildings, but also because they add to the attraction of the place.Coal Drops Yard, where established brands such as Aesop and Paul Smith are combined with a careful selection of newcomers, is a culminating point in the almost-complete transformation of King’s Cross. It is part of the development’s coming-out as a frankly posh place, having previously taken care to dress down, to take both symbolic and material steps to make itself part of the everyday London demotic. It is a place where, at the exceptional tapas joint Barrafina, you can experience the most exquisite pureed beetroot of your life, at a high price.The yard lets itself go architecturally: having previously favoured some of Britain’s more meticulous and measured architects, Argent has now enlisted the help of the design Aladdin Thomas Heatherwick. With a rub of his magic lamp, he has caused the slate roofs of the two long sheds to soar from their supporting brickwork and meet above a central void in an airborne kiss. With the same rub he has made a hefty chunk of additional retail space, enough to contain a Samsung “creative and digital playground”, in a location where the official s of historic buildings would normally look askance at such a thing.Heatherwick’s superstructure grabs attention, which is what shopping centres tend to do, and he does it with more chutzpah than most. It first gives an instant and Instagrammable visual hit later it delivers a view over surrounding rooftops which Samsung’s patrons will enjoy when its store opens early next year. Heatherwick’s team have created some meaty and pleasing details in the historic structures underneath and nicely inserted staircases and walkways into the old shells, with unglazed arches conveying an aura of ruins. But the sheds are overwhelmed by acting as launchpads for the main architectural event. The underworld formed beneath the flying Samsung playground feels a tad glum.Vogue has called the shopping centre “progressive”, which is a striking adaptation to retail of a word more often linked to political idealism. Heatherwick told the Daily  of the project’s social value: “With the decline in other public gathering points,” he said, “church, for example, or public libraries and community centres which aren’t being financed now – we need places to come to for human interaction.” Time to give up on civic life, he seems to be saying, let’s go shopping.Language like this rinses substantial concepts of their meaning, the better to use them as marketing. A library, a shop – what’s the difference? It seems to confirm what critics of the King’s Cross development argue, that it is really about expanding the wealthy core of London into an area that was previously mixed, and that its values are ultimately those of retail and property. For Michael Edwards, a planning expert at University College London and a King’s Cross campaigner since the 1980s, “there’s very little there for people on low income or needing public services”. It’s part, he says, of a London-wide process whereby “big capital squeezes out anything noisy, anything scruffy, anything that can’t pay higher rents”.The rhetoric of Coal Drops Yard certainly raises some questions about both the successes and limits of the model that King’s Cross exemplifies, where developers, with the help of some nudges from public bodies and local groups, are the primary makers of cities. Developers become de facto mayors and planners, directing the provision of public good. They decide everything from the design of public and private buildings to the management and policing of open spaces. How far can the skill sets of benign administration and financial speculation be combined in one organisation? And, no matter how enlightened and intelligent a developer might be, what is to stop the profit motive finally taking over?Any assessment of the King’s Cross development has to acknowledge that it is the best of its kind, this being the transformation of a large area of a major British city by a single developer. Comparisons might be made with Birmingham’s Bullring and Liverpool One, which are both dominated by retail, or by the office-led Canary Wharf and Broadgate developments in London. The King’s Cross idea has always been to create what the development’s director Robert Evans calls “a part of London, a layered, complex, eclectic piece of the city,” which means it has several different uses.Across the whole 27-hectare (67-acre) King’s Cross site you can see the judicious detailing arising from the judicious choice of leading and emerging architects that this year won Argent the accolade of client of the year from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In the centre is the Central St Martins arts college, housed since 2011 in a conversion of Lewis Cubitt’s impressive 1852 granary building. This is a win-win for both Argent and the academic institution, whereby the latter got a handsome new home and the former found its property animated, which was particularly important in its fragile early years, by thousands of creative and stylish art students.At the heart of it all is Granary Square, a paved area in front of the granary building. In warm weather children play in the vertical jets of water that rise from the ground. People lounge on steps descending to the Regent’s Canal or gather to watch major sporting events on a big screen. Off to the side you can browse a bookshop in a moored narrowboat, from which wafts the sounds of jazz trumpet. Off to another is the Camley Street Natural Park, an achievement of 1980s community activism, once threatened with destruction, now preserved and flourishing.Art students float through, dressed in their takes on the bohemianism of the past 100 years: oh look, there’s David Bowie, or Samuel Beckett, or Siouxsie Sioux, or Gertrude Stein, or Yoko Ono, or Kerouac, or Warhol. Anyone is welcome, as long as they obey the rules lightly enforced by friendly red-hatted security personnel – families from nearby council estates, executives at the advertising and tech companies now locating here, journalists (full disclosure) from the offices of the Observer and the , which are just off the Argent estate.All this is made possible by a rare degree of long-term thinking in turn made possible by special circumstances. One is that the main backers are pension funds, which by their nature take a long view of investments. Another was a seven-year period before construction could start, as the high-speed line to the Channel tunnel was being built across the site, which gave time for considered planning and consultation.Also significant was the fact that there had been less sensitive proposals for the site, in the early 90s, which had prompted the formation of strong-minded local opposition groups. This episode had made the borough of Camden, in whose territory most of the King’s Cross site falls (the rest is in Islington) sceptical about property companies. Locals and politicians created pressure that developers couldn’t ignore. Then, in the early years of this century, it required thoughtfulness, patience and diplomacy on all sides to come up with the plan that is now being realised.Two iniduals in particular made it happen – Camden’s then director for the environment Peter Bishop, recently described to me as a “saint” by one who has seen him in action, and Argent’s then chief executive Roger Madelin, who went to meeting after meeting with the area’s very many interested parties. Madelin also used to show diagrams of the many constraints governing the site: mainline trains, underground trains, the canal, listed buildings, a corridor protecting the view of St Paul’s Cathedral from Hampstead Heath, which limits the height of buildings.Given so many pressures and constraints, a certain defensiveness was to be expected. Madelin was never going to give himself an additional degree of difficulty by commissioning an architecturally radical scheme. In any case this was the spirit of the age – thanks partly to the intervention of Prince Charles, during the 1980s, in the proposed redevelopment of Paternoster Square, next to St Paul’s, singular monoliths were out. Constructed variety, in which different architects give different wrappings to fundamentally similar office or apartment blocks, was in.Argent hired the classicising architect Demetri Porphyrios and the tactful practice of Allies and Morrison to produce a masterplan of traditional urban forms – city blocks arranged around squares and streets, whose formality is then offset by the asymmetries and incidents of the site. An agreeable fiction is created, that these blocks were not all created by a single entity at about the same time. A number of styles co-exist: emulations of continental housing blocks in textured brickwork, the diluted classicism of a Porphyrios office building, an aesthetic that Evans calls “industrial luxury”, expressed by the satisfyingly sturdy cast-iron columns of an office block by David Chipperfield, or by the rust-coloured oxidised steel of another by Eric Parry.So how, then, could anyone complain? How many more goodies will we demand from the developers’ sack of gifts? And why am I possessed by the irrational desire to hire a small submarine and torpedo the blameless jazz-playing floating bookshop? How churlish can you be?The first and maybe least important quibbles are architectural. Many of the buildings are handsome and few are poor, but eventually the dissembling of power and the avoidance of conflict become oppressive, or enervating, or both. It’s great that Argent have restored the mighty industrial structures, products of more brutal economics than those of the current development, but they are somehow neutered by the tasteful landscaping and cladding that surrounds them. One of the old gasholders is left as an empty frame, for example, a powerful structure that needs no embellishment. But embellished it is, by a fussy installation of mirrors at its base.There’s awkwardness and rigidity at the edges of the different elements, a lack of give and take that becomes acute where the development’s north-eastern boundaries meet the rest of the world. There’s indeterminacy in the spaces between contrasting structures. Before this was a place of drama, made of shifts of level and clashes of scale. Now it’s smoothed out, tending towards the condition of a high-design tea towel. It’s possible that the forthcoming Google HQ, a 1,000ft long beast by Heatherwick and the Danish-American practice BIG, will do something to counter this tameness. It will have, at the minimum, a certain confidence and consistency.More generally, unease comes from management and the feeling of being managed, the sense that everything is calculated and little is truly spontaneous. The presence of art and music highlight this feeling, these being activities that live off improvisation and the unpredictable. You know that if anything genuinely challenging happened here it would be escorted off the premises.Granary Square, along with most of the streets and squares, are examples of what is now called Pops – privately owned public space – since the London borough of Camden has so far declined an option to adopt them, presumably because it doesn’t want to pay the running costs. Argent points out that all such space was previously shut off from public use, sometimes with brick walls, so it has taken nothing away from the public realm. Rather, it has added something new, but it’s still the case that its Pops doesn’t feel like an actual piece of city. Among the signs is that the homeless, if they are there at all, keep a very low profile. They certainly don’t ask you for money.Everyone who enjoys Granary Square is in effect a guest of Argent, which means that subtle shifts in management could make them less welcome in the future which, if Coal Drops Yard is the future, would be bad news for people who don’t want to buy fancy tea towels and Aesop soap. At present it is part of the mix, a spot of West End luxury to go with everything else. Anyone can go there, if they like, to gawp at the Heatherwick kiss or watch their fellow citizens, but there’s not much to make them linger if they don’t want to shop. If the Coal Drops ethos becomes that of the whole estate, and the coming of Google is likely to push it that way, then Argent’s ambitions to make it an everyday bit of London will fail.On the scale of iniquities and crudeness of which property development is capable, any chinks in Argent’s virtue are minor stuff. It’s also hard to know what Argent could do to counter the feeling that it’s a bit too neat and tidy – hire dirt consultants? Permit licensed beggars? Curate prostitution? I’d say it could push its architecture harder and generally lighten up a bit. Otherwise King’s Cross is what it is, namely the work of a single estate, which is a London tradition: it’s how areas such as Bloomsbury and Belgravia got built. The upside is that the job actually gets done, and that places like Granary Square can be created. The downside is the over-managed feel.In a better world King’s Cross would set a standard from which to improve. It’s possible that Madelin, who is now working on the redevelopment of Canada Water in south London, will achieve just that. But in other parts of the capital, in Vauxhall Cross and around the Old Kent Road, current and planned development is unlikely to reach the levels of consideration and public benefit achieved by the collaboration of Camden and Argent, not least because local authorities have been significantly weakened. One day this might change. Meanwhile it’s useful to see King’s Cross for what it is: an impressive achievement, but a not a normal piece of city."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4965ec2d23d07b428ad3bff04612de165cd6c1/0_123_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df55acea91cf6fa9fcf15314548ddc6c","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The migrant caravan in Mexico, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, funerals in Haiti and Simone Biles at the world gymnastics championships – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c040cc5e91f50acdb48520955ba2df8d0bfc6870/0_1461_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc6bf93841b506fd3be8336115af1898","title":"the artist putting rubbish to visionary use in pictures","story":"“I wanted to give trash a second chance,” says Cyrus Kabiru, 34, who makes art – including highly decorative eyewear – out of wires, pins, bottle tops and other detritus he finds on the streets of Nairobi and around the world.

Constantly checking social media, making it impossible to concentrate on a task at hand? Disconnecting and eliminating disruption could be just what you needFrench artist Paul Cézanne once remarked: “It’s so fine and yet so terrible to stand in front of a blank canvas.”Today, the challenge is not so much to begin a task, but to complete it. Digital innovators make a virtue of disruption, but their innovations have also had a more literal impact on our lives. Creative technologies have proliferated – you can make an album in your bedroom, write and publish a novel and create and display your artwork – but so have the number of channels vying for your attention.Any project you begin runs the risk of frequent distraction from multiple sources such as the constant, nagging hum of social media updates, group notifications and message alerts.There is no denying the power mobile phones hold over us. There’s even a phenomenon known as “phantom vibration syndrome”, which is the perception that your phone is buzzing when it’s not.It is a daily challenge to shut off the deluge of stimuli and try to focus, to centre yourself and be imaginative. It was the philosopher Aristotle who first put forward the idea of the tabula rasa: the young mind as a blank slate. In the literal sense, nothing relates to this more than the process of beginning to work on an empty page.Jackie Andrade, professor of psychology at University of Plymouth, wrote a paper in 2009, where she supported the use of doodling as a cognitive process and aid for reducing daydreaming.Pen and paper are the original, and perhaps the ultimate creative platform, providing a physical connection between the mind and a tool for expression. They fuel the imagination and solidify thought.“There was a study (pdf) that compared students writing on paper and those writing notes on a keyboard, and the former came out better in tests. If you’re typing on your computer, whether you get notifications or not, you’re tempted to look in case there’s something there. You’re pulled away in case there’s an email or something might be happening on Facebook. That doesn’t exist if you use a pen and pad. Those notifications are really disruptive, it’s not just reading them, it’s the time it takes to refocus on the task. That’s a powerful reason to write on paper, whether it be real or digital.”What if there was a medium that provided a bridge between physical writing or drawing and the capability of a digital device, but with none of the disruption? Well, there is. reMarkable is a paper tablet that’s so natural and adaptable that it makes notebooks, sketchbooks and printouts redundant. It offers a paper-like reading, writing and drawing experience in a tactile device that filters out the digital noise around you.“There’s a digital epidemic going on right now.

He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and has won numerous awards, including the Theakston’s Old Peculier crime novel of the year award and the CWA lifetime achievement award. His latest Rebus novel (the 22nd), In a House of Lies, entered the bestseller charts at No 1.You retired Rebus from the police force in 2007 (in Exit Music), but he still wants to help solve crimes. How much of a challenge is that creatively?I’ve got this guy in his mid-late 60s who doesn’t have a warrant card, can’t blithely walk into any police station and get past the front desk. So if he wants to be a detective, he’s got to find ways past that. I really enjoy that challenge – it keeps me on my toes.Rebus’s unconventional, old-fashioned policing techniques solve crimes that modern, by-the-book policing can’t. Are you nostalgic for Rebus’s policing methods?When I started writing the Rebus books I was a big fan of the American private eye story and I always envisaged Rebus as a kind of private eye within the police. He’s not going to work well as part of a team, he’s going to want to be out doing his own thing, sometimes bending the rules as far as he can. So now that’s how he operates. He’s doing this partly for his own satisfaction and partly because he just feels driven. He feels detective work has been his whole life. Also, he’s at a certain age now where he’s looking around at the world and wondering if he still makes a difference. Does he still have a role to play? And getting involved with the police, trying to solve mysteries – that’s his way of answering that question.Rebus struggles with modern technology and social media, and a lot of the novel’s humour comes from that. How has social media changed the way you write about policing?Rebus is bewildered at the speed of change around him. The media used to be fairly easy to control because there wasn’t much of it, but now everybody’s the media. If you have a social media presence – a blog, or a vlog, or are on Twitter – you’re reporting stuff all the time, and there are no filters. And the police are trying to use social media to get word out, but there’s no control over the dissemination of that.You’ve acknowledged in the past that Rebus is to some extent your alter ego. Has he become more or less like you over the years?Blessedly, I’ve never smoked. I’m 58. Like Rebus, as Leonard Cohen famously said, “I ache in the places where I used to play.” My knees are going, my hearing’s going, my eyesight’s going, and you do start thinking: “How much longer have I got? What have I got left that I want to say?” I’m not at the stage yet of reading really short books because I might not make it to the end of a long book, but it can’t be too far away.Did you grow up in a bookish house?Not at all. If my parents read at all, they read during their summer holiday. But we had a little local library in our village and that was the saving grace. I’d go to the library and take out the maximum number of books I could.Did your parents first take you to the library?Yeah, my mum. I always read a lot of comics. I still love comics because they’re affordable literacy. For a whole generation of kids, it got them into reading and it was a rung of the ladder that would eventually lead to books. I used to hang out in the library too, once I was old enough to go there on my own.What kind of things were you reading?At 12 I was reading The Godfather – I read the book because I wasn’t old enough to see the film. The same went for A Clockwork Orange and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Jaws and The Exorcist. I wanted to know this world that was taboo, that I wasn’t supposed to know about.Which writers most influenced your writing?Muriel Spark was a huge influence. The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie – one of my favourite books ever – led me down this rabbit hole because Miss Jean Brodie is descended from a real-life Edinburgh character, William Brodie, who was gentleman by day and thief by night. So he became one of the influences for Jekyll and Hyde. Another influence was a book called Confessions of a Justified Sinner, by James Hogg, which is one of the first serial-killer novels.Is there a book you really wish you’d written yourself?A Dance to the Music of Time, by Anthony Powell. That book was a fascinating primer for me in how to write a sequence of books with the same cast of characters, and having the main character age along the way. This notion that life is a dance to the music of time – if you’re writing a series it’s crucial to know how to do it.What about a book that’s highly acclaimed but you think is overrated?There’s a lot of great literature I’ve tried reading and couldn’t. War and Peace and Middlemarch I didn’t really get on with. The literary novel sometimes disappoints me. When I was at university I was a big fan of Thomas Pynchon, and I’ve tried some of the writers who have come after him and not really enjoyed them. I’m at an age now where if I’m not enjoying a book I tend to put it aside rather than fight my way to the bitter end. There are a hell of a lot of books out there I still want to read before I go.Which literary figures, dead or alive, would you most like to meet?I’d love to meet Robert Louis Stevenson, and particularly to ask him one specific question: what was in the original manuscript of Jekyll and Hyde? Because famously his wife, Fanny, handed the manuscript back to him and told him it was no good, and he burned it. I mean, did he really do that? I just find it extraordinary that a writer would do that to their own work. But also, why? Was it too close to home?Who would you like to write the story of your life?I don’t want anybody writing my biography. I talk through my characters and I talk through my novels – that’s me. I would rather people knew me through the books. I kept a diary from the age of 12 until I was in my mid-30s, and I’ve been through them and thought, Jesus, Ian, it’s just so boring.What was the last great book you read?John Niven’s Kill ’Em All, which is a follow-up to Kill Your Friends. It really is Martin Amis’s Money for the Trump age. It’s ludicrous and laugh-out-loud funny and filthy.What do you have on your bedside table to read next?I’m halfway through the new Michael Connelly, Dark Sacred Night. After that I’ve got Robin Robertson, The Long Take, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize. I taught on the creative writing course at UEA and one of my students, Elizabeth Macneal, has a book coming out next year that I’m really excited about called The Doll Factory.• In a House of Lies by Ian Rankin is published by Orion (£20).

I waded into it having only a general idea of what transpired and came away stunned by what actually took place, and the ways in which the truth has been suppressed and distorted for almost 50 years. The legacy can be seen in the manufactured war on drugs and the skyrocketing rate of mass incarceration in the US. This book should be required reading.The last book that made me cry Aside from Blood in the Water, I was moved by John Williams’s Stoner, that short, once-forgotten novel about a stifled academic in Missouri.

A new film marking the centenary of his death explores the refuges he sought away from the battlefieldI spent my childhood holidays in Torquay, but I’d forgotten how blue its waters were. Meadfoot beach arcs around the bay, looking out to a single, sharp rock in the distance, angular, as if driven from the sky into the sea. In the years before the first world war, the teenage Wilfred Owen spent his own summers on this beach. He’d always loved the water. His father taught him to swim Tom Owen was a railway clerk in Shrewsbury, but on his days off he’d dress up as a captain and wander Liverpool’s docks. Once he brought home four Lascars Wilfred and his brother Harold remembered their bare brown feet beneath the tea table.Wilfred knew where his future lay. His heroes had been drawn to this turquoise sea: Percy Shelley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Oscar Wilde. In the summer of 1911, he made the pilgrimage to nearby Teignmouth, where John Keats had stayed in 1818. “In love with a dead ’un”, he wrote a sonnet to the Romantic poet – “Watery memorials of His mystic doom  Whose Name was writ in Water (saith his tomb) ...  Eternally may sad waves wail his death” – and followed it with his first long poem, a rewriting of “The Little Mermaid”, with Keatsian images of “blunt-snouted whales” and the sense that he had put himself in the place of the mermaid who sacrificed her voice to become a human for her prince.The sea embodied Owen’s ambitions, both literary and sensual. It would bear him up and carry him away. He was a boy of the fin de siècle: he read Wilde and Yeats, loved his favourite green suit and grew his hair floppy and long. In the summer of 1914, his youthful prospects took a decadent turn. Having failed to get into college, he found himself in southern France, acting as a tutor to an artistic family. He met his first real live poet: Laurent Tailhade, an opium addict and anarchist who’d declared a terrorist bomb in Paris to be a beautiful gesture. Tailhade “slobbered over” Owen, who accepted the compliment. As his biographer Dominic Hibberd notes, this strange meeting would invest his work with its power like Tailhade, he would find art in disaster. As he wrote of swimming in mountain pools in jagged pararhymes, he believed he was doing in poetry what modernist composers were doing in music.Boys Breaking the surface of the ebony pond.Flashes Of swimmers carving through the sparkling coldFleshes Gleaming with wetness to the morning gold.War came like a stain. He would not fight for king and country, but for poetry. He enlisted in the Artists Rifles it was another aesthetic transformation. Body tightened by training, hair cropped, he saw himself as a shape-shifter – a bird, a wolf, a faun – in an industrial conflict. “If I fall, I shall fall mightily. I shall be with Perseus and Icarus, whom I loved and not with Fritz, whom I do not hate. To battle with the Super-Zeppelin, when he comes, this would be chivalry more than Arthur dreamed of.”The reality, when he met it, was shocking. At the western front he found a terrifying beach where fetid water swilled in craters so deep that his men stole lifejackets from cross-Channel ferries to save themselves from drowning. Tanks – called land ships – surfed the mud gas-masked soldiers peered out of trenches through subaquatic periscopes. It was a new, unnatural history, fearfully evoked in “Dulce et Decorum Est”.Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,As under a green sea, I saw him drowningHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.He remembered The Tempest all the devils were here, in this never-ending storm. The night before an attack, he supervised his men by ritualistic candlelight as they rubbed whale oil into their feet. 175,000 whales died to furnish that stuff, and to supply glycerine for bombs. It was the first war of the anthropocene. Owen’s mentor, Siegfried Sassoon, was stunned when he was told that the war was being fought “for Mesopotamian oil”.Playing his part, Owen carried poetry into battle: the strange, futuristic work of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and the perfervid verse of Swinburne, each with their own mortal relationships to the sea. Thrown in the air by an explosion, he fell to earth, transformed anew. Shellshocked, he was sent to Netley hospital, a vast Victorian establishment overlooking Southampton Water. “I cannot quite believe myself back in England in this unknown region,” he protested. He imagined that he had swum there.That same shore is where I grew up. It’s where I swim, too. Owen’s was the first poetry I ever appreciated. It was the early 1970s. I was obsessed with David Bowie – another shape-shifter – and Wilde. I felt a kinship with Owen: a young man like me, coming to terms with what the world regarded as natural, or unnatural. I realise now that my English teacher, a harried-looking man who seemed pained by the “real” world, was tapping into a greater awareness of Owen’s work. Owen had once been regarded as a minor figure, but it took the cold war and Vietnam to turn him into the James Dean of protest poetry. The famous, half-turned photograph, which in the original print glows with his tan and subtle smile, was polarised into a dark, gothic image.Benjamin Britten, a pacifist and conscientious objector, pre-empted the revival by adapting Owen’s poems in his 1962 War Requiem (staged this month by the ENO ). Britten’s opera – and later, Derek Jarman’s 1989 Aids-era film version – drew on the homoeroticism in Owen’s work. But the true nature of his sexuality remains as fluid as the sea in which he swam. After Owen’s death, his brother Harold inked out or tore entire pages from the poet’s letters and destroyed his only diary. Written in 1918, it would have given us vital insights into Owen’s last year, when he not only wrote some of the most powerful poems of 20th century literature, but also became part of what we would see as a gay literary circle.Owen’s poetry can’t be redacted. Its emotion is as bare as an exposed nerve. As a teenager, I felt the physical tug of “Disabled” and the soldier who’s told he’d look a god in a kilt. I sensed Owen’s subversive desires. Forty-five years later, they would resurface in my recent book, RISINGTIDEFALLINGSTAR, in which the poet is a central character, as he is in I Was a Dark Star Always, a short film I have made with Adam Low, with Owen’s words read by Ben Whishaw. Our film tries to see Owen not as a doomed hero but as an ambitious young man with a brilliant future to set him free from the perversity of war.Jon Stallworthy published his groundbreaking biography of Owen in 1974, while Harold was still alive. Later, in his controversial biography of 2002, Hibberd declared unequivocally that Owen was gay. In poems written as Owen roamed the backstreets of London and Edinburgh – Wildean visions of “godlike youths” with “blood-red lips” – Hibberd detected images of male prostitutes and lines such as “I needed, you ceded”, he traced the poet’s intense, possibly physical relationship with Charles Scott Moncrieff, later famed for his translation of Proust.This other life can be seen the lines of what remains. Owen wrote of opium dens in London’s West End, and, through Siegfried Sassoon, met Robbie Ross, Wilde’s first male lover and literary executor. Ross’s gesture to the war effort was to paint his Piccadilly apartment gold in protest. Owen rented a room above Ross’s, and attended Robert Graves’s wedding at St James’s, Piccadilly with Ross, all but on the older man’s arm. Owen’s friends included gay figures such as Harold Monro of the Poetry Bookshop, and Osbert Sitwell. None of this seems unintended.The last thing he did when he left England in August 1918 was to swim off Folkestone beach. Throughout his military career he had managed to satisfy his passion for swimming – from Yorkshire rivers to Scottish municipal pools - telling his beloved mother, Susan, that “it never fails to give me a Greek feeling of energy and elemental life”. If there was any doubt that Owen equated swimming with a potent sensuality, it is dispelled by this deliberate, final act.“My last hours in England were brightened by a bathe in the fair green Channel, in company of the best piece of Nation left in England – a Harrow boy”, he told Susan. To Sassoon, he was more revealing: “Moreover there issued from the sea distraction, in the shape, Shape I say, but lay no stress on that, of a Harrow boy, of superb intellect \u0026amp refinement intellect because he hates war more than Germans refinement because of the way he spoke of my Going, and of the Sun, and of the Sea there and the way he spoke of Everything. In fact, the way he spoke –”Two months later, Owen led his men into action in northern France. It was the last battle of the war peace was imminent. At Ors, where only months before they had swum naked in the Sambre-Oise canal, retreating German soldiers flooded the land. At 5.45 on the morning of 4 November, Owen and his company tried to cross a canal in the face of ferocious enemy fire. They breasted the surf of bullets, as he had written in “Spring Offensive”, his last poem, with its final line, “Why speak they not of comrades that went under?”Owen was seen encouraging his boys as they assembled rafts on the side of the canal. There are conflicting reports about what happened next. One claims he was still on the bank when he was shot the other that he was on a raft. I see him falling, like Icarus, into the dark water.In the village cemetery nearby, his name is cut into Portland stone, rather than written on water. The church bells are tolling. On 11 November, as her parish rang in the Armistice, Susan Owen received the telegram. Her son had died far from home. But in this peaceful place, with its lush fields and its gently flowing canal, I feel strangely happy for him. As if, at any moment, a short, sturdy young man with dark grey eyes might pad across to that same bank and, leaving his clothes in a pile on the grass, lower himself in, too.• I Was a Dark Star Always is at the John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, from 4 November to 25 January. jhg.art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af3233de5e14a878bcc1028c6cdca102fe194695/0_154_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21556a3c8bd7539910a2290015908e8","title":"sainsburys apology to readers over stew recipe","story":"Magazine apologises after British-Iranian readers say inclusion of recipe for curry is ‘lazy, casual racism’A sparkly bonfire night cake and a traditional English sausage and mash were both on offer in October’s edition of Sainsbury’s Magazine. More prominent than this seasonal fare, though, was a bold attempt to broaden readers’ horizons: a front-page photo of a “golden Persian curry”, tagged as “the dinner party dish you HAVE to try”.But the magazine’s fusion adventure has now backfired. Its editors stand accused of “lazy, casual racism” because, according to Iranian readers, chefs and fans of Persian cookery, the ingredients bear little or no relation to the region’s authentic cuisine.The culinary controversy soon spilled on to the pages of the journal’s Twitter feed and Instagram account, where accusations of sloppy “cultural appropriation” abounded, although they have since been taken down by the magazine. Reader Pooneh Arrondelle wrote: “This is NOT a Persian recipe, it can’t even be said to be inspired by Persian cuisine. No PersianIranian would ever mix these ingredients. You think sprinkling a few pomegranate seeds on to something makes it Persian?”British Iranian Banafsheh Hay was stirred to write directly to Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, asking for an apology, and she remains angered by the lack of care taken. “To treat Iranian and Indian cuisines as virtually indistinguishable, despite knowing in reality they are very different, in order to save their readers the effort to learn about a new Iranian cuisine which the magazine wants to promote on its front cover smacks of lazy, casual racism and is abhorrent,” she told the Observer.The words “Halloween horror”, also on the front page, had taken on an awful new meaning by the time the editor, Helena Lang, was forced to respond. Sainsbury’s “Persian curry” was merely “inspired” by Persian cuisine, she explained to Arrondelle in an email. It was based on “two traditional stews – khoresh and fesenjan”, Lang added. But the explanation only served to escalate the row.Arrondelle returned to Instagram to point out “khoresh” is not a traditional Persian dish, but merely the Farsi word for “stew”.The row comes in the wake of the resignation of Waitrose Magazine’s editor William Sitwell, who upset his publishers last week when news reached them of his “ill-judged joke” about “killing” the growing ranks of vegan eaters, “one by one”.Sainsbury’s Magazine, published by Seven, has issued an apology for any offence caused: “We love developing exciting recipes for Sainsbury’s customers and our inspiration comes from different cuisines around the world,” it reads. “We wanted to introduce Persian flavours to readers who may not have enjoyed them before, and so we created a recipe which is inspired by the traditional Persian dish Fesenjan, fused with an Indian-style curry.”And not everyone was disappointed by the recipe. Several readers have posted their approval, including Hayley Davies, who described the lamb curry she made as “delicious”.Nevertheless, Farshid Ziafat, owner of Hafez, one of London’s oldest Iranian restaurants, is clear no dish resembling Sainsbury’s stew exists in Iran. “Persian cuisine does not use any combination of dried spices remotely like curry powder in any recipe,” he said, denying that Fesenjan, his restaurant’s signature dish, could have provided inspiration, as it must contain pomegranate molasses and walnuts. It is a key traditional dish, brought out at weddings and celebrations as far back as the Persian empire.“It is not the first time that Sainsbury’s food writers have created a ‘Persian’-themed recipe and poorly researched the apparent ‘inspiration’ anyone with knowledge of our cuisine will spot the glaring error in this confused mash-up,” Ziafat said.Ali Bidarbakht, owner of popular Iranian restaurant Galleria in London’s Marylebone, agrees that Sainsbury’s “Persian Curry” front cover was badly conceived.“Sainsbury’s has taken an Indian or an Asian dish, and tried to link it to Persian cuisine, which is a big mistake,” he said.The rapid rise of the world food trend has led to other recent allegations of cultural appropriation or misrepresentation. When Jamie Oliver was accused of exploiting Jamaican heritage with his jerk rice dish, he argued he had been influenced by the cuisine, and was not copying it.Tamsin Burnett-Hall, Sainsbury’s Magazine’s food editor, took the same line on the disputed curry in a comment posted on her public Instagram.“As most recipe writers do, I often take inspiration from cuisines around the world and mix them with other ideas, to create new and exciting recipes,” she wrote. “Although we know ‘curry’ isn’t authentically Persian, we did feel the word went some way towards explaining what this delicious spiced dish might taste like, to British readers very used to eating Indian-style curries.”Hay said Burnett-Hall’s use of the phrase “British readers” was particularly annoying. “How do they define their ‘British readers’?” she asked. “Do they have a chart for all those readers who will be able to cope with a curry-free new cuisine and those that won’t? Sainsbury’s needs to get a grip and give its magazine’s readers more credit.”Sainsbury’s Magazine has replied: “We regret if the reference we made to ‘British readers’ has been misunderstood. This recipe was designed to encourage our readers to embrace a range of flavours from around the world and try new combinations they may not have tried before.”For Ziafat, the recipe’s worst crime was its treatment of saffron. “Instead of adding it at the end of cooking, you put it in at the start, thereby destroying its subtle aromatic flavour by stewing it for 90 minutes! This is the real sacrilege,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3b8ef500de6112da676693720cd294b12cdfa9/526_0_1687_1012/master/1687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8fd221bb8165b6286acc65454eec338","title":"brazil turkey slovakia tyranny contagion spreads around the world","story":"History will record that when states murdered journalists or used the conspiracy theories of terrorists to fool their subject populations, they could expect reprisals from something called “the west”, an alliance that lasted from 1945 to 2016. The west’s great weakness was that it depended on American power. It died when Donald Trump became the US president, freeing illiberal democracies and actual dictatorships to follow their worst instincts to a grim destination.Fashion affects the powerful as well as the powerless. They look at each other and learn what they can get away with. “Did you hear what happened in Germany?” Stalin asked Anastas Mikoyan in June 1934, after Hitler had ordered the murder of his enemies in the Nazi party. “Splendid! That’s a deed of some skill!” Inspired by Hitler’s Night of the Long Knives, Stalin began the executions of tens of thousands of communists who posed a real and imagined threat to his power. The west taught, albeit intermittently, albeit with immense blind spots in which crimes against humanity were committed with impunity, that governments had to pretend to protect human rights, freeish trade and democracy.Now, the US, the country that made the west and guaranteed its existence, teaches that none of the old rules applies. You bet the world is taking notice.It’s not that Trump is a fascist, as some of his more hyperventilating opponents claim. Fascists don’t allow midterm elections. When he says journalists are the “enemy of the people”, he is trying to brainwash his core voters into rejecting any portrayal that doesn’t show him as a superhero. Trump and his supporters revel in a wilful denial of reality. They demonstrate a delight in their brute power to dispense with truth and never face punishment for it.American journalists worry that the lies are so barefaced they will get a reporter murdered. They probably will an alleged rightwing terrorist has already tried to bomb CNN. But unlike genuine dictators, Trump cannot order the arrest of reporters who displease him. The real malice of his presidency lies in the permission he grants to regimes that can.In London last week, the Foreign Office helped arrange a conference for young journalists from semi-autocratic countries. When I spoke, I emphasised that British journalists should never allow anyone to call us “brave” or “courageous” or claim those titles ourselves. We can criticise politicians at will and never fear the sound of a policeman’s fist thumping on our doors. “Britain isn’t Turkey or Hungary or Malta,” I said.But before Trump, Malta wasn’t the Malta we now know: the rancid island where Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in 2017 after investigating money laundering and the sale of citizenship, and Malta’s Labour government responded by smearing her memory and the anti-corruption campaigners demanding answers. Slovakia wasn’t Slovakia until Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová were murdered by a contract killer after Kuciak investigated links between the mafia and the country’s elite. Robert Fico, the then prime minister, responded as Trump would have responded, denouncing the citizens who took to the streets as foreign agents in the pay of the demonic George Soros. Turkey was a Nato member and military dictatorship engaged in a civil war against its Kurdish minority when the supposedly “liberal” west was at its height in the 20th century – we should have no time for fake nostalgia. But in 2018, President Erdoğan has used the excuse of a failed coup to undertake a Stalinesque purge of the army, judiciary and civil service in which tens of thousands have been imprisoned or fired. Hundreds of journalists have been put on trial as “terrorists” or found themselves unable to work. One, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the assembled reporters that writing was his life, it was all he could do and all he wanted to do. But he was writing in a vacuum now: hardly anyone dared publish him.Aside from protesting about Turkey’s imprisonment of a US pastor, the Trump administration’s sole concern has been the grotesque game in which Erdoğan, who imprisons more journalists than any other tyrant on the planet, pretends to care about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi so he can score points against Saudi Arabia, which flogs and imprisons supporters of peaceful reform.No corrupt bureaucrat or vicious policeman in eastern Europe, Saudi Arabia, Malta or Turkey is restrained by fear of the west’s reaction, because Trump has closed the west down. The same indifference will be on display when Jair Bolsonaro gets to work on the opposition in Brazil.The effect Trump has on the world is as bad as, I would say worse than, his effect on America. No one will be able to prove that the gunman who killed 11 worshippers in a Pittsburgh synagogue would not have become a lethal antisemite if Trump were not screaming out the theory that George Soros was trying to flood white America with immigrants. But Viktor Orbán knows that the US will say nothing as he uses the same conspiracy theory as an excuse to rob Hungarians and deprive them of their liberties.Many will not miss the west. Few like foreigners telling them how to run their countries, even if their motives are impeccable. Western motives have been far from that. Since the start of the cold war, the charge has always been that former imperialists preached liberalism and democracy while supporting every type of Latin American torturer, African kleptomaniac and Middle Eastern autocrat. All that has been lost since Trump took power is the small chance that western governments could on occasion live up to their values.Those who believe that hypocrisy is the greatest vice ought to be relieved. But I doubt they will like the bare, unhypocritical world that is upon us. Everywhere, the depraved are looking at Trump as Stalin looked at Hitler and crying: “Splendid!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a324d9f58bea2d1c0568f187b4bd8e773e3e4f47/53_1132_2092_1254/master/2092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7117c1467c5a0ae293da8d118221150","title":"daves got on his excited face and im finally getting him out of the house","story":"Throughout her husband’s term in office, Samantha Cameron kept a regular diary, which only lapsed after an unwelcome referendum result made running away the only honourable course. Now, however, the revival of David Cameron’s political ambition finds her making this unexpected new entry…Well Mummy was not best pleased #epicunderstatement, she’s like excuse me since when does Dave look for a new job without asking me, the Fulham branch was literally expecting him next week?I’m like God I know? Because Dave was literally due to walk in my first *scream* Cefinn for Men collection, non swank but I had this like ine cheesecloth CFM zip-front siren suit all ready, in olive with like this red tie-belt and my signature contrast piping, as in totes, totes on fleek? Mummy’s like but darling what on earth possessed him, I hate to be the one to tell you but everyone is laughing?I’m like *dignified voice* without wishing to be controversial I believe people would have been impressed by Dave’s walking potential, wear-anywhere sports luxe can be über-flattering on the larger man plus referencing Churchill makes it very now, Andrew Roberts ordered one in every colour :))) Anyway Dave thought he’d be good at it. Mummy’s like no, what makes Dave even think he could go back, it’s not just the dreadful people, everyone knows the Johnsons were literally starving until he got his  column back, what about poor Elwen’s school, and don’t tell me Dave will have to give up shooting and take up religion again. It seems such a waste of his talents.I’m like well he needs something, we all agreed Nancy could move her hedge fund into the shepherd’s hut as soon she’d finished Dave’s book, but he won’t come out \u0026amp last week she gave him three days to get out or *maternal proud face* she’d tell everyone he’s actually spent the last two years getting to level 3800 of Candy Crush. Plus trust me, Dave desperately needs another challenge, he has not been this bored shitless since he finished Angry Birds, and that was when he still had Libya to keep him amused.Mummy goes all silent, so I’m like, OK I know politics is not really on trend RN, but appaz it can be totally addictive, not Candy Crush addictive, obvs, but Dave’s like, once you get all the way to holding-a-referendum level, even if it all crashes without being remotely your fault, you still crave that dopamine hit? Yes I know he talked about being a brain surgeon. Mummy’s like, he said he thought he’d be good at it, I’m like, yeah but now he thinks saving lives would bore him shitless too. Mummy’s like, lead violinist? Me: same. Commissioner of the politan police? Me: same. Archbishop of York? I’m like, same, plus he’s ruled out abroad. I’m not saying he wouldn’t be majorly good at them.Mummy’s like, why can’t he just find a little newspaper like the Osborne boy, or what is it young Clegg’s doing – what a towering shame Mr Zuckerberg didn’t think of Dave – or you could talk to the Murdochs, ghastly, I know, but so are the Goveys, and you used to adore them, same with Hilto, that Craig Whatever, the Johnsons, that little Rebekah Dave had such a crush on, wasn’t there a Freud, and who was that priceless Australian Dave knighted – Mr Cobber? – even the Philip Greens I seem to remember, goodness what people, oh how awful of me am I being tactless?I tell Mummy it’s not just Dave, Oik always pretends he loves journalism, except for the crap pay and taking Mr Lebedev’s suits to the cleaners, but he never stops going on about Theresa’s mutilated body, last time he brought a little diagram, lol, appaz he will not rest until she is buried under the Downing Street gents, I mean only when he’s prime minister, obvs. Honestly they’re both so excited for being back in office #bless, we’ve even bought Dave a globe, you should have seen his face when he found out that Libya isn’t landlocked.Well Mummy was incredibly kind to offer to put Dave in festive tableware, but like I said to Nancy, what if the hours clashed with his tennis, or stalking or a holiday? Or lunch, or a wedding, or a country supper, or a music festival, or an urgent binge-watching delivery? Because poor Dave has to chillax occasionally, though not at home, please God. That was when Nancy went calm it Mother, no, look at me, I’ve found the perfect way to get him out of the house, I’m like OMG *trembles* do not even think about sending me his resumé, hasn’t he done enough damage, do you have any idea what Brexit has done to cheesecloth prices?So she’s like, chill, Mum, where do they still employ Etonians – no, outside the theatre – even disgraced ones, with no recorded skills and a history of total irresponsibility? Yass, I’m putting Dad in the foreign office!So then we’re hammering on the hut, Dave’s like, go away I’m self-caring, Nancy’s like open the door before I kick it in, then I pause Killing Eve (ep 2, his fave), Nancy’s like, put the glass down, dude, I’m making you an elder statesman.I’m like oh my gucciness babes, it will be totally like when John Galliano came back and Anna Wintour like, reached out to him, I mean so totes humbling and emosh, Nancy’s like, earth to Mother, major difference, Galliano said sorry – how about it Dad?

The actor tells all about her breakdown and her hard-won recoverySheridan Smith arrives at the restaurant with a handsome new pet in tow, a grey puppy called Trevor who draws such a crowd of cooing admirers it takes a while before anybody notices the animal has laid a long, coy turd in the doorway. Waiters dash for tissues. Everyone is sympathetic poor Trev, obviously convinced he has created a public relations crisis for his owner, is now straining on his leash to hide among the pot plants. As for Smith – her 37 years rich with incident, a performer counted among the most gifted in the West End, an Olivier winner and a Bafta best actor who more recently went through an acute and very public breakdown – she just shrugs. Cleaning up crap in front of a crowd? Smith has been through worse.She settles at a table (puppy on the lap of her jeans, sleeves rolled to reveal forearm tattoos, blond hair tied back) and offers up an example. A few years ago, she was asked to appear on Who Do You Think You Are?, the TV show on which celebrities have their ancestry traced in order to learn deeper truths about themselves. Back then, Smith’s life in showbusiness looked – on the surface, anyway – a roaring success. Her name on a bill could sell out a show, and she was about to appear on screen as Cilla Black in a highly praised ITV biopic. On Who Do You Think You Are? she learned she had a great-grandfather who was also a talented performer, a pioneer on the banjo. Smith was delighted. “I was loving hearing about him,” she remembers. “All these beautiful links that I couldn’t wait to tell my family about.”But her great-grandfather’s life story soured as it went on. “We get to the end and I’m hearing that his wife has left him. He’s an alcoholic. He’s turned on the gas taps at home, and he’s stood there with a lighted match, telling the police to go away…” Smith pauses, smiling wryly, letting the irony sink in. Sometimes when famous people have been knocked around a bit by the tabloids, they assume you know all the particulars of their worst times. And to be fair to Smith I do know a lot of it, because there was a period in 2016 when you couldn’t avoid the coverage of her downward spiral – the missed curtain calls, the disgruntled audiences. After a cruel joke told about her at the Bafta award ceremony, inferring she was a drunk, Smith posted a slew of sweary, boozy, much-regretted tweets.Her appearance on Who Do You Think You Are? predated all this, and at the time she was keeping a public lid on her problems. Or as she puts it: “Not being honest with anyone about how much I was struggling, with drink, with my mental health. And when I heard all that about my great-grandfather, I’m sat there on TV saying, ‘Oh! Really! That’s so interesting...’ But you can see the tears start rolling down my face. And in my head I’m thinking, my God, the parallels. Is this all something that’s… genetic?”Officially we’re meeting to talk over a couple of new projects. There’s Cleaning Up, a six-part ITV drama about a cleaner (Smith) who struggles with an addiction to online gambling. And alongside that, Smith has recorded an album of original songs, on the back of a covers record she released last year before touring a one-woman show around the UK. We discuss them for a bit. But honestly? Smith, by her own admission, has never been much good at upselling her work. “Back when I started on TV, they sent me on a course, to teach me how to behave in interviews, like they do with politicians. I’m sat with this guy, I’m in my early 20s. He said, ‘No, you see, you’re answering my questions honestly.’ And I said, ‘But you asked.’”Fiddling with the straw in her soft drink, and stroking her dog, Smith veers on to more personal ground. Blessed with an orchestral Lincolnshire accent, and the instant likability that helped supercharge her rise in the first place, she’s a born storyteller – an arm-toucher, someone who says she feels freer talking about her difficulties now that a combination of proper treatment, a stable romantic relationship and rewarding work has helped steady her. While Trevor snores on her lap, Smith sits and talks – about the events that led to her collapse, how it felt to experience it from the inside, the ways in which she hopes other people will benefit from her speaking honestly about it.A couple of times Smith says things that, she admits, she hasn’t told close family members. At the end of the interview I circle back, to ask if she’s OK with it all being in print. Smith answers: “Maybe it’s age. But you start to think, if you own something, how can that hurt? If anything, I should be more honest, because if it helps other people, hearing this, that’s a good thing.”Sheridan Smith was born to showpeople, Colin and Marilyn, who toured as a musical duo on the pub circuit around Epworth in Lincolnshire. Smith’s dad was a well-known local character, a self-taught guitarist who used to joke he found “little Shezzy” – younger sibling to two older boys – “out back by the bins”. When Shezzy showed promise as a performer herself, Marilyn started taking her to talent competitions. “Mum always taught me: Eyes and teeth. Put on a big showbiz smile. And I remember my dad saying to me once, after a competition, ‘Are you sure you’re enjoying this, love?’ I said: ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah.’ He was always the more chilled one.”In her teens, Smith got a place at the National Youth Music Theatre, starring as Tallulah in a production of Bugsy Malone that transferred to the West End. She was 16, got quickly on the books of an agent and appeared at the Sam Mendes-run Donmar Warehouse, in Sondheim’s Into The Woods. There were fleeting telly gigs, in Heartbeat and Holby City, before more substantial roles in the BBC comedies The Royle Family and Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps. In 2009, Smith debuted in a stage adaptation of Legally Blonde, playing the Californian sorority-girl-turned-lawyer made famous by Reese Witherspoon. Smith remembers some scepticism about her casting in a big West End musical. “‘That bird from Two Pints? She’s gonna try and sing and dance a bit, is she?’ I was ready for a kicking.”When Legally Blonde opened, the ’s Michael Billington was among the critics who wrote it up as a name-making moment. She remembers feeling excited by the buzz, but also that “everything was more nerve-racking when I felt like I had something to lose”. She was in Legally Blonde, matinees and evenings, for almost two years, folding in useful TV work on Gavin \u0026amp Stacey and other shows along the way. “I’d be filming in the day, getting a taxi back for the performance. I had my mum’s words ringing in my head: ‘Take every job! Always be grateful!’ I never got rid of that mentality.”She can pinpoint the exact moment when everything started going wrong. It was 2011. She had only a handful of performances left before her run on Legally Blonde would end, and in the back of Smith’s mind was the nagging question: “Shit, what next?” By then she’d done the whole show maybe 600 times. “I’m on autopilot. And then, suddenly – I felt like I was going slightly mad – I just forgot a line. It had gone, I couldn’t find it. This had never happened to me before. And all the girls on stage are giggling. The orchestra’s vamping to cover it: ‘Dah! Dah! Dah!’ I remember I stayed in an American accent and said: ‘Oh my God, I forgot my line.’ And the place erupted. There was a round of applause. It should have been funny. Some actors would have brushed it off, but it really freaked me out. My head started playing these tricks.”That night she totally lost her nerve. “Every other line, I was stuttering, fluffing it. At the interval I had a panic attack. Couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t hear. They were trying to calm me down, meanwhile getting the understudy ready. Someone said, ‘Listen. If you don’t go back out there now, you might not again.’ And I’ve been told that by older actors, that they once got stage fright and couldn’t go back on stage for years and years.” She finished the show and told herself it was a one-off. “A blip. But as I was walking through the stage door the next night, all the same things started happening, the breathing, the hearing – complete panic attack.”She was still saying yes to work (Take every job! Always be grateful!), including a raved-about Trevor Nunn production of Flare Path, and the ITV drama Mrs Biggs that won her the Bafta. All along, she says, “I felt like a duck. Floating along fine but kicking like mad underneath. I know that sounds dramatic now. But the anxiety absolutely spiralled out of control.”She tells the next part of her story slowly. “I went to visit various different people. I got one diagnosis, from the first doctor I went to, that it was bipolar. I was put on medication for a year. And then I got a second opinion. This doctor said no, it’s not bipolar, you’ve got generalised anxiety. And he put me on anti-anxiety tablets. Which became a nightmare, because I needed more and more and more.“Some medications made me worse, some made me better. But the thing is, see, when you go on these medications, you’ve then got to wean yourself off them for ages. It’s a really time-consuming process of finding the right diagnosis, finding the right medication. It’s a weird one, diagnosing mental illness. Because you can’t see it.”In industry terms it was a big deal when Smith, in 2015, was cast as the lead in a London revival of Funny Girl. Her part, as the titular funny girl Fanny Brice, had once propelled Barbra Streisand off Broadway and into Hollywood. Again the early reviews were unqualified raves. As for Smith, her principle memory of that opening week was the startling effect the production had on her father. “He came to opening night. And in the second half Fanny has this big breakdown. The last 10 minutes are just me sobbing. He was sat so close to the front, and my dad – I’d never seen him cry – he couldn’t stop. He told me afterwards: ‘I love you, Shezzy. But I can never watch that show again.’ That was just before he got his cancer diagnosis.”It was when Funny Girl transferred to the West End, Smith recalls, that her father was due some important hospital results. Doctors feared his cancer might be terminal, and Smith returned to Lincolnshire to join him on a visit to the hospital. “The way the nurses were looking at us, I could tell something was going on. Afterwards he got in the car, dead quiet. Nothing was spoken about it on the way home.” This all brought back painful memories. When she was eight, her older brother Julian had been diagnosed with terminal cancer she used to rub his feet while he lay on the sofa at home. “And then one day he wasn’t there. We were very… I don’t know if this is a northern thing, but after we lost Julian we got on with things, sort of brushed our feelings under the carpet.”After she found out her father did not have long to live either, Smith says, “I just fell apart. I didn’t want to leave him, I didn’t want to be away from him. I didn’t know how to handle all those feelings. I don’t know whether, with my brother, I’d been holding things in till then. I just lost my mind for a time there.”By now Funny Girl was a sellout, largely on the back of the reviews for Smith’s performance. “I wasn’t in a job where I could say: ‘Can I take the time off? To spend it with my dad?’” Why not, I ask her? Just about any other profession would make such an allowance. “You just can’t,” Smith answers. “Not in our industry. People had bought tickets. My mum had drilled into me: the show must go on. You just can’t.”Looking back, she acknowledges, her drinking became more of a problem in this period. “I was running away from a lot, straight to the bottom of a bottle. I was trying to get out of my own head.” In March 2016, Smith missed a run of Funny Girl performances, while producers rushed out apologetic statements. (“Sheridan’s primary concern is quite rightly her father’s wellbeing… We would never ask nor expect an artist to perform in this situation.”) When she returned, there was a performance that had to be abandoned because of what the audience was told were “technical difficulties”. Smith has always denied she was drunk on stage that night, though this didn’t stop a joke about the incident being told at her expense at the Bafta awards that May. Smith was among the guests in the audience when the host, Graham Norton, said: “We’re all excited for a couple of drinks tonight. Or, as it’s known in theatrical circles, a few glasses of technical difficulties.”Smith has to hold herself back from crying when I bring this up. She tells me her immediate reaction, on the night, was a kind of pity – for the people sitting around her, who didn’t know whether to laugh or not. Then the shame kicked in. “That’s when I did all those stupid things, like Twitter, and… y’know, I just made bad decisions.” After the Baftas, Smith posted tweets that, she acknowledges, were the result of too much wine. She had a go at the press (“Fuck off! Now slag me off papers”), at disappointed audience members, at online trolls (“Sat behind your computer u little geek. Come say your shit to my face \u0026amp let’s see what happens”). Then her social media accounts went silent.Smith took a two-month hiatus from Funny Girl and kept her head down, returning to Lincolnshire to be with her dad during his final weeks. “I’m proud of that, that I was able to get myself back together to be there. Sponge his mouth. Be by his side. He knew.”There’s a piquant moment in Funny Girl when Smith’s character abruptly realises the audiences who once adored her have started to turn. When I mention this, Smith immediately recites the relevant lines. “Nobody’s clapping, nobody’s on their feet… They laughed out loud before, but that joke just ain’t that funny any more.” She laughs and says, “She’s become a joke. That did kind of happen to me. But a lot of it was my own fault, I was all over the place, part of me thinks I deserved it, the backlash. And at the same time – I think I would have rather chosen to do all that painful messy stuff in private.”When Smith launched her singing tour last spring, she says she was surprised anybody bothered to buy a ticket. The shows were often sold out, but even so, when she performed, her tendency was to self-deprecate. In the chatty interludes between songs she goofed about, messed up her hair, made in-jokes about being drunk on stage. Some commentators missed the gag here, about which Smith rolls her eyes. “The articles being written were, like, ‘She was burping, she was trashed.’ It’s part of the act! A lot of these were my dad’s jokes. The burping. The pretending your water is vodka. Simple jokes, but so funny.”Has she given up drinking? Smith says: “I’m happier not having a drink.” But no, she hasn’t given up alcohol entirely. “I don’t feel like there’s a label on it: ‘I will never touch another drop.’ I think now I’ve got my other issues under better control, I’m not needing to mask something. A lot of mental health issues can go hand-in-hand with addictions to other things. Until you get the right treatment, you’re constantly covering something up – you don’t know what you’re running away from.” In the last year or so, she’s found a treatment that works for her. “I’m in a good place. My anxiety’s down, my sociophobia’s down, all those things that I used to get myself into a state over – now that’s gone, I haven’t got that need any more.” She means the need for drink.Another seam of self-effacing humour Smith used during her music tour related to her love life. Over the years she has had a few well-known boyfriends, including James Corden, and as none of these tabloid-covered relationships ever lasted, Smith made a habit of describing her present engagement as a doomed thing. “Oh, did I not tell you? I’ve got a fella,” she said one night during a show in Cardiff. “I know you lot think it won’t last – and it probably won’t.” The audience hooted.Actually, Smith tells me, she and her fiance feel quite settled. Jamie Horn is not famous. He has a steady job in the City. He just took her on holiday in a camper van. “Yeah, over the years I kissed a lot of toads,” she says, before adding: “I shouldn’t say toads. Let’s say frogs, I kissed a lot of frogs, really, really handsome frogs. But I guess I wasn’t in the right place to give anything. I didn’t even love myself, so I wasn’t able to love anyone properly. They were always toxic, these relationships, because of drinking or whatever. You tend to attract what you’re being, so when I was out partying, it was always other party animals. Never gonna be good. But Jamie, he’s really together.” Smith reaches out to touch my arm. Then she clenches her fist and mouths: “Engaged! Come on!”He arrives to collect her from the restaurant, Horn – a courtly dude in an overcoat and flat cap who bends down to leash Trevor while Smith gathers her things. It’s a sweet domestic scene. The other night, Smith tells me, the pair of them sat down in front of the telly to watch that old episode of Who Do You Think You Are? Horn was curious to see it. Smith, nervous, agreed. And actually she didn’t find it so bad. She could consider that question, who do you think you are, and finally feel a little closer to an answer.• Cleaning Up will be on ITV in the new year.

Each toy comes with a certificate of origin.” After taking time out due to postnatal depression, she is looking forward to getting her new toys on eBay. “I want to create products that make people say: ‘I love the ethos behind that brand.’ And it’d be great to hear my little boy say: ‘My Mum did that.’”Mentors Adam and Sinead MurphyCatalina Hoyos Loarer and Ildut Loarer – Pap Yay (paper puzzle block toy)A play on “papier”, Pap Yay was born out of a shared love of design and a desire to find an alternative to the plastic tat touted to new parents. “We wanted to create a beautiful product parents didn’t have to hide,” France-born Loarer explains. “That also leaves space for the imagination, challenging children of different ages.” Boosting their savings with a Kickstarter campaign, the couple currently work out of their Hackney flat.

When it comes to a five-year plan, the pair are dreaming big. “We want to be a one-stop sleep shop,” says Paris. “We’d like to add bed linen, and be sold in any sector where sleep is important. To have a mentor’s input to help us will be invaluable.”Mentors Clare Haines and Melissa BurtonMichele Duplessis and Shannon Teague – Pop ’n Sprinkle (sprinkle-on popcorn flavours)The motivation for Duplessis’ and Teague’s business is simple: “We’re obsessed with popcorn.” Moving to London from South Africa, the friends were confused to find just two flavours on offer at the cinema. “In South Africa, you have at least five sprinkle-on flavours,” says Duplessis. Spotting an opportunity, they worked with a manufacturer to develop six flavours, which they’ve been selling online. The next challenge is to build brand awareness and take Pop ’n Sprinkle into the retail market.Mentors Claire Haines and Melissa BurtonEd Spurr – Acorn vases (green gifts)Allowing customers to grow elegant living oak trees from acorns at home, art dealer Spurr’s self-designed glass vases stem from a combined love of beautiful things and nature. First conceived as gifts for his artists, Spurr feels the vases will have wide appeal. “They’ll be interesting to design enthusiasts, tree lovers, botanists, horticulturists and also families with children,” he says. “I think it’s wonderful that from this piece of wood you can grow a tree that’ll become 500 years old.” With the support of eBay he wants to spread his message worldwide. “I’d love people to use social media to share the beautiful trees they’ve grown and start a conversation, one country to another.”Mentor Joanna DaiCatherine White – Sweet Chestnut Designs (Celtic‑inspired head jewellery)After working in the City and a stint as a truck driver, White longed for a more creative job. Studying silversmithing at Glasgow School of Art, she’d already had success selling “sparkly tiaras” but wanted to try something new. She came up with a Celtic bridal circlet, which a friend convinced her to put on eBay. “It sold straightaway,” says White. “That was 2012, and they haven’t stopped selling.” White is now looking for support with packaging and shipping. “I’d like to expand more into America,” she says.Mentor Joanna DaiLindsey Fairbairn – Ledro Design (inidually designed decals)Teaching assistant Fairbairn started her wall sticker business from her home in Chichester. “I was looking for something creative,” she says. “My degree is in design, and I love to craft things, so I came naturally to the idea.” Often personalised, her vinyl illustrations were an instant hit online. She hopes the scheme will help her find the support to scale the business. “I want to employ someone to manage the customer side of it, so I can concentrate on creating more products that’s where my passion lies.”Mentor Gabi CoxLuke Damian-Grint – Bone Shades (Bone-conducting smart sunglasses)Damian-Grint’s innovative glasses use Bluetooth technology to link your phone to a bone-conducting speaker, so users can take calls and use voice-command via vibrations through their skulls to the inner ear. Some similar products are sold in the US, but Bone Shades are unusual in that they run on Google systems, so the tech is always updating. Damian-Grint has started taking pre-orders and, with the scheme’s support, he eventually wants to expand into other products. “I’d like to build it into a technology fashion brand sold in major retailers globally.”Mentor Walter GleesonEmma Orr – Ambassadors of Science (slime kits and science experiments)Looking for a new way to engage her students, Orr decided to shake up her lessons. “I started running science workshops,” she says, “and created a slime kit.” These proved so popular she took the kits online, developing equipment for basic science experiments. Now, Orr has given up her teaching job to pursue her passion full-time. “All my time is spent on this,” she says. Orr hopes the scheme will help her expand as she develops a Halloween box and preps for the Christmas slime rush.Mentor Walter GleesonSimon Basil – Built by Basil (artisan gear knobs from recycled skateboards)Car gear knobs made from old skateboards might not sound like an obvious idea, but it’s certainly a popular one. A fan of Reddit, Basil shared a video of himself making the accessory on the site and, to his shock, it gained more than 400,000 views in a matter of hours. The orders soon started rolling in. “I sell to people who like customising their cars, which is a massive market,” says the former engineer from Lymington, but he’d love some support. “You can’t beat speaking to someone face to face and fleshing out a problem.”Mentors Mo Bro’sDavid Long – Babouche Golf (handmade personalised golf head covers)A trip to Marrakech inspired Long to create his range of golfing accessories. After commissioning a leather maker in the souks to produce a cover for him, he brought it back to his home course. “Everyone loved that it was nothing like the branded covers on the market,” he says. He now stocks 22 styles and sees eBay as the ideal platform for scaling up. “The scheme has given me the impetus to give this everything, because it’s not a side hustle, it’s my future.”Mentors Mo Bro’sEach of our Doers has been paired with an expert entrepreneur to offer advice and guide them through the scheme.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Increasing numbers of British parents don’t think soEvery morning Ben Mumford starts his school day with maths. At the age of 10 he is already working at GCSE level, but he doesn’t always bother to get out of his pyjamas in time for the class. He reads more books than most of his friends, studies science on the beach, and recently built a go-kart in a technology lesson. Ben is happy and fulfilled. All, his mother Claire Mumford believes, thanks to home-schooling. “It’s not that I’m anti-establishment,” says Mumford, who has been home-schooling Ben and her other children, Sam, 11, and Amelia, eight, for the last year. “It’s just that schools haven’t got the time to nurture and teach children the way I think they should. School is very oppressive for young people. It’s not natural to be sat at a desk all day, with fluorescent lights, computer screens, barely able to see outside.” Her children get “time to relax and to be kids – to go to the woods, build dens and to learn what they’re excited about.”Mumford, 40, a community volunteer, was born on the Isle of Wight, where her father had taken early retirement as an army captain following an accident, and her mother was a former teacher. She moved back about eight years ago, when she separated from the children’s father, a chauffeur.She describes her style of home-education as “child-led”. The only formal lesson is maths, where the children work from books for half an hour every morning. “Then we see what we want to do that day,” she says. Lessons can take place in the library or the woods rather than learning science, they “experience it” by growing plants, say, or by digging water channels on the beach. Structured weekly activities include youth club home-ed drama group talks by the police, air ambulance or the coastguard organised by Rookley Home-Ed Meet, a group on the island made up of around 20 families and football training with Southampton FC on the mainland.Amelia also does work experience in a hardware shop in her village, and has widened her social group to include sixtysomethings and a variety of dogs. She is also learning the Latin names of flowers. “The job has been amazing for her confidence,” says Mumford.Sam likes “designing stuff” such as underwater cities, produces a weekly local newspaper, St Catherine’s Chronicle, and re-enacts battles with his toy soldiers. Ben is currently interested in footballers’ autobiographies, nutritional tips for athletes and teach-yourself guides on how to be a premier league player. Amelia studies fashion books and magazines, writes songs and paints pebbles.“The best thing is you get to be free and you don’t feel squashed up,” says Ben. “At school people have to sit inside at a table and you might not learn anything new,” adds Amelia. “At home you can choose your subjects and you can go outside and see your friends more.” The only downside for Sam is that he is “a bit cleverer than Mum”. True, says Mumford. “I don’t know what he’s talking about half the time.”Many parents who opt to home-school their children say they are avoiding bullying, exam pressure and stress. Others have concerns about special educational needs, not getting a place at the school of their choice, or the school environment. “It used to be a philosophical ethos now it’s about children having some sort of difficulty at school,” says Edwina Theunissen, former trustee of Education Otherwise, a home-education charity founded in 1977.Helen Lees, visiting research fellow at York St John University, and a specialist in alternative education, believes the increase suggests “something quite worrying about the state of the education system. I’m not sure having 30 children in a classroom all doing the same thing works any more. Not with the way the classroom is structured, and the way the curriculum is followed.”Changes in technology have made it easier to teach out of the classroom, and methods range from the traditional approach of textbooks, study schedules, grades and tests to “unschooling” or “autonomous education”, a philosophy conceived by the US author and educator John Holt in the 1970s. He believed that if you give a child the freedom to follow their own interests, and a rich assortment of resources, they will do the actual learning themselves.Some parents do the teaching others subcontract it to experts – club leaders, online schools, tutors. This is not cheap. The cost can be up to £34,000 a year, according to Stephen Spriggs, head of education at William Clarence, a tutoring company that offers a 30-hour-a-week home-education programme.There are families that dip into home-education for short periods – to get into competitive secondary schools, or retake A-levels, for example. For others it is not just an interlude it’s their lives.Mumford says none of her children were happy at school, adding: “I should have done it before.” Sam, Ben and Amelia went to a local primary, where Sam, in particular, struggled to fit in. “Our house used to overlook the playground and I could see the only person Sam talked to was the dinner lady,” says Mumford. As well as having difficulty with friendships, Sam is very rigid in his thinking: “If the school lunch was five minutes late and no one told him why, he’d get very frustrated,” says his mother. He also has obsessive interests, such as the Romans and Norse mythology. Mumford suspected autism, but it would be four years before it was confirmed, when he was eight. There are lengthy delays on the island owing to the lack of a diagnostic service.When Sam was eight, Mumford decided to teach him at home for a while. “He was very well behaved at school, but he’d bottle it up and he’d come home and explode. He’d be violent and horrendous,” she says. Home-schooling “was really good for his confidence because he realised it was OK to be different”. After six months, he decided to go back to school. “It was the summer term and there was fun stuff like sports day,” Mumford says.In September 2017, all three children started the new school year at the same school. But by the end of October, Mumford had pulled them all out. She says that Sam was bored. “He is very clever. If they were learning this much about the Romans, he already knew this much.” She holds her hands out wide. It was painfully clear to Ben and Amelia, meanwhile, that they weren’t performing well enough for the school. “Schools want to get good Ofsted results. The councils wants their schools to get good Ofsted results. The system is about trying to please the people at the top, rather than help children,” says Mumford.The Isle of Wight has the highest proportion of home-educated children in the UK, at almost one in 50. Isle of Wight Council attributes the high levels in part to under-reporting elsewhere in the country. But its education system has been heavily criticised. In 2017, 10 out of 55 schools and colleges required improvement, and one was “inadequate”, according to Ofsted, although the council says it is tackling “lower educational standards”. “Accountability systems” – Ofsted inspections, government tables and targets – have created a “culture of fear” in schools, according to a recent report (pdf) by the National Association of Head Teachers union. It highlights the pressure on headteachers to get good results on pain of being forced out, and how the emphasis on test results has narrowed the curriculum and made “drilling” for key stage 2 Sats common. Children take the test when they’re around 11 and are prepared with revision classes and practice tests, sometimes even during the Easter holidays.When Amelia was seven, “the teachers suddenly put a lot more emphasis on spelling,” says Mumford. (The national curriculum introduced in 2014 saw a shift in focus from the creative to the technical side of writing.) “She had to spell every word correctly and write all the letters around the right way that meant she could only do two sentences, whereas before she was writing pages. She’d come home crying. She was asking for extra spelling work it was all she ever worried about.” Ben, too, was feeling crushed by the emphasis on results. “He was doing well, but every time someone did better in a test he felt he was a failure. I do understand it’s a fact of life: some people are going to be cleverer than you. But it’s almost like children spend all day permanently being judged.” Children, she continues, should be assessed as iniduals rather than “where are they are in comparison with 29 others”. Ben became anxious. “He didn’t want to go to school, he’d have a tummy ache, he’d feel sick.”Mumford was herself taught at home for a year after her family moved to rural Cornwall when she was eight. “I did very limited work and yet when I went back to school I was put in the top sets. It didn’t hold me back, so I wasn’t worried about them falling behind.” But she acknowledges that home-schooling is a financial strain. “I can’t work while I’m home-schooling so I have to rely on benefits, and I don’t like that,” says Mumford. “That’s partly why I do so much voluntary work: I feel like I’m giving something back.” Families have to pay for all exams English GCSE, for example, usually costs around £50, and many exam centres also ask for an administrative fee.“Because we don’t have much money, there are things the children miss out on. Amelia would love to go horse riding. Ben would like to do more sports. We don’t go on holiday, and just occasionally I could do with half an hour to myself,” she says. While she doesn’t lack support because of the island’s large home-educating community, spending so much time together can occasionally be too much. “Sometimes I have to go up to my room to calm down, so I am not shouting at them. I don’t like shouting. Unless something extreme happens, like someone gets injured, I am ‘do not disturb’ for a bit of time.”Critics argue that the “cocooning” desire of some home-schooling parents is fuelled by a romanticised vision of the past. “It is not just about seeking an escape from the problems of the ‘city’ (a metaphor for danger and heterogeneity), it is a rejection of the entire idea of a city. Cultural and intellectual ersity, complexity, ambiguity, uncertainty and proximity to ‘the Other,” writes educational theorist Michael Apple in Away With All Teachers: The Cultural Politics Of Home Schooling. He likens home-schooling to a “gated community”, mirroring the filter bubbles that have been created by the internet. “Even with evident shortcomings,” he says, schools “provide a kind of ‘social glue’, a common cultural reference point in our polyglot, increasingly multicultural society.”There is criticism, too, from within the community. “The most popular educational method used by those who withdraw their children from school is autonomous education and involves nobody teaching children anything at all,” says Simon Webb, author of Elective Home Education In The UK. “Children’s interests often involve lying in bed until very late, then getting up and watching cartoons on television and eating nothing but sugary snacks. Children aren’t the best judge of what to learn or what lifestyle to adopt.”Webb, who is married to a social worker, home-educated his daughter, Simone, “from birth to 16”. After passing four A-levels at A* at college, she went to Oxford University, and gained a first in philosophy, politics and economics. Now 25, she is doing a PhD and teaches at University College London and King’s College London. “If you do ‘unschooling’, if you don’t get your children to take GCSEs, you are really handicapping them,” he says.Esmé Biggar, 17, lives near Kelso in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland, with her mother, Eula Wilkin, 53, an administrator. Her parents separated soon after she was born she only occasionally sees her father.“For some people school is really good, and it works for them because they learn in the way that school teaches,” says Biggar. “But there are so many different ways of learning and processing information and knowledge. It doesn’t work for everyone. And it didn’t work for me.”She started at her local primary when she was four and left when she was eight. By then, her mother was horrified by the change in her. “From being self-motivated and able to read and write, and very focused, she came out angry, distressed and completely phobic of any formal type of education,” says Wilkin. Biggar thinks in retrospect she wasn’t suited to school. She’s never had a formal diagnosis but she believes she has Asperger’s. “We had a massive class, like 30 people, and it was really noisy and stressful. I didn’t feel I could cope with the amount of people or the way I was being taught.”Her mother says Biggar was excruciatingly shy and the trauma of school went very deep. She recalls her wetting herself most days. “She’d been dry since the age of 18 months.”A decade on, Biggar is happy and confident. She is doing online A-levels in English literature, classical civilisation and philosophy, and a Scottish higher in drama through a local school. She is passionate about theatre – performing, writing, directing. She’s appeared in three professional performances, and at the Edinburgh festival fringe. “It would have been a lot harder if I’d been at school. A lot of the rehearsals are during the day.” Her ambition is to study drama at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. “Drama is the focus of her life, so that is the route we’ve followed,” says her mother. “You visit every attraction, every festival, every educational opportunity that comes along.”There has been a price to pay. “I’m still single!” Wilkin says. “I’ve never had a partner through any of this. I haven’t had the opportunity to meet anybody as I’m so busy getting Esmé here, there and everywhere. But it has enriched my life massively.” Families in the UK have long welcomed the relaxed laws governing home-education. While home-education is illegal in, for example, Germany, Croatia, Brazil and Turkey, the only requirement for a parent in England wishing to withdraw a child from school is to send a written request to the “proprietor” of the school (typically the headteacher) they must accept if you are taking your child out completely, but can refuse if you want to send your child to school some of the time. (The process of “deregistering” is slightly different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.) If a child has never been to school, you don’t need to tell anyone.Under section seven of the Education Act of 1996, parents have a duty to ensure their children are educated. And that’s about it. They are not required to teach the national curriculum, have any specific qualifications, register with a local authority, allow inspectors into their homes, or get approval for the sort of education provided at home. (Welsh guidelines recommend the local authority contacts the family annually.)But the government is now seeking to tighten and clarify rules surrounding home-education. Proposals include a mandatory register of home-educated children, along with increased monitoring and support from local authorities.This is prompted in part by the steep rise in the number of children educated at home, and by concerns over child welfare in the wake of such high-profile cases as that of Jordan Burling, from Leeds, who died after severe neglect in 2016. Jordan, 18, had not attended school since he was 12, when his mother announced he was to be home-schooled. He never took any exams or achieved any qualifications and was rarely seen outside the house.The growing number of illegal schools – unregistered establishments that operate outside the supervision of the Department for Education, local authorities or Ofsted inspection framework, and are often religious in character – is another worry. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools, warned they posed a threat to “British values” and gave the impression that home-schooling was being used as a cover for terrorism. “I have previously voiced concern that many of those operating unregistered schools are unscrupulously using the freedoms that parents have to home-educate their children as a cover for their activities,” he wrote in a letter to Nicky Morgan, the then secretary of state for education in May 2016. Ofsted inspectors had previously uncovered 100 suspected illegal schools in England, including some with a narrow, Islam-focused curriculum. In a separate move, the government wants to fine schools found to be “off-rolling” – a process where the parents of challenging children are persuaded to home-educate, most commonly in year 11, prior to doing their GCSE exams. The home-schooling community has reacted angrily to the unprecedented focus on its activities, claiming government proposals “infringe parental rights” and fuel “unwarranted suspicion”. “The government doesn’t want to admit the reason that home-education numbers are rising is not to do with radicalisation,” says Chris McGovern, a retired headteacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education. “That is a concern, but it is a far greater problem in state schools than in home-schooling. It’s because schools are failing ever greater numbers of children.”Rita Ball, 40, an educational entrepreneur, and her husband Anirban Nandi, 42, an accountant, have been home-educating their two children, Ilora, 10, and Elam, eight, for the last five years. “Before, I had the impression that home-schooling was for fundamentalist weird people in the midwest,” says Nandi. “Normal people didn’t do it.” He admits the couple weren’t obvious candidates for alternative education. They both enjoyed school and got good grades: Nandi at a state primary, and then an independent day school in south London Ball at a primary in Zambia, where her doctor mother worked in a hospital for the mining community, and then at James Allen’s Girls’ School, an independent school in Dulwich, south London.When Ball told her parents she was taking Ilora out of school, “they thought I’d lost the plot, like borderline child neglect, if not actual child neglect.” Both families are from West Bengal in India, and emigrated to England in the early 70s. “Their only priority was education,” says Ball. In rural India, Ball’s father “walked two miles through tiger-filled forest to get to a school. If you didn’t go to school you would be stuck in poverty for ever. Everything they worked hard for, their country has worked hard for, is to get children to school.”Ball and Nandi had a place for Ilora at a good local primary. “I thought, ‘Job done’,” says Nandi. What’s more, they say Ilora would have thrived there. “She really enjoyed nursery. She loved interacting with other kids. She was very popular with the teachers. She was diligent,” says Nandi.When Ilora was four, however, Ball sat down with her laptop to download the school application form. “I was like, ‘What? Kids go from nine until 3.30 every day? Four-year-olds spending all that time in a classroom? Not outdoors, but indoors?’ And there were all these rules. ‘If you don’t send your child to school you’ll be done for truancy.’ I was just, ‘Whoa, this doesn’t sit right with me.’ And then slowly, slowly, other alternatives opened up.”First they tried “flexi-schooling”, with Ilora attending school four days a week and learning at home on Fridays (now only allowed in “very exceptional circumstances,” according to the Department for Education). The following year, Ilora went full-time, but left at half-term. “I knew I would miss the lunch – I used to have chicken and chips and beans, with apple crumble, or peaches and syrup – playtime and friends, but I liked staying at home a lot.” She has been home-schooled ever since. Elam has never been to school.Ball was set on an academic career before an accident in her early 20s “shook things up” and made her question the value of finishing her PhD in water pollution in Bengal. She went on to manage a bookshop that specialised in mind, body and soul for 15 years and now runs Roots2Grow, an initiative to make mathematics more accessible. She places high value on “freedom”.“For me, home-education is every sort of freedom,” she says. “Freedom for the children – to be bored, stimulated, to self-motivate freedom as a family. When Ilora was at school she would come home and it would be bathtime, dinner time, no relaxed time. It just seemed like you wake up and it’s basically a race to put them back to bed again. And freedom of thought.” She believes league tables and budget cuts have stifled creativity and critical thinking in schools. “Everyone’s just going through the motions.”Nandi admits he was worried about the children drifting in academic backwaters. “But actually, if you do the maths, an adultchild ratio of one to one, or one to two or five, compared with one to 30, well, it’s going to be better, isn’t it?” Isolation was a concern, but he says the home-education community has grown so much this isn’t a problem. Their local South London Home Education group has 3,000 members.“I got more and more confident that home-education was not only not the wrong thing to do, but a positively good thing to do,” says Nandi. He’s aware, however, that he honed key survival skills in the playground. “It’s lack of bullying I’m worrying about.”Nandi and Ball operate a shift system. When Ball is at work, Nandi, who is self-employed, is in charge, and vice versa. They combine structured classes with free time for the children to read, draw, play card and board games, watch films and amuse themselves. On Monday mornings, for example, Nandi takes the children to Sutton Home Education Forum, where they do football, gymnastics and multi-sports. On Tuesday mornings they go to the Forest School in Streatham and learn to do such things as build fires, whittle wood or just “appreciate nature”.Elam does classes in capoeira, a Brazilian martial art Ilora does kung fu, performing arts and Scouts. They both go swimming, and to a maths group (run by their mother and her business partner) and learn about science with an informal group of two families. llora has an English tutor for an hour twice a week – partly to placate her grandparents. “It keeps them calmer,” says Nandi.It is expensive, they agree: £100 a week on the tutor clubs at around £100 a term. “Day trips can cost a lot, even if you’re subsidised as an educational workshop,” says Ball. “A state school offers a wide social mix, whereas home education is limited to those who can afford it, whether they are doing it cheaply or not. On the other hand, I do feel they’re exposed a lot more to children with special educational needs, children with disabilities, than they would be at school, and in a very relaxed way.”The plan is for the children to sit GCSEs and A-levels, then ideally do a degree.But aren’t you only showing the children what interests you, I ask. Nandi disagrees. “I spent my life avoiding Bengali dancing and singing performances but Ilora loves it so I’m taking her to those.”“They are spending a lot of time in our company,” Ball admits. “Yes, they have friends, meet other adults, all of that, but there is this massive influence of us in their life. And that is positive and potentially negative. The parentchild dynamic is not broken up enough. It’s a relationship that needs a lot of space. But I don’t see the space that school gives children as the healthier option.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7c97a81b2e77822f8ec317f96337c8f614df26/1_0_2720_1632/master/2720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa294c4f6bb7ab9b59c43073b9cfb7b","title":"what to see in amsterdam the design lovers guide","story":"Quirky-cool Amsterdam has long been a draw for the creative crowd but now, thanks to the direct Eurostar service from London, it’s closer than ever. Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

But when cooked, what normally makes blue cheese so isive is harnessed to add a complexity that isn’t about the cheese itself, but about giving the other components extra depth. The sweetness of slow-cooked red cabbage, the earthy creaminess of potato cakes and the grassy notes of chard pie are all improved by the power of a little modest mould.The dough is the star here: buttery, flaky and easy to put together. Use a stronger blue cheese, such as roquefort, if you prefer. The sweet raisins are fantastic with the savoury chard and cheese, but you can also leave them out.10g unsalted butter2½ tbsp olive oil1 large onion (200g), thinly sliced250g Swiss chard, stems chopped into 1cm cubes, leaves roughly shredded3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushedSalt and pepper10g parsley leaves, roughly chopped30g golden raisins, soaked in 100ml hot water for 20 minutes, then drained20g pine nuts¾ tsp sumac45g ricotta 100g dolcelatte, roughly crumbled 1 egg, beatenFor the crust80g plain flour35g wholemeal flour½ tbsp sugar½ tsp flaked sea salt½ tsp dried oregano½ tsp dried thyme115g unsalted fridge-cold butter, cut into 1½cm cubes60ml ice-cold waterHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Melt the butter and a tablespoon of oil in a large saute pan on a medium heat, then fry the onion, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, until it’s completely softened and deeply caramelised. Set aside.While the onions are cooking, heat the remaining tablespoon and a half of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high flame. Once hot, fry the chard stems for five minutes, until softened, then add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Add the chard leaves, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and cook for three minutes, until the chard has wilted and released some of its liquid. Transfer to a sieve set over a bowl, gently squeeze out any excess moisture, then put in a bowl and mix in the parsley, raisins, pine nuts, half a teaspoon of sumac and the caramelised onions, and leave to cool.Make the crust by whisking both the flours in a large bowl with the sugar, salt and herbs. Add the butter and incorporate it into the flour by squashing each cube between your fingers. Don’t overwork the butter – you want chunks throughout the dough – so a light squish will do. Add the water and use your hands to gather the dough together into a shaggy mess – it will be quite wet.Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and roll out into a rectangle about 28cm x 18cm. Fold the longer ends in towards each other, so they meet in the centre, then roll over once with a rolling pin. Fold in the shorter ends in the same way, roll out once again, then fold in half, so you’re left with a square. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 20 minutes.On a well-floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a 28cm-diameter disc, then carefully lift on to an oven tray lined with baking paper. Spread the ricotta all over the dough, leaving a 1cm rim all around the outside edge, then cover with half the blue cheese. Top with the chard filling and the remaining blue cheese.Use a knife to make small, 2cm cuts about 8cm apart all around the circumference of the galette. Take one of the resulting dough strips and fold it inwards towards the centre. Repeat with the next strip, pulling gently so it overlaps slightly with the previous one and seals the previous fold. Repeat with all the strips all around the edge of the galette, then refrigerate for 30 minutes. Brush the edges with egg wash and sprinkle with the remaining sumac.Bake for 25 minutes, until golden and cooked through, then leave to cool and rest for 15 minutes before serving warm.Serve the cakes as they are, drizzled with lemon juice, or with fried eggs, smoked salmon or grilled bacon. If you can’t get hold of dried Iranian lime, use a teaspoon of lime zest, or just leave it out altogether.2 large potatoes (900g)60ml olive oil3-4 leeks (400g), trimmed and finely sliced½ tsp ground dried Iranian lime1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and roughly crushed10g tarragon, roughly chopped15g mint leaves, roughly chopped1 small preserved lemon (15g), skin finely chopped1 tsp finely grated lemon zestSalt and black pepper100g stilton, roughly crumbledHeat the oven to 220C425Fgas 7. Put the potatoes on a baking tray and bake for 45-60 minutes, until the flesh is soft. Remove from the oven and, once cool enough to handle, cut in half, scoop out the flesh – you should have about 600g – put in a large bowl and roughly mash. Discard the skins (or drizzle with olive oil and grill, to serve as a snack).Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high flame. Add the leeks and fry for seven to eight minutes, stirring frequently, until soft but still bright green. Add the leeks to the potato, along with the Iranian lime, cumin, herbs, preserved lemon, lemon zest, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper. Mix together, then form into 12 6cm-diameter x 2cm-thick cakes.Heat the grill to its highest setting. Put a large frying pan on a medium heat with a tablespoon of oil. Once hot, add six cakes and fry for about four minutes, turning once halfway, until golden brown on both sides, then transfer to a baking tray. Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and repeat with the remaining cakes. Dot the stilton on top of the cakes and put under the grill for two to three minutes, until melted and browned on top.Serve hot with a crisp fried egg alongside, if you like.This is a recent wintry addition to the menu at my new restaurant, Rovi. We bake the cabbage for hours, then grill it with cheese until everything is intensely soft and seductively unctuous.

Pour this over the cabbage wedges, so they’re well coated, then cover securely with tin foil. Bake for two and a half to three hours (depending on the size of the cabbage), basting a few times, until the cabbage is completely soft. Remove from the oven, put the wedges and cooked grapes on a plate and strain the liquid into a small saucepan – you should have 150-200ml. Reduce on a high heat for four to six minutes, stirring frequently, until you have about 50ml of thickened liquid left.Turn the grill to its highest setting and put an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Arrange the wedges and cooked grapes on a baking tray with the remaining 100g grapes and dot the gorgonzola between the cabbage wedges. Grill for six to seven minutes, until the cabbage is starting to crisp up, the grapes are scorched and the cheese has melted. If the cabbage starts to burn, turn down the grill.To serve, drizzle two teaspoons of the thickened syrup over each cabbage wedge, sprinkle over the thyme and spoon over the soured cream or serve on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6310fd6a49ca6d099a9d7f7c2f4151e1b4af20cd/0_131_2593_3239/master/2593.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d0f83c49df790bdb2f4abb281f314490 1400w","title":"arsenal liverpool premier league match report","story":"Unai Emery wants to write a new history at Arsenal. It is one of his buzz phrases and he reaches for it at every available opportunity. In terms of the club’s travails against Big Six opposition, which admittedly pre-date him by some years, this was another frustrating result. The statistics show that Arsenal have now won only three of their last 28 such fixtures. Emery had started his reign with back-to-back defeats against Manchester City and Chelsea.And yet there was plenty to like about how his team performed in a blood-and-thunder contest. They brought the passion, they created chances, mainly in the first half, and they were full value for their late equaliser, expertly finished by Alexandre Lacazette. The striker nipped on to a pass from the substitute Alex Iwobi and outfoxed Alisson, who had been lured off his line, before curling home.At full-time the home crowd applauded their players. Liverpool were annoyed, having led through James Milner. They appeared to be set fair to see the game out and would have felt they created the clearer-cut chances. On the upside, they remain unbeaten. They might have signed for the point beforehand. They would not have done in the closing stages.The tempo was breathless and the action open, and Liverpool must have wondered how they did not take the lead on 18 minutes. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross was floated beautifully and, having judged its bounce, Roberto Firmino lifted his shot over Bernd Leno and looked ready to celebrate only for the ball to rebound off the woodwork. Sadio Mané rolled the rebound in to the empty net but was flagged for offside.Mané had been in front of the last defender when Alexander-Arnold played the pass and, from a position alongside Firmino, he appeared to be influencing the play. But when Firmino took his shot, Mané was behind him and the ball – in other words, he was onside for the second phase of play. The flag had not gone up during the first phase. Why not?The near-miss fired Liverpool up and they enjoyed a purple patch in which they ought to have scored. Granit Xhaka jumped into a saving challenge on Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson drilled straight at Leno but the big chance came in between, when Virgil van Dijk tiptoed into space behind Shkodran Mustafi.Salah picked him out and van Dijk had only Leno to beat. His first touch was good but the finish was too close to the goalkeeper, who blocked. Mustafi scraped the ball away.Arsenal had been first in to their stride in what was a rollercoaster first half. They brought the intensity. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang saw a shot erted wide by Joe Gomez Xhaka did not get hold of an effort after a cute corner routine and Henrikh Mkhitaryan looped a header inches off target from an Aubameyang cross, with Alisson having committed himself and failed to get there.Arsenal pushed again after the half-hour. Mkhitaryan released Aubameyang with a flick but he could not muster sufficient power as van Dijk jumped in to challenge, while Alexandre Lacazette was put through by a Mesut Özil touch. Lining up a shot towards the far post, the striker dragged narrowly wide.The half-time whistle brought a much-needed breather. The pace had been phenomenal – an excellent advertisement for the Premier League. Liverpool might have snatched the lead moments earlier. Arsenal’s defensive line broke down on James Milner’s free-kick and when Leno left his line, he was beaten to the ball by van Dijk, whose header hit the foot of the post.Jürgen Klopp switched to 4-2-3-1 at the start of the second half, moving Milner to the right and asking Salah to play up top, with Firmino in behind. It was Milner who got forward to break the deadlock. The goal was a bad moment for Leno, who Emery had started ahead of Petr Cech. When Mané crossed low from the left, Leno’s footwork was not good enough and he stretched for the ball, pushing it out into a dangerous area. It flicked off Holding and broke for Milner, who lashed home.Arsenal played on the front foot, the full-backs, Héctor Bellerín and Sead Kolasinac, bombing forward. The impressive Lucas Torreira extended Alisson shortly after Milner’s goal but the tide had turned. Liverpool were in control and they almost extended their lead. Firmino was off target with a header from one corner van Dijk worked Leno from another. On another day, Van Dijk could have had a hat-trick.Emery gambled by sending on Danny Welbeck for Kolasinac and asking Iwobi to play left-back. Fortune would favour the brave, with Iwobi playing in Lacazette for the equaliser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9657757eff571a913c93a0720eaf5a611658c33e/0_40_4565_2739/master/4565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a453c13b8441852a41dc12b31d060349","title":"cardiff city leicester city premier league match report","story":"The final whistle had blown 10 minutes previously and Leicester’s players, drained in ways only they will be able to convey, stood in communion with the travelling supporters who had packed into the east corner. Most of those in the stand were still wearing the white shirts handed out earlier in the day, which bore Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha’s image and a message in tribute to the club’s late owner all were in full voice and, between a hymnbook-full of songs lauding heroes from recent years, one chant rang clear above them all: “Champions of England, you made us sing that.”This was always going to be a difficult day, but it ended up feeling uplifting, too. In other words, it was exactly the note everyone touched by last Saturday’s tragedy would have hoped to strike and when Demarai Gray clipped in a neatly taken winner 10 minutes after half-time the emotional celebrations left no doubt about Leicester’s appetite to give their late owner a fitting send-off.They will do that more formally over the next few days in Thailand, the majority of the squad having flown straight from Cardiff Airport to Bangkok after the game to attend Srivaddhanaprabha’s funeral, but this turned into a celebration of eight transformative years in charge: an afternoon nobody had ever wanted but one in which everyone responded to their utmost credit.“We wanted to do it for him and his family today,” said Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester goalkeeper, said. “Every single player wanted to get out there there was no pressure from anyone but everyone jumped at the chance. We’re glad we’ve come away with a win that we can take to Thailand and we hope we did his family proud.”Schmeichel embraced every one of his team-mates, holding his captain, Wes Morgan, for a telling extra few seconds, before they lined up around the centre circle for a minute’s silence before kick-off. The entire travelling staff and non-playing squad joined them to form a group of more than 40 that idea came from the players and, while the warm-ups had given a sound impression of business as usual, it presented an arresting image that struck home the extent to which Leicester’s collective has been shaken to the core.They were received beautifully by Cardiff, whose task in staging an occasion clouded by such a ghastly pall was entirely unenviable. The host club met it with grace, reverence and class. Inside the match-day programme a dedication from the Cardiff owner, Vincent Tan, the CEO, Ken Choo, and the chairman, Mehmet Dalman, described Srivaddhanaprabha as “a true pioneer and visionary‚ whose legacy will live forever”.A number of their fans gathered to applaud the Leicester squad as they arrived and the locals were generous with their acclaim, too, as they went through their drills an hour later. They joined their visitors in passing around a Thai flag banner before kick-off a bouquet was also laid in Srivaddhanaprabha’s memory and the sense was one of intense kinship, on a football level and several deeper.Neil Warnock and his players had made little mention of their own needs but would, on a normal day, have earmarked this as a game from which to take points for their relegation battle. On the pitch they showed no inclination to offer favours, dominating the first half-hour and hitting the woodwork through Victor Camarasa’s free-kick.Perhaps Leicester had needed time to clear their heads or perhaps they had to earn the right for their quality to dominate either way, they gained a foothold and should have won a penalty before half-time when Lee Probert failed to see Sol Bamba had flicked Jamie Vardy’s effort on to the bar with his hand.That did not matter. Gray settled the issue, finishing Ben Chilwell’s cross clinically, and ripped off his shirt to reveal another reading: “For Khun Vichai”. Whether Probert really had to get out the yellow card that he sheepishly held up feels like too cheap a debate for the occasion the rejoicing was prolonged and Leicester had few alarms after that.“We had to find a good balance between emotion, self-control and desire,” said Claude Puel. “It was fantastic to share this good result with our fans at the end. It was the first step forward.”More than that, it was a homage to the gigantic leaps Leicester took under a man they will give thanks to forever.

And I do not just look to my defenders, as a team we did not start pressing up, the work we did during the week. People watching this game will not believe how hard we worked this week. The first half was a disaster.”Mourinho pointed to the incident involving Chris Smalling that allowed Fraser his early chance only for David De Gea to save his effort as the trigger for United’s demise, claiming that the England defender’s mistake had “triggered instability in the team”.He added: “It looked like we don’t work tactically during the week, which obviously is the worst feeling for me because we work so much that I expect my team to be really good. I feel frustrated with that.The victory lifts United level on points with Bournemouth but they still trail Eddie Howe’s side on goal difference. Mourinho admitted that he had commiserated with his opposite number at the final whistle after an exciting game and Howe was full of praise for his players despite their disappointment at losing the game so late in the day.“It’s a tough one for us. There was a lot of intensity to our play and we created a number of chances,” he said. “The disappointment at half-time was that we weren’t winning but it was one of the best first-half performances we’ve seen since we were promoted to the Premier League.“We knew it would be a different game in the second half and full credit to them for sticking in the game. But from our perspective we’re disappointed. There was always the feeling that there was another goal in the game and unfortunately it wasn’t for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8954219703070067bd06fd8318dcb61f8b160958/0_118_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a7e8100f584da01b02dad67e400e738","title":"arsenal v liverpool premier league live","story":"Arsenal came from behind to share the spoils in a thrilling ding-dong battle at the Emirates David Hytner was our man at the Emirates and this is how he saw a thrilling game unfold. James Milner speaks: He tells BT Sport he’s disappointed with the outcome having led in the second half. He also concedes that coming away from the Emirates with a point is never a bad result, but this feels like two points dropped. He’s obviously very frustrated. We’re nearly done: We’ll have a match report from the Emirates for your reading pleasure shortly, but in the meantime you can join James Piercey for coverage of Wolves v Tottenham Hotspur, which kicks off in a few minutes.Alexandre Lacazette speaks: “Yeah the point is enough for both teams,” he tells BT Sport. “It was a good game. We worked hard so thank you to Liverpool for making it a good game.”Asked how the season is going for Arsenal: “The first big games we lost, but we knew if we worked for 12 games we could have some points and today we showed we have the quality to play bigger teams,” he says. Asked about the changes at Arsenal since Unai Emery took over, Alex Iwobi has this to say: “You can see we’re putting in an extra shift and extra work. We’re putting in the extra work in training and not just on the pitch.”He goes on to add that rumours that Emery has banned his players even from drinking fruit juice have been greatly exaggerated. How things stand: Here’s how the summit of the Premier League table looks after tonight’s game.Meanwhile, this from Matt Dony on another bone of contention: “I don’t want to disagree with Charles Antaki, but Liverpool’s own Instagram feed describes the pre-match training kit, which is the same colour as the strip, as ‘purple’,” writes Matt. No, I’m not having that. It’s African violet all the way for me, after being given the steer by Charles. A pre-match thought: While it’s difficult to know what both managers will make of the outcome of this match, one suspects Pep Guardiola will be absolutely delighted. City’s top six rivals repeatedly taking points from each other contributed in no small part to City winning the title at a canter last season and I’m fairly confident much the same thing is going to happen again this time around. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over and the points are shared at the end of a thrilling white-knuckle ride at the Emirates. James Milner opened the scoring for Liverpool after capitalising on a goalkeeping error, but Alexandre Lacazette rescued a point for his side with a wonderful finish.90+5 min: Liverpool have a throw-in deep inside their own half. They win a free-kick for a foul on Wijnaldum with just seconds remaining. 90+3 min: Mo Salah holds his head in his hands after failing to pick out a Sadio Mane dash through the centre with a threaded pass that was blocked by Holding. That was a crucial interception. Liverpool substitution: Salah off, Matip on.90+2 min: Fabinho concedes a free-kick in midfield after accidentally bringing Mesut Ozil to ground. It was a foul, but there was no malice intended and he escapes the second yellow card that would have put the tin hat on a very disappointing evening for him. 90+1 min: Mane gets a cross into the Arsenal penalty area, but it’s hacked clear. There’s a halt to the five additional minutes of added time as Lucas Torreira goes down injured. He’s been outstanding in Arsenal’s midfield today.89 min: Liverpool go in search of a winner with Milner and Salah marauding down the right. The attack breaks down when Iwobi wins the ball and sends Arsenal on their way.88 min: Hector Bellerin goes agonisingly close with a shot from the edge of the penalty area that wafts wide of the top right-hand corner. 85 min: While Lacazette’s equaliser was a fine piece of inidual skill, the build-up to it was equally mouth-watering, not unlike a couple of other splendid team goals they’ve scored this season. 83 min: Sadio Mane sends a shot fizzing over the Arsenal bar but it took a deflection on the way. A corner for Liverpool, from which nothing comes.The Emirates is rocking after that equaliser. Iwobi played a through-ball in behind for the striker to chase, who couldn’t take the ball around Alisson despite his best attempts. The ball breaks off the keeper and Lacazette retrieved it with his back to goal, before turning and curling a wonderful effort past both Joe Gomez and the Liverpool goalkeeper inside the far post. It’s level pegging at the Emirates. Lacazette equalises with a terrific finish. 80 min: Liverpool substitution: Xherden Shaqiri rerplaces Roberto Firmino. Arsenal substitution: Danny Welbeck replaces Sead Kolasinac. Alex Iwobi drops to full-back and Welbeck ... oh, hold on!80 min: Kolasinac takes on Alexander-Arnold down the left again and gets a cross in. Play is stopped, as the Arsenal man had let the ball run out of play.79 min: Another cross from the left into the Liverpool penalty area, this time from Kolasinac. Once again, there’s nobody on hand to steer the ball home and it rolls to safety.76 min: Xhaka plays the ball wide to Kolasinac, who feeds it on to Iwobi. He outmuscles Alexander-Arnold to surge in behind and drive the ball across the face of goal. Mesut Ozil was thundering up the pitch but not quickly enough to convert. 74 min: Atrocious from Kolasinac, who leaves Virgil van Dijk completely unmarked at a corner. The Liverpool defender rises to steer a bullet-header goalwards, but it’s straight at Bernd Leno, who palms the ball over.73 min: Another Arsenal substitution: Aubamayang off, Ramsey on. Aubamayang takes his seat in the dug-out but doesn’t look pleased to have been taken off. Trent Alexander-Arnold will certainly be glad to see the back of him.71 min: Arsenal substitution I haven’t had a chance to mention yet: Alex Iwobi replaced Henrikh Mkhitaryan two or three minutes ago.70 min: Now it’s Firmino’s turn to go close, getting the better of Hector Bellerin but heading an inviting chance wide. 69 min: Mane stretches every sinew but isn’t quite able to reach a fizzing Salah cross from the left to steer the ball home at the far post. He came from nowhere to e in there, showing an astonishing turn of speed. 68 min: Looking at replays of the Liverpool goal, I note that were actually two Liverpool players in the Arsenal box when Mane sent in his cross, but neither were anywhere near Leno when he made a hash of his attempt to gather the ball.67 min: Milner resumes duty with a plug of tissue up his left nostril to staunch the flow of blood. 65 min: Joe Gomez and James Milner while contesting the same ball and the goalscorer comes off worst. His flat on his back receiving treatment, with blood pouring from a wound on his face. It looks like he might have broken his nose.Just before that incident, Lucas Torreira had brought a smart save out of Alisson with a rising drive after haring past Fabinho and getting a sight of goal. 63 min: Oh Arsenal. They’ve gifted the lead to Liverpool. Sadio Mane was played in behind down the left flank and smashed a low cross into the penalty area, which was populated only by Arsenal players. Leno got down to block the cross, but could only fumble it out towards the edge of the penalty area, where Milner was on hand to drive it back with interest, almost taking the net off the goal-frame with the ferocity of his shot.Liverpool take the lead as James Milner capitalises on an error by Bernd Leno to smash the ball home.60 min: The clock ticks past the hour mark as the game awaits its first goal. It’s not been short of entertainment for all the lack of hot scoreboard action. 59 min: Arsenal corner. The ball’s floated deep towards Aubamayang, but Alexander-Arnold clears up for Liverpool.57 min: Between them, Rob Holding and Bernd Leno combine to prevent Roberto Firmino from scrambling the ball home from seven yards. 57 min: Trent Alexander-Arnold duels with Sead Kolasinac as he chases a long ball down the touchline. The Arsenal left-back does well to shepherd the ball out of play for a throw-in by the corner flag.54 min: Liverpool attempt to build from deep under intense pressure from Arsenal’s assorted attackers. They fail to get the ball out of their own half, allowing Mesut Ozil to go on the attack. He’s stopped by Andy Robertson and Arsenal win a corner from which nothing comes.53 min: Fabinho gets booked for a foul on somebody or other, then moments later gives away possession again. It’s only a matter of time before he gets hauled off, I’d imagine. He’s been very unimpressive. 51 min: Great defending from Virgil van Dijk, who refuses to let Mkhitarian goalside of him as he attempted to cut inside. Had the Armenian been allowed to do so, he could have squared the ball to set up Lacazette for a tap-in. 51 min: Holding intercepts as Milner attempts to thread a ball in behind for Sadio Mane to chase. 50 min: Sadio Mane pings a cross into the Arsenal penalty area, where Rob Holding heads clear.48 min: Fabinho fouls Lacazette in midfield after Lucas Torreira had picked him out with a neat pass. The Uruguayan has been very impressive today, his Brazilian counterpart considerably less so. 47 min: James Milner has moved over to the left of Liverpool’s midfield to give Trent Alexander-Arnold a hand keeping tabs on Pierre-Emerick Aubamayang, who was a real handful in the first half. Gini Wijnaldum moves to the left, where he has conceded a free-kick for a foul on Granit Xhaka. 46 min: Arsenal get the ball rolling for the second half. It’s in this period of games they’ve done most of their damage this season and they’ve given Liverpool’s defence plenty to think about already. No changes in personnel on either side after the break. It’s all square at the Emirates: There is literally no added time to a splendidly entertaining, frenetic first half that has somehow ended goalless. Both sides have had goals chalked off for offside (Liverpool’s incorrectly) and both goalkeepers have had rushes of blood to the head that could easily have cost their teams goals. Liverpool are edging it for my money, but this one remains very much in the balance.45 min: A let-off for Arsenal as Bernd Leno charges off his line to try to punch a Milner free-kick clear but gets nowhere near the ball. Virgil van Dijk gets his head to the ball, which slowly bounces towards the empty goal, only to gently hit left upright. Arsenal hack clear.43 min: Liverpool attack down the left with Firmino, Alexander-Arnold and Wijnaldum all getting on the ball. Mustafi charges over to intervene and bring that particular foray to an abrupt halt. 40 min: Now it’s Arsenal’s turn to have a goal chalked off for offside. Shkodron Mustafi is the guilty party on this occasion after heading across the face of goal from a free-kick, to tee up Lacazette for a tap-in. Moments earlier, Aubamayang had headed over the bar from eight yards when he probably should have done better. 39 min: Liverpool give the ball away again, allowing Ozil to put Lacazette in behind with a delightful bit of skill. From a tight angle, the striker sends a low effort flashing wide of the far post.38 min: Liverpool win a throw-in deep inside their own half after Lacazette puts the ball out of play under pressure from Andy Robertson. 37 min: Fabinho hasn’t been particularly impressive in Liverpool’s midfield thus far and comes under the microscope again as he loses possession to Lucas Torreira, allowing Arsenal to counter.36 min: Hector Bellerin sends in a cross from the left, which Joe Gomez heads clear. 34 min: Arsenal are using the full width of the pitch as they play the ball out from the back, with full-backs Hector Bellerin and Sead Kolasinac hugging their respective touchlines. 32 min: Good play from Arsenal, who have shots on goal by Aubamayang and Lacazette blocked in quick succession. Van Dijk gets his body in front of the first effort, while Robertson was on hand to block the second.31 min: Shkodron Mustafi shepherds a long ball from deep through to Bernd Leno. My thanks to reader Charles Antaki who has mailed in to inform me that far from being “purple”, Liverpool’s kit is in fact “African violet”. 28 min: James Milner is forced to clear for Liverpool after Sead Kolasinac gets in another cross from the left to the feet of Mkhitaryan.27 min: It seems the subject of Klopp’s earlier fury was Fabinho, who had overhit a pass to Mo Salah. The Brazilian gets another lash of his manager’s tongue for doing the same thing again.

That threat is just about dealt with but the ball squirms out to the advancing Neves who fires over. 45 min: Three added minutes due to the Dembele injury, which may have actually been to Spurs benefit (will discuss in a minute). 43 min: Lamela was almost surprised to find himself in space beyond the Wolves defence, down the right channel, and made a poor first touch before rushing his cross, intended for Kane, with the ball drifting out of harm’s way. There are more goals in this game. I’m not going to go there but Richard McGahey is...That’s at least two clear goals today (Liverpool and Wolves) denied by wrong offside decisions. But hey, who needs that stupid VAR that would hurt the game?40 min: A Moutinho corner causes some chaos in the penalty area which Spurs do eventually manage to clear. However, the ball is worked back to Moutinho who picks out Boly making a move to the near post but the defender’s ing header is well wide. This is a good reaction from the hosts. 37 min: Aaaaaaaand just as I say that, Jimenez has a goal ruled out for offside ... which was on. Moutinho getting beyond the defence and squaring for the striker to score but the Portuguese ( I assume) was ruled to have infringed. Not even that close, either. 36 min: Spurs knocking the ball about comfortably, all nice triangles and interchanges and there isn’t a great deal of pressure from Wolves, either. Lucas clips a cross into the penalty area which isn’t far from Kane connecting. Tottenham well in control. 33 min: This isn’t good for Wolves, who have only scored two goals in a Premier League game twice this season (against Everton on the opening day and Southampton on Sept. 29). Kane threatens to make matters worse with a well-struck 30-yard effort after exchanging passes with Lucas but Patricio saves, stooping to take the ball low.Simple stuff. The ball is worked out to Trippier on the right flank and with little pressure the full-back swings in a cross and Lucas, surprisingly, gets in between Coady and Bennett to head a finish. A weak one to concede from Wolves’ perspective. This from Alasdair Philip in Brooklyn. I may be in the minority but I find the camera angle at Molineux quite nice. James – was watching the game her in Brooklyn NY but given up and switched over to the  as the TV angle is one of the most vertiginously sickening I’ve ever seen.Lucas and Lamela keep interchanging positions, with the Argentine now on the right. A nice buildup in possession sees Lamela move inside, play a quick 1-2 with Son and then continue his run into the penalty area where he collects the Korean’s pass and drive a finish under Patricio. Fine goal. 25 min: Some fine play from Cavaleiro and Costa has Jonny in space down Tottenham’s right but the Spanish full-back was too hasty in trying to play in Jimenez, under-hitting his first-time pass, and Spurs are able to clear. 24 min: Sloppy from Doherty who loses the ball cheaply to Son and with the Korean running free, Bennett is forced to come across and take him down on halfway, earning a yellow card. 21 min: Son then gives the ball away just outside his own penalty area to Jimenez. The Mexican wanted a 1-2 with Cavaleiro but his teammate wasn’t having it and instead tried to shoot only to see his shot blocked. At the other end, Lucas is flagged offside. 20 min: That seemed to do the trick as Kane bursts into the penalty area to collect Lamela’s smart pass, shadowed by Boly. Kane shot across Patricio but the Portuguese did well to parry the ball away, beyond Lucas on the follow-up. 19 min: Those first-time passes I was talking about, well the Wolves defence are doing pretty well at negating their threat, stepping up and catching Kane and then Son offside. Pochettino isn’t happy and is having a word with Kane. 17 min: Confident stuff from Foyth who stepped into midfield, shimmied past one Wolves player and was then fouled by Moutinho. 14 min: There have been quite a few attempts at playing first-time killer passes, by both sides, trying to catch he opposition defence out of shape. Neves, Moutinho, Winks and Lamela are all pretty damn fine passers but nothing has quite come off just yet, bar that Moutinho ball to Doherty a couple of minutes ago. 12 min: Doherty involved again. Moutinho dinks a fine pass out to the right-back who cuts inside Davies and shoots with his left foot but it’s dragged and largely comfortable for Lloris. 11 min: First shot of the match to Wolves. Davies was caught in possession by Doherty, conceding a throw in and the ball is quickly returned into play to Jimenez who turns and shoots from 25 yards but it flies high and wide. 8 min: Confirmation that Lucas is on the right, Lamela in the centre and Son to the left. Lamela in the middle could be a lot of fun. 6 min: Dembele is coming off, folks. Being helped around the goal by two physios. Son is on, which I guess switches things to a 4-2-3-1 with Lamela central playmaker. We shall see.5 min: Fantastic ball out of defence from Foyth into the path of Lamela, waiting on the halfway. As Morgan said earlier, *that* is exactly why he’s in the team. 3 min: Dembele is helped off the pitch with Eriksen and Son among those warming up. I’d say the Belgian looks unlikely to continue at the moment. 2 min: Wolves players and fans are a little annoyed with Mike Dean after Costa was brought down in full flight by Davies. But it was a fair tackle, however in the process the Welshman sent the Wolves forward careering into Dembele who looks in some bother on his 250th appearance for the club. 1 min: Foyth is given an early touch with Tottenham knocking the ball around in the middle of the par before Davies attempts a through-ball down the touchline intended for Lucas but it runs out for a goal kick. Here is David Hytner’s match report from the EmiratesA lot of love between Nuno and Poch on the touchline...The players are on the pitch and kick-off approaches...Fine stat courtesy of Sky Sports there, Mauricio Pochettino hasn’t lost as manager against a promoted team in 27 previous matches. Also interesting to see that despite being the fourth-lowest scorers in the Premier League with just nine, Wolves rank fourth for shots per game on 14.5, Tottenham a little further back on 13.0. No team has a higher differential between their expected goals (13.03) and actual goals scored than Santo’s side’s +4.03. Barn doors and banjos etc. Some people may or may not be surprised to see Dele Alli’s name missing from the Spurs squad. Pochettino has been explaining his reasons. Alli, who’s been plagued with hamstring trouble this season, played 16 minutes off the bench against Manchester City and started the League Cup tie against West Ham, laying 64 minutes. He played from the beginning of the game against West Ham. He’s not at 100 per cent to compete with the demands of playing three games in six days and we need to build his fitness step by step. Mauricio Pochettino’s not-so secret admirers in Madrid were in action earlier and, blimey, they won a game. It’s all over at the Emirates where Arsenal played pretty well in claiming a 1-1 draw. Alexandre Lacazette’s equaliser was a beaut as well. Barry Glendenning as all the reaction. Match report to follow...In case you missed it, the buildup to this game has beenWatch out, Gary Neville’s about: applying mean-spirited adjectives to Tottenham sides 1992-2014 (although not the ones managed by Harry Redknapp, of course). Morgan O’Hanrahan’s take on Foyth being given a start. Wholeheartedly agree on Sanchez. You’re also more likely to be entertained by the last 12 minutes or so of the Arsenal v Liverpool contest at the Emirates than me, so switch over to my colleague Barry Glendenning on that particular MBM. Then come back. Please. If you’re just catching up on all the Premier League action of the day, then why not do it via the medium of our fine correspondents. Deep breath, here we go...Here are your teams...Wolves making one change with Ivan Cavaleiro replacing Adama Traoré in the front three. Meanwhile, Juan Foyth will make his Premier League debut in place of Davinson Sanchez, which is interesting, and Harry Winks comes in for Eric Dier in midfield.Well, I guess we’d better get used to this sort of thing, if the 11 ‘Founding Fathers of the European Super League’ (bless ‘em) have their greedy little way a 7.45pm kick-off on a Saturday featuring English clubs could become the norm. Although Tottenham will have reason to feel aggrieved they’ve been left out of the Premier Leagues little cabal. Three successive top-four finishes under Mauricio Pochettino and yet they’re still not considered as part of England’s elite, what more do they need to do (other than maybe deliver a super-smashing new stadium on time...)?! Anyway, crisis appears to have enveloped Spurs this week following their first league defeat for ... five matches ... and now Wolves can really hammer the nail in whatever coffinLying in wait is a coach who has echoes of Pochettino at Southampton as Nuno Espírito Santo has arrived from relative obscurity from Spain and energised a whole club, even making them a bit sexy and fashionable. Which, outside of Robert Plant’s support, has always seemed somewhat of an unlikely characteristic for one of England’s oldest clubs. Even stranger when you consider their matches have featured the fewest amount of goals of anyone in the Premier League – just nine four and nine against in 10 matches. Not really European Super League quality, lads.Kick-off is at 7.45pm BST (yes, really)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dff288818919556195f24c779e0738594619f0d/0_3137_4964_2979/master/4964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01d18506d8ab802ee1cea816b6be6c89","title":"beachcombers de luxe on the kent coast","story":"There’s a distinctly 70s vibe in this luxury-meets-louche seaside flat in RamsgateIn Wendy Aldridge’s Ramsgate home, the decor drops a few subtle hints to its coastal setting, but that’s not really the main aim. Yes, there are paintings of skeletal fish and sailing boats and a Curtis Jeré wall sculpture depicting birds in flight. But it bears only a passing resemblance to the local gulls, which tend to loiter on street corners rather than fly in picturesque formations.Wendy never aimed to create a sugar-sweet version of seaside style in this flat, which she renovated with her husband, James. “We wanted to include a few reminders that the sea is just outside the front door, but without being too obvious,” she says. Instead, she has mixed 1970s, mid-century and contemporary designs together to create a less clichéd coastal look.The couple, parents to Ida, eight, and Arlie, five, bought this basement flat two and a half years ago. They initially tried to buy in Margate but then looked five miles south to Ramsgate. No Turner Contemporary or Tracey Emin neons here, but there is a nice beach and some interesting architecture, including sea-facing Victorian townhouses, long since carved up into flats and bedsits.This flat had been rented out for many years, so wasn’t in the best shape, but two rooms had been knocked into one big space at the front. “This meant we could immediately imagine how it would work for us as a family,” says Wendy.Originally, this run of rooms would have been dedicated to serving a Victorian family on the floors above. Wendy fully embraced the flat’s below-stairs vibe with dark paint colours, offset with glossy white tiling, flashes of gold and warm-toned mid-century furniture.Then there’s the centrepiece sofa – a louche 1970s number in sage-green velvet that was shipped over from Italy. “It’s so low-slung, you literally sink into it,” says Wendy. “I like to imagine it having a very glamorous life before it came to us, in a nightclub or a chic apartment,” she adds. As if proof of its partying past, the upholstery bears the odd cigarette burn. “I’d never replace that velvet, so they’ll remain as part of its character.”Facing it is a leather sofa by the Brazilian designer Percival Lafer, which almost qualifies as an impulse buy. “James went to pick up a chair and the guy was also thinking of selling his sofa. James rang to ask what I thought. I said, ‘If you can squeeze it into the car, go for it.’ It fitted in by a whisker.”These luxe sofas, coffee tables in marble and glass and thickly woven wall hangings give the flat a strong 1970s vibe. But Wendy was careful to avoid getting too “themey”: “I didn’t want everything to be from the same era,” she says. “I like my rooms to feel less formulaic than that.”As the woman behind the online shop Homeplace, Wendy is known for bringing together a pick ’n’ mix of different style decades, and making it work. Likewise, in this home, Art Deco sits next to mid-century modern prints work alongside vintage Danish lights and Charlotte Perriand chairs elevate an Ikea kitchen.As well as online auctions, Wendy used local shops to furnish the flat, including Ramsgate’s Petticoat Lane Emporium and the near-legendary Junk Deluxe in Margate. That’s where they found the brass floor light that dips elegantly over the leather sofa. “We actually went to collect a different lamp that I’d reserved, but when we saw this one I asked if we could do a swap,” she says.Similarly, the fireplace in the living room was retiled in a white honeycomb mosaic to contrast with the Farrow \u0026amp Ball Down Pipe grey walls. The tiles replaced an old 1980s faux marble surround, but weren’t exactly an easy option. “The first batch of tiles didn’t match up then the tiler disappeared. I could picture it in my head long before it came together,” Wendy says.Tiles also form a graph paper-like grid on one wall of the kitchen, where Ikea units keep things real, but customised with sections of grey paint and soft leather handles. “Throughout the flat, I’ve kept finishes very practical – because with two kids and a dog that’s the only way to be,” says Wendy. “But I’ve also tried to add originality at every opportunity.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The architects made it. I mean, obviously they designed it – but they also got down dirty and helped to build it. “Anything we could do ourselves, we did,” says Sophie Goldhill, partner, along with her husband David Liddicoat, in the young firm Liddicoat \u0026amp Goldhill. “Sweeping up, running out to the building suppliers, carrying the bricks – you name it.”She and Liddicoat more or less moved their office and staff to the building site in east London to manage the project. I’ve watched enough episodes of Grand Designs to know this can be a disaster, resulting in rows, orce, bankruptcy and a lot of eye-rolling from the bricklayers. “No, no,” Liddicoat corrects. “If anything, the making was more fun than the designing.”But why on earth would you? They’re architects, of course, genetically predisposed towards control freakery, to obsess over details such as the precise alignment of plug sockets. But making buildings, physically, with your hands, is not necessarily part of an architect’s training. “When you study architecture you’re so disconnected from the process of building,” Goldhill says. “That seems very odd to us,” Liddicoat adds.They have form. In 2008, the couple built their first home, the Shadow House, on a plot in the upper reaches of Camden Town, north London. “We couldn’t afford to buy anything,” Liddicoat recalls. “But there was this moment after the crash in 2008 when you could find postage-stamp-sized plots in London, overlooked by developers, relatively affordably.”By building it themselves they could make it even more affordable and learn the nitty-gritty of how a building actually comes into being. “It was an education,” says Goldhill. “You have to have a military attitude,” Liddicoat says. Architecture, adds Goldhill, “is mostly logistics”.They must have enjoyed it because no sooner had they moved in than they started all over again. Only bigger. And with a baby on the way. With their firm expanding, they decided to sell the Shadow House to buy a studio for an office and this plot for their family. Well, that was the plan.This time they were managing 100 people on site, and dozens of contractors. But it gave the couple incredible control over the result. “We got really nerdy,” Liddicoat says. “We’d try things out: how materials smelled, or felt when you walked on them barefoot.” (This surely drew eye-rolls from the bricklayers.) The site was awkward, trapezoid – “inherently complex”, Liddicoat says – on a busy street, overlooked by neighbours on all sides and in a conservation area with listed buildings. The full whammy, which probably accounts for the plot’s affordability. By running the project themselves they saved money to spend elsewhere. First of all: space. Goldhill and Liddicoat went in all guns blazing, with a design over five floors. “We fully expected the planners to tell us to lop the top off or scrap the basement,” Liddicoat says. But they didn’t.All that obsession paid off. The house is immaculately made, not a duff detail in sight. The idea, says Goldhill, was to create a contemporary version of the kind of Victorian villas built nearby. “If 19th-century builders were building today, what would they do?”It is a deep house, with the main, split-level living-space-cum-kitchen-cum-dining-room especially cavernous. Even on a dull day, the interior is bright, its space sliced with shafts of light. Large windows punctuate the front and back walls on the side walls, the stepped shape of the house allows clerestory windows to run at ceiling height front to back. Those five floors fold on top of one another, open-plan, of course, with internal spaces ided mostly by sliding doors or thick, colourful curtains, to be configured how you want. The top floor has two bedrooms and a bathroom the floor below two more bedrooms, a large bathroom, a closet and what is currently a makeshift office below that lies the gigantic main living space on two levels and, finally, a basement snug and utility room.They didn’t stint on materials. “It’s important for a home to feel right,” Goldhill says, “and so much of that comes from the materials you see and touch.” The facade is fronted by expensive Danish Petersen bricks. But, being an entrepreneurial pair, such indulgences “are offset with cheap raw materials”, Liddicoat says, like pavement concrete kerb stones from B\u0026ampQ. The pair liked their “rawness” and originally wanted to use them liberally on the facade. The local conservation officer disagreed. Instead they are used at the base of the walls as a kind of plinth. And in the main living space, the whole office stayed up till 2am one night to fix a giant net to the staircase instead of a banister: “Cost: £29.99,” Goldhill says.After all that slog, the couple only lived in the house for a few months. A second child had come along. “We were beginning to think again about where we wanted to bring up our family,” Goldhill says. Then the London property market exploded.So they sold the house to a designerarchitect couple, Valentina Audrito and Abhi Kumbhat, and their family. They have filled the house with quirky art, flashes of neon, and out-there furniture designed by Audrito’s architect parents: an armchair in the form of a gold lamé purse a pair of gigantic golden lips for a sofa.Liddicoat and Goldhill upped sticks to Whitstable in Kent and moved the office to Margate. “We were a bit sad to part with the house, but for us it was more the process of creating and making it that was important. We were really excited to see Abhi and Valentina move in and start to make it their own.”The family now live, Goldhill says, in an “unlovely bungalow – but at least we have our next project.” The Makers House, meanwhile, is up for the Royal Institute of British Architects’ House of the Year prize this autumn. Whether or not it wins, it’s a supreme lesson in getting the most – space, value for money, beauty – from one patch of land.• See the Makers House in Grand Designs: RIBA House of the Year, on Channel 4 this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af54a553ce21ac7fede15f4959b57fa34eace9a1/0_320_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232e95b09be8e0e52ca53e5722506b8a","title":"i earn 70000 but dont live a lavish lifestyle and give much of it away","story":"Nigel Farnall on how he helps the community, including the Theatre Royal Stratford EastAs my partner and I don’t have any children and we don’t lead an extravagant lifestyle, I try to be generous with both my time and money. I give £1,500 a year to the Theatre Royal Stratford East and I paid about £2,000 to name seats after myself, my partner and my two nieces. I know many of the theatre’s initiatives are aimed at the younger generation, which is particularly important to me.I also have a £50-a-month standing order to my local church and whenever there’s a fundraiser, I chip in about the same amount. I’m not very religious but I do it for two reasons – first, congregation numbers may not reflect it, but the church is a pillar of our community. Second, one day I will be buried there, and I don’t want it to be turned into flats before then.Also, when there’s a big disaster that needs donations, I’ll generally give £250 or £500 through the Disasters Emergency Committee.I’ve run a landscape business for the past 20 years with my business partner, Kieran. I started helping my nan in her garden when I was four. By the time I was 11, I was working odd jobs around the community – clearing gardens, trimming hedges and wood chopping, and so on. I earn about £70,000 a year through the business, but it’s also important to me to help the community.I’ve probably donated about £30,000 of work, mainly helping with fencing, to my old primary school over the past seven years through our company. There are various motivations for this – it’s good PR, it’s nice to be involved with the school that did so much for me when I was a child, and it’s good for the local community.Recently my company, Carnall Landscapes, spent two months clearing a public byway adjacent to my home. It hadn’t been maintained for decades, so we set about doing it ourselves. We cleared and resurfaced it and now anyone can use it.In 2016, I was surprised to win the Achates Philanthropy prize for my donations to the theatre. It involved an awards evening with about 200 people and then being whisked away in a taxi to be interviewed by BBC Radio 4 about it. It was all a bit surreal.I live in the house I was brought up in. Four years ago I bought my mum’s share when she moved into a neighbouring property she inherited. We’re having some major renovations done which will cost in the region of £400,000. We’re extending it, building an outside office, and installing solar panels, a rainwater harvesting system and hopefully a ground source heat pump too. I want to be as self-sufficient as I can be.Due to the renovation work, I currently pay two mortgages, which adds up to just over £2,100 a month. I own another property which I rent out for £1,200 a month. It was my grandfather’s council flat and we bought it together in 2004. Sadly, he passed away two years later. I’m mortgage-free on that property. One of my mottos in life is to pay back what you borrow as soon as you can, which I did very quickly with this purchase.We live in the middle of nowhere, so we have no gas – we get hot water from a log burner that uses wood which I get for free through work. Energy bills come to about £30 a month. I don’t have a car – I have a transit van which I use for work, and if I need one, I borrow my mum’s car.As for groceries, my partner organises the food shopping for us and the two dogs.

Held aloft by the crowd, the topless musician turns himself partly upside down to take advantage of the Academy’s low-hanging architecture.This is not behaviour you would expect from a dentist. By night, though, the NHS’s mutton-chopped Bowen is often to be found wearing only his pants, one of two prancing guitarists in a rowdy, shouty outfit playing the final night of a sold-out UK tour. (“For the last fucking time, we’re not a punk band,” Idles’ singer Joe Talbot claimed at a recent gig in Manchester.)Earlier this year, the Bristol outfit’s independently released second album charted at No 5 it has now sold more than 25,000 copies, according to the label – an exciting amount for a furious record about Brexit and loving yourself. Earlier this month, Idles won Q’s best breakthrough act – an award they split with Goat Girl, because this year’s field was of such high quality. The band are off to Europe next and to Australia in January, where venues are being upgraded to satisfy demand. You suspect every night on an Idles tour is a messy celebration – not for nothing is their second album named Joy As An Act of Resistance – but somehow, the normal rules banning crowd-surfing are suspended tonight. Everyone goes a little nuts.Within moments of the deathwatch beetle percussion and end-of-days bassline that begins Colossus, the place is a sauna. The low ceiling helps, of course, but Idles also know how to create an atmosphere: hellish red lamps, searchlights and the way Colossus builds and builds owe something to the menace of old post-hardcore bands such as the Jesus Lizard or Swans, the song pivoting into a raucous punkoid thrash. Frontman Talbot might disavow the punk label, but the band’s higher gear certainly sends beer arcing upwards and creates a vortex in the centre of the room. And what does the band’s bug-eyed, bearded lead growler do with the tumble dryer of testosterone churning before him? He lectures it about not touching anyone without their consent. “I can’t believe we’re still having these conversations,” he mutters darkly.On one level, Idles are an olly-olly-olly affair: a direct band with a lot of route-one music that climaxes in massed shouted choruses. For all the gruff machismo of their transmission, though, all human life is in their songs: frustration and hard-won self-knowledge and frailty and grief and love. Take Danny Nedelko, another song off Joy. Delivered as a terrace chant – “Danny Nedel-koh-oh!” – it is, notionally, about Talbot’s friend who happens to play in the support band Heavy Lungs, rather than right-back for Bristol Rovers.Nedelko runs on stage from the wings. “My blood brother is an immigrant,” howls Talbot, crushing Nedelko in a man-hug. The song, meanwhile, goes on to detail a number of Talbot’s other blood brothers: “a Nigerian mother of three”, “Malala”, “a Polish butcher” and “Mo Farah”. It’s a rallying cry for community, against those who would whip up hate and fear. The band played it on Later… With Jools Holland last month, a landmark performance that saw guitarist Bowen lie across Holland’s piano before kicking the host off the ivories for a tinkle, and exposed Idles’ right-side-of-history ramalama to a much wider audience. The most obvious fellow travellers with Idles are Sleaford Mods – to the point where Talbot actually shouts, “I’m a Sleaford Mod!” during I’m Scum – but there is a hollering sense of common purpose to Idles’ songs that provides comfort, where Sleaford Mods’ scabrous intelligence supplies less.Tonight, we get most of Joy and choice cuts of Idles’ backstory. Born in Exeter (where “nothing ever happens, over and over again”), Talbot has lived a few lifetimes in his 33 years: he started out from humble beginnings, as I’m Scum declares: “Council house and violent, sleeping under sirens.” He had repeated surgery for a club foot Catholicism figured, as it does with the Hold Steady, another punk-derived band with an emphasis on community.Circular riffs introduce the heroically sludgy, low-slung Divide and Conquer, off the band’s debut, Brutalism (2017), written in the wake of Talbot’s mother’s death her ashes ended up in a number of copies of the album. When Talbot was 16, Christine had a stroke and – an only child – he became her primary carer when his stepfather died a couple of years later. As Talbot tells it, he didn’t always do the greatest of jobs looking after her, but NHS cuts contributed to her death.“A loved one perished at the hand of the baron-hearted right,” snarls Talbot. You hear it “barren-hearted”, but you suspect Talbot had robber barons in mind too when he spelled it that way. We’re in Oxford, alma mater of the Tory elite, where lines such as “A heathen From Eton With a bag of Michael Keaton,” are particularly apposite (Keaton starred in a 1988 film about cocaine addiction called Clean and Sober).Talbot was once an even angrier person, which is, you suspect, really just a hurting person in a male body. The song Samaritans lists a number of pat phrases used to stifle male emotion. “Socks up Don’t cry Drink up Don’t whine,” glowers Talbot, before ending the song with one of the band’s occasional pop culture references. “I kissed a boy and I liked it!” he hollers. Katy Perry isn’t the only Easter egg Danny Nedelko contains a tiny aside Pavement fans might recognise as a nod to their song Stereo.As though Talbot hadn’t been through enough, he and his partner lost their baby as Joy As An Act of Resistance was being made, unleashing yet more anguish. Talbot mentions his daughter in the intro to Television Brutalism’s Mother, meanwhile, pays tribute to his own mother’s long working hours, and nods to Margaret Atwood.The end comes with the band’s two guitarists trying to outdo each other with feedback. But the gig climaxes in an act of communion a few songs previously, when a dozen people clamber up on stage to dance and Heavy Lungs rush on to throw roses into the crowd. Prowling the stage, hitting himself with his mic, Talbot comes across as an aggro merchant – it’s one of his “masks of masculinity” – but he is a geyser of emotion, much of it positive. He tells the crowd if they’re headed for the merch stall, to buy Heavy Lungs T-shirts, not Idles ones. Every song is dedicated either to a specific person, or to the backroom staff who keep the tour going. The band’s Twitter feed features an end-of-tour haiku. “Last show in UK To everyone who has come Want to hug you all,” it goes. There is succour here in Idles’ sweat lodge."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing today in focus","story":"Today in Focus is a new daily podcast that brings you closer to  journalism.

The average gap between rent and housing benefit for families stuck on the cap was £3,750 a year.Senior MPs said the analysis showed people were being “pushed to the brink of destitution” by a policy that was not working. The group of households stuck under the cap also includes disproportionate numbers of people requiring help due to illness or disability.Theresa May is still under pressure over welfare despite a £1bn package in the budget to make the universal credit system more generous. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has found that three-quarters of the £12bn in welfare cuts announced after the 2015 election remain government policy.Frank Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: “As with universal credit, the driver of this reform was meant to be getting people into work, and you can escape the cap if you do. But we know that for too many, especially those with young children, work simply doesn’t pay and is out of reach.“If getting into work that pays isn’t a genuine, realistic possibility for each person affected by the cap, and they are as a result pushed to the brink of destitution, we must ask why, and ask also whether the cap should operate at all for this group.”Further analysis by Policy in Practice, carried out on a sample of council tenants across 11 English local authorities, showed those stuck on the benefit cap are more likely to be in debt.The benefit cap was lowered in 2016 and limits the total amount of benefits a household can receive to a maximum of £20,000 a year, or £23,000 for families in London.Deven Ghelani, the director of Policy in Practice, said: “I have always been open to this policy having a positive impact for those families moving into work. However, our analysis shows that the positive employment outcomes and savings generated do not appear to offset the financial costs, or crucially, the human and social costs associated with rising levels of economic destitution.”Chris Goulden, the deputy director at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said work was the best route out of poverty for most people, but those with limited options because of their health or disability could be unfairly affected.“With the high and rising cost of housing, especially in the capital, these shortfalls in income can lead to a rising tide of debt as people struggle to find ways to stay afloat that don’t end up worsening their situation,” he said. “The benefit cap is a clumsy solution to a real problem caused by high rents, low paid work and barriers to engaging in paid work among groups like disabled people.”The Department for Work and Pensions said official statistics showed that seven in 10 households came off the cap eventually. It said help was being provided to single parents looking for appropriate work, and around 54,000 households were no longer subject to the cap.Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, said: “The benefit cap ensures we have a fairer system – fair for the taxpayer and fair for claimants – as well as a system that incentivises work. So it’s not surprising that we now have the lowest unemployment figures since 1975.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/065585208aba7f7197c2620ba4f9b4c8381a0afa/0_0_4927_2956/master/4927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daf8da02c73c8cd1f54a5ed7f653c7a2","title":"england south africa autumn international match report","story":"Crisis? What crisis? England overcame a chronic injury list that ravaged their forwards and the biggest pack in world rugby to start their autumn campaign with a victory that looked improbable at half-time. Their resistance was summed up by Mark Wilson, a flanker who filled in for three unavailable players at No 8 and absorbed everything thrown at him as the ghosts refused to buckle.Each side had four survivors from the starting line-up on when the countries last met here two years ago, proof in England’s case of an ever-expanding injury-list and in South Africa’s evidence of their transition since the last World Cup. If the hosts had picked a team to wear out their opponents, the Springboks were looking to wear down the home side with six of their starting line-up more than 18st and four more on the bench.England, in contrast, had only the replacement prop Harry Williams in that bracket, although at a stated 20st 10lb he was the second heaviest player involved after South Africa’s reserve loose-head Thomas du Toit.The Rugby Football Union had promised white noise at the national team’s kit unveiling last month, but after a run of one victory in six Tests, white poise was the requirement.Owen Farrell led out England, followed by his co-captain, Dylan Hartley, suggesting the fly-half has become primus inter pares. A question before the match was which of them would speak to the referee, Angus Gardner, but the Australian was not listening to either as the home side conceded five penalties in the opening 15 minutes and lost Maro Itoje to the sin-bin for killing the ball near his line.England were showing their inexperience as South Africa set about them by sending big runners down narrow channels or using the boot of the fly-half, Handré Pollard, to test the opposition back three. They conceded penalties at the lineout and maul and lapses in defence betrayed a team missing a number of its regulars, but they had the resolve to suffocate a Springbok team that did not indulge in the unexpected.Pollard gave South Africa the lead with a 40-metre penalty after six minutes when Kyle Sinckler strayed offside, but they failed to capitalise on Itoje’s stint in the sin-bin. The second row saw yellow for preventing release after tackling Ivan van Zyl soon after Henry Slade and Jonny May foiled S’busiso Nkosi who had beaten Daly to a Pollard high kick and was held up on England’s line.England scored their first points during Itoje’s absence, Farrell kicking a 40-metre penalty when Aphiwe Dyantyi’s fumbling of Ben Youngs’s box kick was followed by Peter-Steph du Toit playing the ball in an offside position.South Africa wasted two attacking lineouts after they had kicked penalties to touch when Malcolm Marx overthrew and with a number of moves ending with fumbles, they did not reflect a side that had beaten the All Blacks seven weeks ago.They were unable to exploit pushing England off their scrum ball after more lax passing, but eventually their pressure told. Damien de Allende, who kept attacking Ben Te’o’s shoulder, again stormed the gainline and after Pollard had squandered an overlap Dyantyi came into midfield from his win to give Nkosi just enough room to evade Te’o’s covering tackle.It was due reward for the team that had spent most of the half in their opponents’ territory, but England’s first restart had nearly caught out South Africa, kicked short and flat by Farrell but too hard for May, and their second resulted in a penalty that Farrell kicked to take England into the interval 8-6 down, a moral lead given their scant possession and they reflected on it before going into the dressing room in a huddle on halfway.South Africa confounded England after the restart when de Allende threw a long pass rather than seek out Te’o, but otherwise it was more of the same, continuing to look for stress fractures. Their victory over New Zealand, and the subsequent near-miss in Pretoria, was based on defence and forcing mistakes they were less comfortable taking the initiative and as England started to secure possession, they were able to increase the pace of the game and took the lead after 50 minutes through the boot of Elliot Daly with a penalty just inside South Africa’s half after de Allende had played the ball on the floor but they started to find space. Itoje and Farrell made clean breaks, Daly and May became involved and the Springboks found themselves scrambling in defence.May fielded a Pollard kick in his own 22 and weaved his way to the halfway line where he linked with Jack Nowell who slipped out of two tackles before finding Youngs. The premium England place on fitness was starting to tell and as replacements came on the game opened up more. Danny Care and Zach Mercer gave England added zip but South Africa regained the lead when Brad Shields was penalised near the halfway line and Pollard, five minutes after Farrell’s 45-metre kick had dropped short, was on target.South Africa’s early dominance had, though, faded. England came again and when they had an attacking scrum, Williams won the battle of the 20st props, twisting du Toit so that the prop became detached from the set-piece. Farrell turned the penalty into three points and England had seven minutes to survive.They did, thanks to Pollard grazing the right post with a penalty from 48 metres after England’s scrum had collapsed. South Africa had a final chance when they were under England’s posts, but Pollard did not get into position for a drop goal and Lood de Jager was dispossessed by Farrell.The final play was Farrell felling Andre Esterhuizen with a no-arms tackle. A review checked on the height rather than the challenge itself and it was just below head height. Twickenham breathed a sigh of relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66696d74fa7e08ffa9cfd5f027ee27466dfaff4f/0_118_3262_1957/master/3262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f03c1029457d8e3911231100180933d","title":"wales scotland autumn international match report","story":"Another Wales-Scotland match in Cardiff, another Wales win. This, the 10th such victory in a row, will resonate least of the recent run, sneaked in at an unfamiliar time of year, the selections compromised, the motives suspect. The really important matter lay beyond rugby. The match will be remembered for the inauguration of the Doddie Weir Cup, in honour of the guest of honour, who is battling motor-neurone disease with all the dignity and good humour we have come to know so well.Those who remember what happened on the field at all will attribute Wales’s win to superior power, particularly through the outside-centre channel, Huw Jones missing the crucial tackle for Wales’s two tries. George North went over for his 34th for Wales in the first half and in the second it was Jonathan Davies sprung through the same gate.No arguing with the win, even if neither side hit the heights bar the odd surge here and there. Wales scored on those two occasions they threatened Scotland did not, Alex Dunbar’s break through Hadleigh Parkes a highlight of their first half, and Peter Horne’s near miss that of the second. Neither side seemed entirely sure of themselves.Still, Wales will be happy, what with their reputation as slow starters. This, extraordinarily, is the first time they have won their opening Test of the autumn since 2002 – and that was against Romania in a game otherwise memorable for the debut of Gethin Jenkins, who plays his last match , for Cardiff Blues next door.Since then, their opening autumn games have invariably been against one of the southern hemisphere’s big three, usually on an unauthorised weekend. Rugby is torn over these Tests outside the international window. The Welsh and Scottish unions managed to get this one past the welfare police by announcing it as in support of Weir. And then it transpired that no proceeds from the game would be donated to his cause. Cue rugby’s latest humiliating climbdown, the two unions shamed into promising a six-figure donation.It lent the match an uncertain status, no one really knowing what to expect from a fixture whose long and exciting history has overwhelmingly been consigned to the first few months of the year. The sides felt their way in accordingly. Any players based outside their respective countries were unavailable, so new combinations were on show in key positions for both teams.Scotland had promising youngsters in the No 10 and 15 shirts, Adam Hastings’s selection particularly anticipated. The son of Gavin got off to a nervy start, a couple of loose kicks from hand hardly inspiring confidence, but he has a swagger that bodes well and he kicked with assurance to land convert a penalty and conversion in the second quarter.By the time he had landed the first, Wales were 9-0 up without really doing anything. Thirteen penalties in the first half did not help the game’s flow, but it did give Leigh Halfpenny the chance to do his thing from the tee, before North registered his latest try on the half-hour. Scotland’s defence had been vigorous, but North exploded on to a pass from behind Jonathan Davies’s dummy run and Huw Jones was done for.Scotland responded swiftly to the 14-3 deficit that try established. Stuart McInally, captain in the absence of John Barclay and Greig Laidlaw, finished off a lineout and drive that Wales defended with rather less vigour. They continued their new dominance into the second half, but it was Wales who struck next.Huw Jones was exposed again in defence, but this time it was more a case of his being isolated in a midfield bewitched by a sweet Wales move from a lineout. Gareth Anscombe, in such deadly attacking form of late, looped menacingly behind Parkes and released Jonathan Davies past the lonely Jones.Wales’s defensive maul improved in the second half, but Jonny Gray was driven inches short on the hour, when he could not resist a double movement to bring one attack to an end. Otherwise, Scotland looked at a loss to find a way through or round the Welsh wall, until they worked one down the right. Blair Kinghorn, accomplished at full-back, combined with Tommy Seymour and George Horne to set Alex Dunbar at the line. Elliot Dee was coaxed into a yellow-card offence, and Scotland thought they had scored through the Horne brothers. George chipped in-goal, but Peter could not quite ground the ball. It was as close as either side would come in the final quarter. Scotland could not make their extra man tell.Indeed, their full complement was driven off their own ball at a scrum from the next play. They never quite found their rhythm.Wales were hardly scintillating either, but they move on to their autumn nemesis, Australia, next Saturday in better shape than usual at this time of year. A win there would be a seventh in a row. And next year is World Cup year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/281204a3bded351056d9c423a5800545edca5aa4/664_370_4118_2471/master/4118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=805669b44d4be12591fcdb3ba828b163","title":"stuart broad england spinners sri lanka first test","story":"Jimmy Anderson could lose his seam partner should the tourists opt for horses for courses in GalleThis is a special place for a Test match. Two sides of Galle’s cricket ground are flanked by the ocean and a third is overlooked by the magnificent old Dutch fort where the pauper and the miser can share an excellent view of the cricket. On Saturday the skeletons of the awnings to be fixed over the stands were being erected to prevent English spectators from being frazzled or drenched come Tuesday for the first Test against Sri Lanka – hopefully the former is the greater peril but there are no guarantees at this time of the year.There was also some activity out in the middle. The square is a luscious green and a few days ago there were photographs of the Test pitch, which was the same colour. Now the much-discussed strip of turf that constitutes the playing surface is easily distinguishable. Grass is still visible but is no longer emerald green. The ground staff were scrubbing the turf with brushes in anticipation of another trim.The likelihood is that the pitch will be browner by Tuesday and that it will soon be receptive to a spinning cricket ball. Given the recent weather – there have been more showers in Galle as well as a mighty thunderstorm on Friday night in Colombo – there will, no doubt, be some moisture there.But do not expect either captain to invite the opposition to bat on Tuesday morning. It will be a surprise to everyone if the ball does not start turning early in the game, including Rangana Herath, the deceptively cuddly left-arm spinner and an inspiration to so many club cricketers around the world given his physique, age and speed around the ground, who, in his final Test, is eager to add to his haul of 430 Test wickets, 99 of which have been taken at Galle. The 40-year-old could not resist the prospect of one more outing here and at least one more wicket at his most beloved venue.England will be acutely aware that they are in foreign territory. Just two of their number have ever played a Test match in Sri Lanka – Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – and here it is not certain that the latter will make the final XI, in which case this would be the first time Broad has been dropped from the Test team since 2012.Our philosopher is not afraid to state the bleeding obvious occasionally. The winning formula? “We’ve got to get big runs. And then 20 wickets. It’s not rocket science.” He is also realistic: “The wickets we have played on last week have been really flat, a little different to what we are likely to get in the Test matches. The spinners are going to play a huge part.”How many of their spinners will England play? Anderson could not tell us that in part because none of the England camp had seen the pitch at close quarters. If Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace, who know conditions here so well, spy something similar to what greeted the South Africans last July then expect England to play all three of their spinners.Such a selection would leave Anderson’s old partner, Broad, vulnerable. “I honestly don’t know if he will play. At this stage I’d say it’s impossible to pick that starting XI‚” he said. If Broad is omitted then there can be no disguising the fact that he will be dropped on a horses-for-courses basis rather than rested. Anderson acknowledges the logic that neither he nor Broad have played since September so they can hardly be rested in the first week of November.“There was a question asked if I was keen to tour this winter and I said yes and that was pretty much the end of it‚” he explained. “The amount of cricket I play at the moment is manageable, and Stuart would say the same for himself. We don’t play any white-ball cricket so there’s no reason why we cannot be fit for all Test cricket. That’s how we look at it. There are plenty of gaps for us to rest and recuperate.”Broad, despite the hostile conditions, remains commendably eager to play. It will be a tricky call for the hierarchy as will sorting out England’s best batting lineup. Here the focus is on Joe Denly. It seems that the management have been keen to have him in their Test team especially since Jonny Bairstow became unlikely to be available for selection. Yet Denly’s performances so far, ,albeit in matches that were little more than middle practice, have been unconvincing. There are no like-for-like alternatives in the frame, so curiously Denly’s woes enhance the chances of Ben Foakes or Chris Woakes making the final XI. But as Anderson sagely points out, nobody really knows at the moment – and that may well include the England management."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25987eb20a4fbea233ffc683c36e075f472ddffc/0_375_4622_2774/master/4622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ddc8e900d1bc156ef11545663e35ad9","title":"breeders cup 2018 day two live","story":"A fine win for Monomoy Girl, though the runner-up was closing her down at the line, but not the duel that everyone hoped to see.

His non-committal response did rather suggest that he won’t be. Frankie is in the interview room.  He broke good then took a false step and I had to switch to Plan B. I asked him to pick up around the turn and he took off from there.Sir Michael Stoute was also responsible for Queen’s Trust, Dettori’s last winner at the Breeders’ Cup, two years ago and the trainer now has eight winners at the meeting in all, the best performance by any British trainer by some way. Expert Eye was eighth as they turned out of the back but Dettori made ground wide as they rounded the turn and was sixth as they straightened up. It looked for all the world as though Catapult and Analyze It would fight out the finish as the pair of them shot a couple of lengths clear but they gave Expert Eye something to aim at and once Dettori got him running, he cut them down with a stride or two to spare. Brilliant stuff, and a second European-trained winner at the meet. Dettori debuted his famous flying dismount at Chuchill Downs after winning on Barathea in 1994, and he’s about to do it again 24 years later. That really is one for the Dettori scrapbook. Brilliance in the saddle by Frankie Dettori, who delivered Expert Eye right on the line to win his 13th race at the Breeders’ Cup. Analyze It, Divisidero and Catapult were fighting it out well inside the final furlong but Frankie and Expert Eye came over the top and got them at the wire with a little something to spare. They’re past halfway, Catapult goes five wide round the turn, coming into the straight. Analyze It leads down the back, Lightning Spear just behind, Happily also close up. Off and running in the Breeders’ Cup Mile!They are at the gate for the Breeders’ Cup Mile. The one I like here is Happily, who got upset in the stalls at Ascot last time out and missed out on a run in the QEII when the starter let them go. Aidan O’Brien seemed rather put out about that earlier in the week and seems to fancy her to run a big race if she behaves herself at the stalls. Oscar Performance is still a solid 3-1 favourite here, but Analyze It, yet another Chad Brown-trained runner, is also attracting some support to around 8-1. He was fourth in the Grade One Turf Mile at Keeneland last time. The riders are up for the Mile, and heading out to the track. The parade is led by One Master and James Doyle, William Haggas’s second Breeders’ Cup runner after Queen Of Bermuda, fourth home in the Juvenile Turf Sprint yesterday. Peter Miller is in the interview room, waxing lyrical about Roy H: He’s a sweetheart, he’s a teddy bear, he’s a love. He’s a pleaser, and he’s given me more than I could ever give him. Even in the absence of Polydream, seven of the 13 runners in the Mile represent British or Irish stables: One Master, Happily, Expert Eye, I Can Fly, Lighting Spear, Gustav Klimt and Mustashry. The current favourite on the local tote, though, is Brian Lynch’s Oscar Performance, the winner of the Grade One Woodbine Mile last time out: Five down, four to go on the main card at the Breeders’ Cup. Back on to the turf in 25 minutes’ time, for the Mile, shorn of its favourite when Polydream was controversially ruled out by the vet but still a race with a deep challenge from Europe. Roy H is some sprinter, he had that race wrapped up with a furlong to run. That’s the second winner on the day for Peter Miller, who also trains Stormy Liberal. Both horses won their respective races last year - quite an achievement by their trainer. He was an outsider at Del Mar last year but Roy H was well backed here to become a dual Breeders’ Cup winner. He is only the second dual winner of this race, which has been on the Cup programme since its launch in 1984. Midnight Lute in 2007 and 2008 was the other horse to repeat, at Monmouth Park and Santa Anita.Round the turn, Roy H leads now, he’s going clear ... Whitmore missed the kick, Promises Fulfilled leads, Distinctive and Always Sunshine close up as Roy H takes closer order. Off and running in the Breeders’ Cup Sprint!Limousine Liberal - it’s the American equivalent of a champagne socialist - is also fancied at around 9-2, though he was only third behind Promises Fulfilled, another runner here, last time out.

Thank you for your company and onwards and upwards head England towards New Zealand. Adios. Something I didn’t flag earlier was New Zealand’s 69-31 victory over Japan, which, while interesting in itself was marked out by Kieran Read’s post-match comments...Owen Farrell has been speaking, firstly on that TMO referral. Asked if his heart was beating, he said...I imagine so, especially when they slow it down and slow motion it on the big screen. It was just a collision, I tried to wrap my hands around him but he was too quick. Was just proud of the fight the boys showed out there, how mentally tough we were. To come in only two points down after the territory and possession they had...We just made sure we were calm. We knew we had to put in a lot of work after half-time and we put ourselves in good positions after half-time and could have scored a few more points. It feels important that we’ve won to reward the bys for their performances off the field. We’ll work hard and get together to work on the details. We’ll have a lot of learning from this game, we could probably be a bit more clinical but we’ll enjoy this win and look forward to the test (against New Zealand). Lots of love for England No 8 Mark Wilson who’s been named Man of the Match. Wilson made 11 carries (only Daly had more for England with 12) and did a hell of a lot unseen work off the ball, completing 13 tackles. Had the result gone the other way, De Allende would unquestionably be collecting that accolade. The South Africa centre was a monster: 72 metres from 15 carries and five defenders beaten. And here’s Michael Aylwin’s match report from CardiffIf you want to catch up on events at the Principality Stadium as Wales beat Scotland 21-10, my colleague Tom Bassam has you covered...South Africa captain Siya Kolisi, who’s being way too complimentary but it’s still nice of him... We made it tough for ourselves, we didn’t make the most of opportunities, but England played very well today. We were our own enemies. We stuck to our plan but we didn’t execute and that’s the toughest part about it. But I thought England did well, with all their injuries and disruption in the week so credit to coach Eddie and Dylan Hartley. We’re still learning, still building but it’s really tough to lose like this. Dylan Hartley didn’t look *as* overjoyed as Jones but is, “proud of the boys”, “it wasn’t a pretty game but it was a winning game” and says Farrell’s challenge was a “good, physical tackle” ... The celebrations tell their own tale as England will now want, and need, this result to be transformative. They were allowed to hang on, their defence, it should be said, was also much better after the break. It’s a tough old Test match, we had players out on their feet. A real show of resistance. A lot of toughness in our play. We just stuck at it, stayed in the arm wrestle, did the simple things well and try and keep them on the back foot. The game just broke up, we weren’t quite able to take advantage of some good positions...Our young guys did exceptionally well, Hepburn, Benny Moon, Mercer and Jack Nowell - great effort. We’re going to prepare well and we can’t wait to play New Zealand, they’re the best in the world so let’s bring it on. Well, well, well, they dragged that one out but a fine second-half effort from England, playing the percentages and winning some territory, to disrupt South Africa, while the Boks own inexperience might have told with some rookie decisions on their part. That’s England’s captain there ... but bizarrely the referee thinks it’s a “clear collision” 80min: Williams smashed it out of play and England celebrated but the referee is checking a hit by Farrell on Esterhuizen which looked dangerously like a shoulder charge.79min: But Farrell rip it clear from De Jager and Care kicks long towards halfway. South Africa lineout in what will surely be the final passage of play. 78min: England now defending after another De Allende (sorry, he wasn’t replaced) break through midfield. The Boks getting closer and closer. 77min: Pollard misses! Stuck well but the ball was always drifting to the right and it just touches the upright. He had the distance but the accuracy was just off. Charlie Ewels is on for Shields. All of England’s bench is on. Elton Jantjies has come on for Van Zyl. 76min: South Africa drove the scrum forward and they earn a penalty, a couple metres into England territory. The No 10 signals to the posts. 75min: Frustration for England as they had quick ball from Care into Ford who tried to cut around the back of De Allende but Pollard put in a fine tackle. South Africa win the ball back and have a scrum right on halfway. 73min: In amongst that George Ford replaced Te’o, so Farrell has shifted to inside centre and we have the dream Ford-Farrell-Slade axis. Farrell puts England back in the lead, 5m inside the touchline and bang on the 22. Over to you, South Africa.71min: South Africa scrum on their own 5m line and England win a penalty as that new Bok front row buckles with the Red Rose twisting the set-piece. It’s close but a very tight angle. 70min: What on earth was that? England stretching South Africa, breaks all over the place. The ball is worked to the left to Brad Shields who has the line in sight but as he steps infield, with Ashton in support, the flanker bizarrely chucks it forward, attempting a speculative one-handed off-load. 69min: Danny Care has replaced Youngs and Harry Williams for Sinckler in the front row. South Africa have brought on Lood de Jager, Wilco Louw and Thomas Du Toit for captain Kolisi and props Malherbe and Kitshoff. Pollard nudges South Africa back into the lead with a mighty kick.66min: A flurry of replacements from both sides there, including Chris Ashton on for Nowell. Will update in a minute as South Africa have a penalty on halfway and Pollard going for the posts, which is a different approach to what the Boks were adopting in the first 40 minutes. 63min: What a counter-attack from England! May gathered Pollard’s kick ahead deep in his own half, weaved his way to halfway before popping the ball out to Nowell who took it to the 22. Kruis carried it on and then Daly punched another hole down the right. Still with the hosts. 61min: Just short from Farrell, 10m in from the touchline and around 40m+ out. The ball kissing the front of the posts. 60min: England have another penalty here with Whitely all over Itoje on a lineout. Farrell stepping up and it’s very kickable.59min: South Africa try-scorer Nkosi is replaced by Andre Esterhuizen who moves to inside centre, De Allende to 13 and Kriel to the right wing.Was about to publish this from Iain Young just before that Itoje break... which kind of renders it a little out of date (sorry, Iain). Still, the point stands when relating to the first 50 minutes. Obviously, the Premiership mantra of it’s “not losing is more important than going for the win” is showing. 57min: Dylan Hartley’s standard departure sees Jamie George brought on. Farrell is now England captain. Hartley has had a good game. 55min: My word, the momentum has changed now. Farrell looked to pass to his left on halfway, Pollard and Kriel followed his eyes and he broke into a pocket of space before the ball found it’s way to Daly via Slade. Unfortunately the full-back couldn’t quite work it out to May in space but this is much, much better from England. 54min: England concede a penalty with the Boks slightly penned in their 22, with referee Gardner unhappy with their work at the maul. Hartley warned. 53min: And then there’s Itoje to further energise that Twickenham crowd! Pumping those legs to power through midfield before it takes two defenders to bring him down. 52min: Brilliant from May who leapt to palm Youngs’ box kick into Sinckler’s path. Farrell kicks downfield and now it’s South Africa forced to defend in their own 22. The atmosphere has changed. Was officially measured at 46m and Daly cleared that with room to spare. 50min: Penalty to England on halfway and up steps Daly...48min: Credit to Nowell there who was in a 1v1 duel with De Allende, the South Africa centre holding the ball in his left hand and constantly fending the wing off with his right but the Exeter man managed to win the knock on. 47min: It didn’t last long, though, and the Boks are on the attack again. England win it back, all Farrell can do is kick it downfield and then we’re treated to some fine feet from Willemse who carries the ball back to halfway. 45min: England in South Africa’s 22! The Boks surrender the ball, again via a dodgy Marx lineout throw, and Daly smashes it downfield. Nkosi recovered but was tackled by Nowell. Some England ball and the crowd is cheering. Unbelievable scenes. 43min: A quick burst down their left wing and South Africa have England on the back foot again. Dyantyi was onto De Allende pass and chipped over the top but the bounce wasn’t kind allowing Daly to boot clear. Boks on the move ...42min: Tom Curry limps off for England and is replaced by Zac Mercer for his first cap. 42min: A replacement for South Africa with the massive figure of Eben Etzebeth off with an arm injury and the massive figure of RG Snyman on in his place. As England pass the ball around in midfield with little success or territory, a reminder you can check out what’s happening at the Principality Stadium with my colleague Tom Bassam here...Will England change anything? I guess George Ford is an obvious choice to bring a bit of unorthodoxy into their playmaking but, then again, they’ll have to get the ball to him. Anyway, Ford stays on the bench and the only change is in the front row with new cap Alec Hepburn off and Exeter teammate Ben Moon on for his international debut.Just to clarify that lack of action inside the South Africa 22. England got the ball into the red zone once, a lineout, which they then lost. It’s been a long, old 40 minutes but, as difficult as it’s been, South Africa will be slightly perturbed the advantage is just two points. All that ball, possession and metres gained, they should be at least two scores up. From England’s point of view, they’ve managed to dodge a bullet in that half. Down to 14 men and leaking penalties, South Africa somehow did manage to score in the 10 minutes Maro Itoje was off the field. Malcolm Marx, you are a very naughty boy. The hosts have barely been inside the Bok 22 ... I’m not sure they have once, in fact ... and have been gifted two penalties to ensure they’re in this contest but there are plenty of ominous signs. Pollard is orchestrating everything, in hand and with his boot, while De Allende has been excellent, Dyantyi lively and that collection of loose forwards have been quietly going about their business. England are still in this, of course, but they need to get their hands on the ball, starting with being more aggressive and pro-active in defence too many South Africa possessions are seeing them crossing the gainline. 40min: More danger from De Allende towards the end of the half. Willemse attempts a kick over the top which Nowell has to chase down and put out of touch. Peeep, there’s the whistle. 39min: We’re approaching half-time with Daly doing what he’s done for much of the first 40 minutes and slamming a kick up to halfway. No risk taken with the ball in hand. Exemplary from Farrell who gets England to within two points. Somehow. 36min: England enjoy some possession, attempting a few set moves but Kriel made a big hit on Slade and the ball very nearly found Dyantyi. However, there was an offside in all of that and Farrell has a chance from just inside halfway.  De Allende and Du Toit were punching holes in the England defence. Then De Allende makes another break down the left, constantly crossing the gainline. The ball is worked to the left where May does well to briefly hold everything up. But on the next possession, Whitely just flicks a pass to Nkosi, drawing Daly in, and the South Africa wing crosses just inside the touchline. Pollard misses the conversion, though. 29min: South Africa win the scrum against the head, Pollard tries *that* pass again but Slade is wise to it and comes within fingertips of making an interception and having a clear run through. A knock on but it probably saved a try. 28min: A beautiful flat pass from Pollard (he’s playing so well) sends De Allende crashing through midfield again. But South Africa can’t build on that, with Etzebeth conceding possession. 27min: Tackle count is England - 544 to South Africa - 191, which tells you the story of the match so far. Meanwhile, England collapse a scrum and Pollard plants another into touch, just 5m out but Marx’s throw again is way too long and the hosts recover to clear. 25min: But England withstand the catch and drive off the lineout, win a scrum and Itoje is back on the field. Storm successfully weathered. 24min: Possession is all with the Boks through the phases with Kriel and De Allende doing a lot of the carrying. Daly briefly clears but Pollard comes again. The ball is passed out to Willemse who finds space beyond May in the corner and the winger is forced to catch and step out of touch.

Feels like the show is back on track after last week’s Halloween madness. Sadly the mad scoring endures - is it too much to ask for the judges to decide if technique matters? Faves this evening were Charles and Karen, Dr Ranj and Janette and Joe and Dianne, and I’m predicting Danny and Amy and Kate and Aljaz in tomorrow’s bottom two – or maybe Graeme and Oti? Even Lauren and AJ could be in trouble, it’s a hard one to call this evening. Scores: 7,9,9,9 - a total of 34 for Joe and Dianne. Bruno thought Joe was a lean and mean Paso Doble machine - some great lines and shapes. Craig thought it was a bit wooden at times, but he loved the routine. Darcey thought it was dramatic and powerful, although there were moments when his arms went awry. Shirley goes in for another hug, because that’s how she and Joe roll now. Not weird at all.OK I already love this, just for Joe’s terrifying Paso face. He’s not here to play, is he? It’s a commanding performance, albeit a bit wobbly and lacking strength in places – not sure those sit-ups have paid off. Some nice Spanish line out of hold, but a bit wooden in places. Great effort though, and quite the finish to tonight’s show.And FINALLY, it’s JOE AND DIANNE! This week they’re dancing the Paso Doble to ‘Pompeii’ by Bastille. Oh my goodness, what a song to finish on, it’s a HUGE tune. On paper this is going to be amazing, but we haven’t seen Joe do anything other than goofy and charming so far, and that is NOT going to cut it in a Paso. You’re a fellow member of the North Wilts massive, Joe, now is the time to let all that repressed anger out. Think about how long it’s taken to make the A350 round Chippenham a dual carriageway they’ve been doing it since before you were BORN, and it’s still not finished. CHANNEL THE FURY.6,7,7,8 - a total of 28 for Charles and Karen, after weeks of 25. Good work.Shirley thought it was genuine and sincere with wonderful timing, although she’d like to see more glide. Bruno thought it was charming and Charles’ musically has improved enormously. Craig thought there was too much rise and fall and his fleckerl was flat-footed, but he loved Charles’ acting. Darcey loved the storytelling but Charles lost his frame on occasion. So Charles leaves a half-drunk pint in the pub to dance with Karen, and it’s all rather lovely. Nice flow and rise and fall from Charles, and he makes this look quite effortless. I think that’s probably my favourite dance of the night so far, which is unexpected.Also what a gorgeous rendition of Piano Man. Good work, Dave Arch singer. Only two left - time for CHARLES AND KAREN! This week they’re dancing the Viennese Waltz to ‘Piano Man’ by Billy Joel. This is a lovely song for a Waltz, and I badly want Charles and Karen to do it justice.I forgot to include incongruous training room poppies in this week’s Bingo. Just as well, really.Scores: 9,10,9,10 - a total of 38 for Faye and Giovanni. Sure, why not.Darcey is having a hot flush - she loved the intensity, passion and precision. Shirley loved the splashes of colour but Faye’s frame jiggled a bit and her feet were a bit turned out. Bruno thought it was tighter than Craig’s girdle, and Faye didn’t miss a beat. Craig thought the cube wasn’t required - if they’d got rid of that it would have been worth a ten. Eh?OMG Faye looks incredible. They’re dancing in a box, albeit not technically a phone box. Sharp footwork and plenty of attitude from Faye - nice staccato and good Tango face. Not sure if her knees are meant to be that bent, but enjoyed that. Next up it’s FAYE AND GIOVANNI! This week they’re dancing the Tango to ‘Call Me’ by Blondie. I love the idea of a Tango to this song, it’s entirely fierce and hopefully Faye From Steps will bring both barrels. Extra drink for a prop phone box or literal phone-themed dancing. Scores: 9,10,10,10 - a total of 39 for Ashley and Pasha. Gets kind of dull when they’re dishing out tens in Week 7. Where does she go from here?Craig thought that was a proper Foxtrot - no tricks or gimmicks, and he loved it. Darcey thought Ashley made that her own, and Shirley thought it was exquisite, classic Foxtrot that she couldn’t find fault with. Bruno thought it was classic Hollywood glamour - delicious and flawless.Strictly lampost! This is splendidly cheesy and so sweet my teeth are hurting. The dancing is old-school Hollywood and lovely, despite Ashley and Pasha’s outfits clashing horribly. Good work Pashley, you smashed that. Time for ASHLEY AND PASHA! This week they’re dancing the Foxtrot to ‘Orange Coloured Sky’ by Natalie Cole. This will be an outstanding Foxtrot, because Ashley is entirely incapable of having a bad week and giving us the journey we all crave. It is what it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b8a956557c086ea0ee330e36ca75b3d86c376f7/0_211_3156_1893/master/3156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7f979605fdc8d9ef7831d7482631b63","title":"georgia governor stacey abrams brian kemp","story":"Stacey Abrams would be the first female African American governor. Brian Kemp has pitched his tent with TrumpHis thinning hair dusted with grey, his white shirt open at the collar, Barack Obama was met by a deafening roar and nostalgic chants of: “Yes, he can!” In front of thousands of people crammed into a college basketball arena, back on the campaign trail in a way he never expected, he sounded hoarse.“My voice is starting to go,” he admitted. “So you just got to pay real close attention.”It might have been a metaphor for Obama’s weakening legacy. But the 44th president’s words were as trenchant as ever.“The consequences of any of us staying home really are profound because America’s at a crossroads,” he warned. “The healthcare of millions of people is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. But maybe most of all, the character of our country is on the ballot.”It was not meant to be like this. America’s first black president hoped to steer the nation on an upward trajectory. Then came Donald Trump, a man endorsed by white supremacists and the breathing embodiment of everything Obama is not. On Tuesday, these two radically opposing visions of “the character of our country” will collide at the ballot box. Georgia is ground zero.The deep south, socially conservative state should be solid Republican territory, but the race for governor is anything but. Brian Kemp, a staunch conservative who has embraced Trump’s hard line on immigration and wields guns in his campaign ads, is neck and neck with Stacey Abrams, a progressive African American woman. Victory for a Democrat here, of all places, would deliver the most devastating rebuke to Trumpism.Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “If Stacey Abrams wins, this is maybe going to be the most sharp message that the racial animus Donald Trump has called forth in America has limitations. The question for Republicans will be: is Trump a liability?”The elemental clash of two Americas, played out between a black woman and white man, was laid bare during the final full week of campaigning. On one side: Obama, billionaire media star Oprah Winfrey and Abrams, bidding to become the first female African American governor in US history. On the other: Donald Trump (who holds a rally in Georgia on Sunday), his pious vice-president Mike Pence and Kemp, bidding to become the 83rd white man in a row to occupy the governor’s mansion.At a Kemp rally with Pence in Savannah on Thursday, the crowd was exclusively white. At Abrams’ event with Obama 24 hours later, it was majority black and appreciably younger. In Savannah, the room was silent as a tomb as a lone violinist played a wordless version of The Star-Spangled Banner until someone began to spontaneously murmur the closing lines: “O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?” and others joined in. In Atlanta, a bespectacled African American boy in a smart school blazer sang the anthem and was cheered rapturously.Abrams and Kemp personify a year in which Democrats are fielding a record number of women and people of color while Republicans are ossifying, a party dominated by white men. Among voters, African American women, in particular, are likely to be the driving force if Democrats flip the 23 seats they need to secure a majority in the House of Representatives (the Senate is expected to remain in Republican hands).The fact they are duelling in Georgia further raises the stakes. The state was a bulwark of the Confederacy – a role immortalised in Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind – and carries the scars of slavery, segregation and hundreds of lynchings. It was also the birthplace of Martin Luther King and a crucible of the civil rights struggle. Like Obama’s win in the 2008 presidential election, Abrams would be writing a new page in history – perhaps all the more remarkable in the current climate.Winfrey, who like Abrams grew up in Mississippi, recalled this history on Thursday as she joined the campaign trail, knocking on doors and speaking at rallies.“I’m here today because of the men and because of the women who were lynched, who were humiliated, who were discriminated against, who were suppressed, who were repressed and oppressed, for the right for the equality at the polls,” she told an ecstatic audience in Marietta. “And I want you to know that their blood has seeped into my DNA, and I refuse to let their sacrifices be in vain. I refuse.”Kemp and Pence finished the day in Savannah, settled in 1733 by British colonists and spared from destruction during the civil war. The crowd of a few hundred, some sporting Make America Great Again hats, bowed their heads in a pre-rally prayer.“That’s what I love about the south,” Deborah Stautberg said to her friend Kathleen Jakubowski. “You pray before football games and ceremonies. You don’t find that in the north.”Stautberg, 57, holding a “Kempgovernor” sign, said Abrams would be wrong for the state. “She’s not my candidate. Too liberal: she wants expansion of Medicaid, free education, big government, open borders. Not a good idea.”Jakubowski, 43, a vessel planner in the maritime industry, rejected the notion of backing Abrams because she is black or a woman. “That bugs the shit out of me,” she said. “I don’t care what your gender is. I don’t care what the colour of your skin is. I care about what kind of job you’re going to do.”Jakubowski was also a fan of the president “He’s a New Yorker, I’m a New Yorker. I love him. Sometimes the way he says things is very New York but he’s doing pretty much everything he said he was going to do.”Stautberg rejoined: “We haven’t had that in a politician for a long time.”Kemp, 54, described the gubernatorial election as “a battle for the soul of our state”. He claimed Abrams was running a “dishonest” and “radical” campaign that would give public benefits to undocumented immigrants and lead to a government takeover of healthcare.“With your vote and your support we can end this craziness,” he said.Pence heaped praise on the candidate as a backer of the Trump agenda. And he said: “I heard Oprah’s in town today. And I heard Will Ferrell was going door-to-door the other day. Well, I’d like to remind Stacey and Oprah and Will Ferrell, I’m kind of a big deal, too.”The vice-president added “a message for all Stacey Abrams’ liberal Hollywood friends: this ain’t Hollywood. This is Georgia.”The cute remark inadvertently revealed Pence to be out of touch with the state’s booming film and TV production industry, which has made hits such as Black Panther, s of the Galaxy and The Walking Dead and been dubbed “the Hollywood of the south” – a measure of the state’s cultural, economic and social transformation.But it went down well with this audience. Michael Sheppard, 36, who described himself as “old-school white” and claimed direct descent from Confederate general Robert E Lee and Robert the Bruce, said he would vote for Kemp.Asked if his slavery analogy might be regarded as unfortunate in the context of Abrams’ historic candidacy, Sheppard, 36, a small business owner, insisted: “It’s unfortunate for her advocating slavery because she doesn’t understand the policies she promotes.”He also questioned the symbolism of Abrams’ candidacy. “If you’re going to pick people on race and gender, why would I, as a white man, pick a black woman? She’s got the same ideas that make Obama a joke, the same ideas that make Hillary Clinton a joke, the same ideas that make CNN a joke.”The race between Abrams, a Yale law graduate and former Democratic leader in the state house whom Trump has branded “not qualified”, and Kemp has become a flashpoint in the nationwide fight over voting rights. Georgia has one of the country’s strictest voter ID laws, which Republicans claim are needed to ensure no one votes illegally.Curiously, as Georgia’s secretary of state, Kemp oversees its elections. Activists sued to block him from throwing out more than 50,000 voter registration applications put on hold under the state’s “exact match” law, requiring personal information to perfectly match state databases (a spelling mistake or misplaced hyphen can be pounced on). Jimmy Carter, a former US president and Georgia governor, called on Kemp to resign his post. South African comedian Trevor Noah observed: “That is some Africa-level shit right there!”Larry Jacobs said: “You’ve got a candidate in Stacey Abrams who’s an African American woman but has built a reputation for working across the aisle with Republicans. She’s not running as a fiery civil rights leader she’s running as someone who will make Georgia work.“The response has been a blatant effort at old-school tampering with the election and stopping the African American vote. This is not theoretical we’re seeing it play out in real time. It’s like the 1950s all over again but what’s different about 2018 is the attention it’s receiving and how it’s become a political liability.”The tactic looks set to backfire, he added: “The old south is changing and the old tactics of racism are no longer acceptable. Georgia is putting on display the costs of playing the old political games. Independent suburban voters are rejecting that. While Donald Trump’s racial approach in the closing days of the campaign clearly excites some voters, there are large parts of the country that have no interest.”On Friday, a bus rolled into the historically black Savannah State University, bearing branding that said “Black voters matter”, “Voting power” and “The south is rising”. About a dozen volunteers boarded, ready to tour black neighbourhoods in a last-ditch voter awareness effort. Local organiser Amanda Hollowell, 39, warned that suppression could cost Abrams the election. Door-to-door leafleting, she said, can only do so much to combat widespread misinformation.If it does not, and if Abrams prevails, “the emotion would be hope”, she added. “I wouldn’t be elated, I wouldn’t be dancing and screaming for joy because, as we’ve seen with President Obama, you can have a great thing and then ruin it. But I would see it as a step forward for the erse leadership we need.”Later, at the Abrams rally in Atlanta, the mood was upbeat as the crowd listened to My Shot from Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical Hamilton and danced to hip-hop. One supporter wore a T-shirt emblazoned with Obama’s face and defiant words: “Still my president.” Speakers included former attorney general Eric Holder, who declared: “The system is rigged. The system is rigged. The system is rigged! There has been a systematic effort to cripple our democracy and disenfranchise those who do not subscribe to certain political views.”Local congressman John Lewis told how he endured beatings and imprisonment during the civil rights struggle to win the right to vote. When Georgia turns blue, he said, “they will not be able to hold us down”. Fired up as he moved about the stage, the 78-year-old led the crowd in a chorus of “Vote! Vote! Vote!”, exhorting: “I’m asking you to go and vote like you’ve never voted before. We have to vote.”Abrams, 44, smiling and waving, emerged to cheers and chants of “Stacey! Stacey!” She said: “We are in this together. Our shared story as Georgians is stronger than any fears that may seek to ide us.” She recalled founding an organisation to register votes and defend voting rights.“We must be the change we want to see,” she said.Her supporters are ready. Karen Wood, who stands on busy street corners with a sign urging people to vote, said: “It’s all about women right now. To be frank, I think white conservative men are getting scared so they’re trying to apply fear to us and suppress our voices and suppress our votes. Stacey is giving us our voices back.”Asked what an Abrams victory would mean to her, Wood, 57, co-founder of a not-for-profit organisation, replied: “Representation. It means a girl like myself or my daughter, any girl of any creed, colour or religion, can achieve that type of office. Representation means, ‘Hey, there’s a chance for me!’”On Friday night, Obama struggled at times to make his own voice heard. But his message could not have been clearer as America, having lurched from Obamaism to Trumpism, gets its first opportunity for a course correction. Railing against elected leaders who constantly ide and lie, he said: “For every two steps of progressive change that we make, we usually add a step back in conservative retrenchment.“Every time we pull ourselves closer to that founding ideal, that all of us are created equal, endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, whenever we try to make that real, the status quo has pushed back …“Making this country live up to its creed has never been easy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1766568c158bc12f912b7fedfb1646dbf9502dee/289_0_1759_1055/master/1759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cade1a8c1c24b2ba78937c5c9cc0a71","title":"idlib jeremy hunt syria russia turkey","story":"Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told that west’s help will be vital if Russia breaks ceasefireThe head of Syria’s White Helmet volunteers has told Britain’s foreign secretary that the west must do more to protect millions of civilians still in extreme danger, and warned that reconstruction should not begin without justice or accountability.Raed al-Saleh said Moscow’s record of broken promises meant he had little confidence in a ceasefire brokered between Russia and Turkey in September. The agreement halted a planned advance on Idlib, one of the last parts of Syria still outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad, and currently home to more than 3 million people.But similar agreements in other parts of Syria have proved a prelude to siege, brutal bombardment and eventual evacuation, and Saleh said he wanted to remind Jeremy Hunt that western support was vital to save lives.“We would emphasise that we cannot rely on the Russians or trust guarantees provided by them, because we have seen how their commitments were fake in previous de-escalation zones in Homs, in Daraa, in eastern Ghouta,” Saleh said before his meeting with Hunt last week. “So we need more commitment from the western world to protect the Syrian people.”Western powers, such as Turkey, have strategic, as well as humanitarian, incentives to avoid an all-out assault on Idlib. Previous offensives have ended with mass evacuations, as opposition supporters retreated to other parts of shrinking territory, but Idlib is the last major stronghold. If it is attacked or falls, residents will have to surrender to Assad’s forces or try to cross the border into Turkey.“A military offensive means a disaster, and not only for Idlib,” Saleh said. “It will have an impact on neighbouring countries, as it would push hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of people to march to the border trying to escape.”Turkey already hosts more than 3.5 million Syrians and has closed its border to refugees. But a huge surge of desperate civilians fleeing might pose a serious challenge to that closed-door policy some among the exodus might also try to push onwards towards Europe.Saleh hopes that a longer-term ceasefire deal might help to reverse the flow of Syrians abroad. The White Helmets have used the weeks of calm since the September deal to start small-scale reconstruction, clearing rubble to build a park, and restoring power lines. “We believe there is very important work to be done on stabilisation, with the potential to reduce the scale of the refugee crisis, by improving life conditions inside Syria, and maybe inspiring people to return, and paving the way for reconstruction,” said Saleh.But he warned against western support for larger, national reconstruction programmes, unless there is justice for the dead and jailed. In August, Vladimir Putin urged the international community to start rebuilding Syria so refugees can return, and there have been calls to speed up efforts to broker an end to the war, even if that means leaving Assad in power.But the fears and frustrations that drove the civil war have only been exacerbated by it, Saleh said. Although Isis atrocities dominated international news for years, Assad and his allies are responsible for the vast majority of civilian deaths.“There are parties currently who want to try to claim that it’s time now for reconstruction and constitutional reform, as if the crisis had ended, which is not true,” Saleh said, laying out his message for Hunt.“We want to send a message that there is a need for accountability first in order to build peace. We cannot practically work on reconstruction and constitutional reform if there is no political solution, and there is no transitional justice and accountability mechanisms.”The White Helmets have been hailed for their humanitarian search and rescue work on the frontlines of Syria’s brutal civil war. But Saleh said they are worried about the impact of extensive campaigns of disinformation, which have falsely claimed the group stage rescue efforts and attack scenes, and that they have links to extremist groups.“Imagine when someone is putting his life in danger to rescue others, then he hears that people are calling them a bad guy or terrorist. That over time may affect the morale of the volunteers.”“We are very keen to keep the support of ordinary people around the world. The disinformation campaign causes distraction and affects how people view and understand the situation.”After the meeting on Thursday, Hunt paid tribute to the courage of the White Helmets and said Britain, which helped arrange asylum for hundreds of members trapped by a summer offensive, would continue to support the group.“The White Helmets risked life and limb to save over 115,000 lives during the Syrian conflict, despite attacks at the hands of the Syrian regime and the Russian military,” Hunt said. “The UK is proud to stand behind them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af00bbefcf399e3dee6b941e0e9f68d6e553d706/0_665_2782_1669/master/2782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=445c353ff08d89ab2bd16c29ae72693a","title":"leo varadkar brexit has undermined the good friday agreement","story":"Irish PM says process has strained relations between UK and IrelandBrexit has undermined the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland and has strained relations between Britain and Ireland, the Irish prime minister has said.In an interview with RTÉ on Saturday morning, Leo Varadkar said Ireland was about to enter a difficult period because of the impact Brexit would have on the economy.He indicated that a Brexit deal would give renewed impetus to parties in Northern Ireland to reach an agreement to restore devolved government in the region, 22 months after the Stormont assembly collapsed.“Brexit has undermined the Good Friday agreement and is fraying the relationship between Britain and Ireland,” he told the Marian Finucane show. “Anything that pulls the communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday agreement, and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship.”He said if there was some clarity in the next couple of weeks or months there would be “a window of opportunity to get the assembly going again”.He went on to reiterate his pledge that there would be no return to a hard border in Ireland whatever the outcome of Brexit negotiations.On Friday the British and Irish governments signalled that there could be a breakthrough on the Irish border impasse within weeks, which would pave the way to a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, and David Lidington, the UK Cabinet Office minister, said there had been progress in negotiations that could resolve the deadlock and produce a deal this month.At the same time, the Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, indicated a that deal was in the offing after meeting the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, in Belfast.“Goodness, we have been here on a number of occasions and I think we are close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland. That is what we want,” said Foster, whose party less than a month ago threatened to withdraw support for the Conservative government if the Brexit deal involved a border in the Irish Sea.Hopes of a breakthrough have risen in the last week after it emerged that the EU had proposed a new UK-wide customs arrangement in addition to a backstop or insurance policy in relation to the Irish border.Under the proposal, the UK would operate a “bare bones” customs arrangement, with the EU applying a common external tariff on imports from outside the EU, as is currently the case."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"capital ideas for dublin no 1 put someone in charge","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

The figure is up from 6,181 children at the end of January.A quarter of the children, 1,607, have been waiting more than a year to see a psychologist. Of those waiting more than a year for help with their mental health, 109 of them are under the age of four .James Browne, Fianna Fail mental health spokesman, who obtained the figures from the Health Service Executive (HSE) through a parliamentary question, said they should act as “a wake up call” for Mr Harris and his Cabinet colleagues.“These lengthy waits are not only completely unacceptable from a medical point of view they are causing immense stress and anxiety to the children and families trapped on the list,” he said.“This data is yet another illustration of the persistent crisis in the provision of mental health services for children.”Cork and Kerry — which includes Minister of State for Mental Health Jim Daly’s constituency — are the worst affected areas in the growing backlog. Some 527 children across the two counties have been waiting more than a year to be seen by a psychologist.South east Dublin, Dun Laoghaire and Wicklow (where Mr Harris is based) have the most favourable waiting times in the country, according to the new figures. No child has been waiting for more than 39 weeks across the three areas.After Cork and Kerry, the longest waiting times are in north Dublin, where 297 children are waiting more than a year.In Galway, Roscommon and Mayo 239 children are waiting more than a year as are 196 children in Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary and 133 children in South Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford.There are 74 children on year-long waiting lists in Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Louth and Meath and 72 in Kildare, West Wicklow and south and west Dublin.Some 69 children are waiting more than 12 months for an appointment with a psychologist in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan.“Early intervention is critical when dealing with susceptible children and teenagers.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The last week has been a “horrendous” one for Traveller women, a playwright and member of the Traveller community has told a conference marking achievements for women since some in Ireland were granted the vote 100 years ago. Rosaleen McDonagh was speaking at the ‘Deeds not words? Assessing a century of change’ conference at the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks in Dublin on Saturday.Academics, historians and writers delivered papers on topics such as the depiction of the female body in 1960s women’s magazines, women’s healthcare and the design of female uniforms for the Army in the 1980s. While she did not mention any candidate in the recent presidential election by name, Ms McDonagh said the contest had been “a reminder of the struggle to challenge racism”.She said: “It’s the kids - the small ones, the teenagers, the vulnerable ones that get vilified.”Presidential candidate Peter Casey, who came second when the votes were counted last week, caused controversy during the campaign with his comments about Travellers, including his denial of Traveller ethnicity.He repeatedly rejected charges that his comments were racist, saying: “There is not a racist bone in my body.”Meanwhile, Ms McDonagh said when the media moved on to a different story, Travellers were left with the “debris of trying to instil a sense of pride in our children and young people”.“We see ourselves as bold and brilliant. We survived policies of assimilation. Our culture is fluid. We are proud and strong. We are erse,” she said. Ms McDonagh said the values of “self-determination, equality, non-discrimination and solidarity” were “central to our work as anti-racist feminists”. She continued: “The burden is too heavy to bear - you all need to challenge the racists - not on social media but in their own families. In your workplaces, in the gym, with your neighbours, with your friends, with your families. Have those difficult conversations everywhere as often as you can.”Ms McDonagh said there was talk about a “national conversation”, and that conversation was “about me and my community and my ethnicity”. She added: “If there’s going to be such a public conversation, I would hope we won’t start naming and shaming Travellers.”Issues such as rural crime and antisocial behaviour affected the Traveller community also, she said. “The rules for a national conversation must include the topic and fallout of both inidual and institutional racism.“I would also be bold enough to say Traveller women and Travellers of all ages have been having that conversation for the last 40 years, but it seems to be happening in a vacuum.”She said so-called feminist “waves” failed to realise the impact of racism and discrimination on some women’s lives. Traveller women were also dealing with issues of sexism from within their own community as well as sexism from the wider settled community, she said. “Dealing with racism is an everyday reality. Traveller women are the custodians of culture, not subordinates. Respect for our identity is an ongoing struggle.”Before she began delivering her paper, Ms McDonagh told those in attendance it had been a “horrendous week for Traveller women”. “I’m exhausted,” she said. It was not a word she liked to use, she said, but the period had been “really ugly”. “Sometimes the fallout of public displays of racism mean we as women lock ourselves away to protect our families, our children and our partners,” she said. “We need to remind ourselves of the women who are not here and the Irish women who have been written out of history,” Ms McDonagh added. This included deaf and disabled women. This was a “whole other area” of Irish feminist history that needed to be explored and aired, she said. Ms McDonagh said she wanted to add one “celebratory” note: “As Irish women we have had several national conversations and we have won them all.”A performer and a member of Aosdána, Ms McDonagh is currently a PhD candidate at Northumbria University. Closing the conference, Labour Party Senator Ivana Bacik highlighted the commemorations this year of the 100th anniversary of some women in Ireland getting the vote. She said it had not been a short campaign but a “lengthy and gruelling” campaign and was “the culmination of many decades of suffragettes and suffragists”. The suffrage campaign was not just about winning the vote, but was also about equality for women more generally. She noted there was clearly a lot more to be done to bring women forward in politics, but noted that the quota introduced in 2012 had succeeded in increasing the number of women in the Dáil to 22 per cent.The event was organised by the Education and Outreach Department of the National Museum.

Ms Phelan said that scandals - such as those in An Garda Síochána in recent times - will keep happening unless there is proper accountability across the public sector. She said that Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe’s life had been ruined yet there were no consequences for others in the force for their actions against him. The Disclosures Tribunal last month found former Garda commissioner Martin Callinan conducted a “campaign of calumny” against Mr McCabe, who retired from the force last week.Mr Justice Peter Charleton, the chair of the Tribunal, said he did not accept Mr Callinan’s denials of ever smearing Mr McCabe.Ms Phelan was speaking at the Labour Party conference in Ballsbridge, Dublin, where she was presented with an award for bravery in recognition of her work revealing issues with the CervicalCheck programme.Awards were also presented to Stephen Teap, husband of Irene Teap, who died of cervical cancer in 2017, and Lorraine Walsh, one of the 221 patients caught up in the controversy.Labour’s health spokesman Alan Kelly presented the Jo Cox awards for bravery, which remember the British Labour MP who was shot and stabbed in the street in her constituency in the north of England shortly before the Brexit vote.Ms Phelan did not rule out getting involved in politics in the future. “No more than Stephen, I literally fell into this. It just happened. I wouldn’t have chosen this path but it has come my way and I feel so strongly about what I am doing and what I am trying to achieve that I will do whatever I have to do,” she said.“The fact that I am apolitical helps.

I wouldn’t rule it out but at the moment I am happy just to campaign from the outside because I find it very hard to toe a party political line.” Mr Teap and Ms Phelan both called for sanctions to be introduced for inidual medical practitioners who do not adhere to open disclosure. Mr Teap said measures currently being considered by Minister for Health Simon Harris need to be strengthened.“Back in May, when we first sat down with Simon Harris, talking about the Patient Safety Bill, it was all about putting sanctions in place on the iniduals. We see in the first draft of the Patient Safety Bill, that it is very, very soft touch. And we wouldn’t be very happy with it in its current format.”He added that “asking people to follow the policy doesn’t work” and that neither he nor Ms Phelan “want to see anyone being brought away in handcuffs or large fines”. “It is really just to focus the mind.”Ms Phelan settled a High Court action in April over the reading of her smear test.It later emerged that 221 women were not informed of an audit which revised their earlier, negative smear tests.The Limerick woman has consistently said she wants women to continue attending for smear tests and has also spoken of the importance of the HPV vaccine for preventing a range of cancers, including cervical cancer.The Scally report into the Cervical Check controversy, published in September, outlined failures by the State’s health services."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684594.1541188737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats gear up to try to win control of house of representatives","story":"In the final weekend before Americans will go to the polls and decide the make-up of the 116th United States Congress US President Donald Trump squared off against former president Barack Obama.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi: In public, Democrats are staying silent on whether they’ll support her. Photograph:  Erin SchaffNew York TimesThe corridors of Congress have been eerily quiet as the midterm elections approach.The usual churn of legislative activity on Capitol Hill is on hold as members of the House and Senate return to their constituencies to campaign, or in many cases help out fellow incumbents in tight election races around the country.On Tuesday,\u0026nbspAmericans will go to the polls and decide the make-up of the 116th United States Congress.Signs are that the Democrats are on track to wrest control of the 435-member House of Representatives from Republicans. Their path to the Senate is not so sure, with Republicans confident that they will retain control, or even increase their majority of one, with the help of victories in states where Democrat incumbents are running in Republican-leaning areas.Congress will reconvene in full session on November 13th, the Tuesday after the election. Members will then sit until the end of the year – a period known as the lame-duck session – when Republicans are likely to try to push through a raft of legislation, particularly if they lose their majority.The new members of Congress will take their seats in the first week of January.Already the prospect of a changing of the guard on Capitol Hill has prompted speculation about who will become the new kingmakers.The Democratic ranking members on some of the most important House committees look to be in line for the top jobs.Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who has been a leading advocate of Irish issues on the Hill for decades, for example, is expected to become the chair of the Ways and Means committee – a key committee in Congress.But the real interest will be in the new House speaker.Nancy Pelosi is widely expected to assume the role for the second time. She became the first female speaker of the house in 2007, before Democrats lost their majority in the 2010 midterms. But her presumed coronation is not without controversy.Many wonder if Pelosi, at 78, is the face of change that Democrats need as they try to define themselves after their shock defeat in the 2016 presidential election.Publicly, Democrats are keeping mum about whether they’ll support Pelosi, but there are rumblings of discontent. An NBC survey of Democratic candidates and current lawmakers in August found that 51 Democrats running for the House said they would not support her. This may not mean she is doomed, however – more than 63 Democrats opposed Pelosi in a closed-door meeting two years ago but the vast majority went on to vote for her as minority leader on the House floor.Even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28 year old who is expected to win New York’s 14th congressional district next week and who previously spoke of the need for a new direction in the upper echelons of the party, has dampened her criticism of the leadership in recent weeks.It is unclear if Pelosi will have a challenger when the Democratic caucus reconvenes in Washington later this month after the elections. Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, who challenged Pelosi for leadership two years ago, has not yet indicated if he will launch another bid.Pelosi has become the target of sustained attacks from Republicans in the run-up to the elections, as they try to align various Democratic candidates to the party’s senior House member, whom they perceive to be widely unpopular. Perhaps as a result, Pelosi has kept a relatively low profile, campaigning only in select areas and not visiting those where Democrats are contesting seats in Trump-supporting districts. Nonetheless, behind the scenes she has helped raise tens of millions of dollars for her party.In a move that many viewed as at worst reckless, at best tempting fate, Pelosi appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert this week and predicted that Democrats would “win the House”. A bemused Colbert shot back “Do you want to say that on Hillary’s fireworks barge that she cancelled?”, a reference to the aborted firework display that the Clinton campaign had planned for election night 2016. \u0026nbspWith the painful memories of 2016 still fresh in their minds, Democrats are not taking chances. Still, as a politician well-known for her caution, many aides remarked that Pelosi would not speak out of turn unless she had the polling to back up her predictions.With Democrats hoping to capitalise on the depth of anti-Trump feeling around the country, the House of Representatives appears to be their best shot at taking back power in Washington and beginning what they hope will be a march back to power in 2020.Will there be a backlash against Trump?

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Historical commemorations should happen organically. The future will see it balance itself out.”Dorothy L Sayers blue memorial plaque in Great James Street, LondonIt comes after he announced that there are too many blue plaques in general, claiming that some are erected at spots that have only a fleeting connection to the famous person in question.He added: “With regard to there being too many, there are often plaques to worthy people but sometimes for trivial reasons.”But English Heritage claims it only approves 12 legitimate nominations per year and has a panel of historians, including the University of Bristol’s Professor Ronald Hutton, responsible for approving each plaque.Although the charity is always open for suggestions, their revived push for women’s nominations comes in the centenary year of women’s suffrage.Anna Eavis, Curatorial Director and Secretary of the English Heritage Blue Plaques Panel said: “This year’s centenary of the first votes for women has brought about an increased urgency to rebalance the record of women’s contribution to history.“We really hope this enthusiasm will be translated into lots more nominations and ultimately more blue plaques for women.I think it\u0027s reasonable to expect that half of the nominations coming in could be for women.Of the 119 nominations English Heritage received from the public since 2016, a third were for women.The successful nominations include famous women like Noor Inayat Khan, renowned for her service in the Special Operations Executive in the Second World War and actress Margaret Lockwood.Their legitimacy has been scrutinised by the panel, who meet three times a year to draw up a shortlist.For English Heritage to even consider a candidate, at least 20 years must have passed since their death. Before the new plaques can be unveiled, the charity endeavours to identify the best locations and secure permissions for them.Their manufacture then takes months - the English Heritage plaques themselves are handmade and kiln-fired twice. The entire process from nomination to unveiling can  up to three years.Ms Eavis added: “The dominance of plaques to men reflects a historic blindness to both the role women have played in our society and the type of roles deemed worthy of celebration.“At English Heritage we’ve long recognised this and have been doing what we can to address it, but the blue plaques scheme relies on public nominations, and we need their help.”Please review our commenting policyStrictly Come Dancing 2018: week 7 - with two contestants injured, it could be a tough weekHelen Glover urges mothers to take up rowing - but says Tokyo 2020 is too soon for her Olympic returnDisabled BT engineer awarded £8,000 after receiving offensive \u0026#39pocket call\u0026#39 from managerAngela Merkel\u0026#39s CDU facing bitter battle as three front-runners compete for different visions for the partyComment: If the higher education market is to succeed, bad universities must be allowed to go bustComment: Wanted: a leader to cut through this painful procrastinationComment: We must stop creating new crimes to police and conditions to cureNHS forced to pay compensation to 1,200 staff worried they have been infected after needle prickZimbabwe government fails to keep inflation in check as post-Mugabe honeymoon endsTension as New Caledonians in idyllic south Pacific poised to vote on independence from FranceSouth Korean puppies head to UK as country turns on dog meat tradeMan fleeing \u0026#39aggressive\u0026#39 seals rescued from Scottish cliff face Unknown poem by Siegfried Sassoon discovered 50 years after he gifted it to schoolgirlRival auction houses to share research as authenticity of painting hangs in the balanceMayfair residents fight plans for bigger gigs at Hyde Park that they fear will ruin the neighbourhood Leicester City players hailed the \u0026#39bravest on the planet\u0026#39 by fans after heartfelt tributes at match to their billionaire ownerUS soldier killed in \u0026#39insider attack\u0026#39 in AfghanistanFrance’s relationship with the English language?

Their views are reflected in modern South Korea’s political and judicial systems which are progressively cracking down on the dog meat trade.A mother dog and her puppies were among 200 dogs recently rescued by Humane Society International from a South Korean farmIn May a new bill was introduced to the National Assembly that would remove the legal basis for factory-style mass breeding of dogs.Meanwhile in June, a court in Bucheon, a satellite city of the capital, Seoul, convicted the owner of a dog farm for killing animals without proper reason, in a ruling hailed by animal rights activists as a milestone in the fight against the dog meat trade. The rescue at the Gyeonggi-do farm in October was done in partnership with the owner who signed up to HSI’s pioneering programme to phase out the dog meat industry by helping farmers transition to more profitable and humane livelihoods.A UK-bound puppy rescued from a South Korean dog farm by HSIThe owner, Mr Lee, 71, who only wished to be identified by his surname, will transform his land into a medicinal herb farm, while the dogs he raised for human consumption will be flown to Canada, the UK, US and the Netherlands.“I’ve wanted to stop dog farming for a while but I didn’t know how to make it happen,” he said.HSI\u0027s Wendy Higgins, who helped close farm, said: “There is certainly momentum building within South Korea for an end to the dog meat trade, with very vocal animal groups exposing the cruelty and increasingly politicians also speaking out.“We’re seeing progress on a pretty rapid scale. And we see that reflected in our work with dog meat farmers too, as they are increasingly keen to explore ways to exit the trade due to a combination of dwindling profits and family pressure.”Please review our commenting policyStrictly Come Dancing 2018: week 7 - with two contestants injured, it could be a tough weekComment: The Government’s policy on electric cars is great news – if you’re an importer of petrol vehiclesHelen Glover urges mothers to take up rowing - but says Tokyo 2020 is too soon for her Olympic returnDisabled BT engineer awarded £8,000 after receiving offensive \u0026#39pocket call\u0026#39 from managerAngela Merkel\u0026#39s CDU facing bitter battle as three front-runners compete for different visions for the partyComment: If the higher education market is to succeed, bad universities must be allowed to go bustComment: Wanted: a leader to cut through this painful procrastinationComment: We must stop creating new crimes to police and conditions to cureNHS forced to pay compensation to 1,200 staff worried they have been infected after needle prickZimbabwe government fails to keep inflation in check as post-Mugabe honeymoon endsTension as New Caledonians in idyllic south Pacific poised to vote on independence from FranceBritish Plaque Trust accuses English Heritage of \u0026#39populist signalling\u0026#39 over call for more blue plaques for womenMan fleeing \u0026#39aggressive\u0026#39 seals rescued from Scottish cliff face Unknown poem by Siegfried Sassoon discovered 50 years after he gifted it to schoolgirlRival auction houses to share research as authenticity of painting hangs in the balanceMayfair residents fight plans for bigger gigs at Hyde Park that they fear will ruin the neighbourhood Leicester City players hailed the \u0026#39bravest on the planet\u0026#39 by fans after heartfelt tributes at match to their billionaire ownerUS soldier killed in \u0026#39insider attack\u0026#39 in AfghanistanFrance’s relationship with the English language?

About 40 per cent of the population are indigenous and 27 per cent are ethnic European. The rest is of mostly Polynesian and Indonesian origin.Kanak flags flew everywhere on the predominantly Kanak island of Ouvéa, where separatists killed four gendarmes and took 27 others hostage in 1988.Macky Wea, one of the hostage-takers, called for a boycott of the “fake” and “illegitimate” referendum, who argued that “only the colonised people, the Kanaks, should have the right to vote.”A flag from the FLNKS, Front de liberation nationale kanak socialiste (Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front) flutters in a former settler\u0026#39s property of PoindimieNevertheless, some Kanaks will vote to stay in France. Simon Loueckhote, a former senator, has been touring Ouvéa, personally putting up posters bearing the slogan, “La France est une chance,” which roughly translates as “France is our good fortune.”Mr Loueckhote, 61, pointed out that the state pumps about £1.15 billion per year into New Caledonia. “The islanders are 100 per cent aided, supported and maintained by the public authorities.

The then Tesco boss had just collected the Management Today Most Admired Company and Most Admired Company Leader awards. He was the king of retail, responsible for propelling Tesco to dominance. I asked Leahy what was the pivotal moment, when Tesco began to defeat the competition? He said it was when employees were ordered to think only Tesco, they could no longer refer to something Sainsbury’s, the market leader, had done and how they could ape it. From now on, it was just Tesco. The policy led to the Tesco Clubcard, Tesco  and other innovations, and, after a while, to Tesco’s hegemony. I was thinking of this in relation to Jack’s, Tesco’s new discount chain. Perhaps I am missing something but I cannot see the logic for it. Jack’s is a distraction, a gimmick, one that will not make any difference to Tesco profits and may even end up eroding them. Jack’s: Everything we know so far about Tesco’s new discount storeTesco’s new discount chain Jack’s will be ‘cheapest in town’ Tesco\u0027s Jack\u0027s has a silly name but it\u0027s a better bet than Asbury\u0027s Jamie Oliver is the new face of TescoLet’s believe, however, that Tesco, which went downhill towards the end of the Leahy reign, endured a slump, and is now being revitalised under Dave Lewis, really does see Jack’s as vital to its future prosperity. If so, they appear to have forgotten the Leahy lesson.Jack’s is clearly an attempt to follow the German discounters, Aldi and Lidl. But what Lewis and his cohorts have created is confusing. It’s called Jack’s, in deference to Tesco founder\u0026nbspSir Jack Cohen. He was a great “pile it high, sell it cheap” operator, so for a Tesco budget label, that makes sense. However, in a clear slug at the Germans and their sourcing, Jack’s boasts that “8 out of 10 products are British”\u0026nbspand as backup, there are Union Jacks everywhere. Presumably, based on research showing that some consumers aren’t thrilled with Germanic produce, Tesco has decided to strike a blow for Britain. But that does not make sense, either, because more than enough shoppers are completely content with Aldi and Lidl’s wares. The effect in a Jack’s is to feel like a declaration of war, with Aldi and Lidl firmly installed as the enemy. From the off, Tesco is fighting on someone else’s terms, not its own. And that goes against the Leahy doctrine. Then there’s the size. Tesco is aiming to have 12 stores by Christmas. That equates to a couple of hundred thousand square feet versus a total UK footprint for Tesco of 35 million square feet. Jack’s is a blip on Tesco, so small as to be immaterial. That’s the number of Jack’s stores Tesco is aiming to open eventually, according to reportsEven if Jack’s reached 90 outlets, thought to be the masterplan, that would be insignificant against Tesco’s 3,000. Why bother? Why ert so much effort and management attention on something that does not matter? Being so tiny brings with it another problem. It’s not worth suppliers having a dedicated production line for a mere 12 stores. So Jack’s own-label goods must be Tesco own-label repackaged as Jack’s. Not only does that open up the prospect of cannibalisation, as shoppers who would otherwise purchase the Tesco item buy the same one more cheaply at Jack’s, but the Jack’s margin is being drastically slashed. \u0026nbspNow comes the appliance-of-science bit. Anyone who supposes Aldi and Lidl just push out stock at low prices is wrong. There is calculation in every single thing they do.A fascinating article by advertising planning guru John Lowery (he’s advised Lidl among many others) sheds much light on how they operate. Lowery toured the first Jack’s, at Chatteris, with ex-Lidl boss, Ronny Gottschlich. First they meet iced doughnuts – hundreds, if not thousands, of them. How many can the people of Chatteris eat? But there are no plain and chocolate doughnuts. They’re out of stock. As are the ready meals, but, says Ronny, “The fridge is on. They’re wasting electricity.” Gottschlich produces his ruler and measures the shelf depth. There’s 94mm at the back that is empty, doing nothing. That translates into redundant metal, and cost. All over the store there is Jack’s own label. “That means they can’t get as close to mimicking the brands that they’re trying to gain sales from.” Out comes the stopwatch. It takes an assistant 11.2 seconds to rip off the lid of the box of cooked ham. In Lidl, the perforations are deeper and the packaging\u0026nbspcomes away more easily, in a maximum of 5.3 seconds. Which means the worker can get on with another task. Same with the bleach bottles. In Jack’s, the labels all face the front. Someone has arranged them like that, but such decorative precision takes time. In Lidl, they’re not, “Because it’s a waste of man-hours. The shoppers know it’s bleach. You could be doing something else… like manning the tills.” There are two sizes of\u0026nbsptrollies. “Why? It increases costs.”Gottschlich discovers that four out of five staff at the Jack’s previously worked in a Tesco. “There you go. They’ve learned to turn the packs round at Tesco. It will take months to knock that kind of behaviour out of them.”In obsessing about Aldi and Lidl, in creating Jack’s, Tesco is ceasing to be Tesco. And forgetting the instruction of its former brilliant chief.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the three months to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Chief executive Ralf Speth warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Mr Ratcliffe has amassed a fortune estimated at £21bn through his petrochemicals company and has previously said the UK would be “perfectly successful” outside the EU.In August he announced he was moving to Monaco, the Mediterranean tax haven where he owns property. His company was criticised\u0026nbspfor shifting its tax residence from the UK to Switzerland in 2010, before moving back six years later. \u0026nbspMr Ratcliffe has said he would invest £600m to begin output of his new off-roader from 2020-21, saying he would prefer to build in Britain despite cheaper alternatives in countries such as Germany where the workforce is already trained and Ineos could use existing sites.“We’d have to build new in the UK so to balance that playing field, because you’re talking about hundreds of millions to build a facility... it does need some government support,” he said when the plans were first announced in 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The theme for the polymer note is a celebration of the UK’s achievements in science, the Bank said. The public now has six weeks to nominate a historical character “who has contributed to science and influenced UK society”.Old £10 notes are not legal tender after todayPaper £10 notes to go out of circulation tomorrowBank of England to keep making notes with animal fat despite protestsThe character will be pictured in addition to the Queen, replacing steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Bolton who currently feature on the note alongside her Majesty. According to the central bank, that person could have worked in any field of science including astronomy, biology, bio-technology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, medical research, physics, technology or zoology.Some of the names suggested so far include Professor Stephen Hawking, who died earlier this year, and Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer.Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: “I am delighted that the new £50 will celebrate the UK’s contribution to science. There is a wealth of iniduals whose work has shaped how we think about the world and who continue to inspire people today. “Our banknotes are an opportunity to celebrate the ersity of UK society and highlight the contributions of its greatest citizens. My colleagues and I look forward to hearing from the public as they think science and put forward their nominations.”Sarah John, chief cashier and director of notes, said: “Developing a new £50 note is an important step to ensure we can continue to provide secure banknotes that can be used with confidence. “For this note, we want people to nominate a variety of characters to reflect the brilliance and breadth of the UK’s contributions to the field of science.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the three months to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Chief executive Ralf Speth warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Mr Ratcliffe has amassed a fortune estimated at £21bn through his petrochemicals company and has previously said the UK would be “perfectly successful” outside the EU.In August he announced he was moving to Monaco, the Mediterranean tax haven where he owns property. His company was criticised\u0026nbspfor shifting its tax residence from the UK to Switzerland in 2010, before moving back six years later. \u0026nbspMr Ratcliffe has said he would invest £600m to begin output of his new off-roader from 2020-21, saying he would prefer to build in Britain despite cheaper alternatives in countries such as Germany where the workforce is already trained and Ineos could use existing sites.“We’d have to build new in the UK so to balance that playing field, because you’re talking about hundreds of millions to build a facility... it does need some government support,” he said when the plans were first announced in 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if even Star Wars can flop,\u0026nbspMarvel could certainly begin to lose steam. Here\u0027s a few cards it can play to stop that happeningClick to followThe Independent‘s Of The Galaxy’ was a huge commercial hit – but can it last?Bad luck superhero haters: there’s another of Marvel’s\u0026nbspcostumed crusaders at\u0026nbspyour\u0026nbsplocal multiplex\u0026nbspin the form of Venom.\u0026nbspThe hype machine is also moving into high gear for Captain Marvel, even though that’s not\u0026nbspscheduled to drop until March. There have been contradictory reports about whether Venom, starring Tom Hardy, is going to be part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe (MFCU) or not.\u0026nbspSony holds the rights to Spider-Man and several linked characters, but struck a complicated deal with Marvel Studios, and ultimate owner Disney, to bring the web slinger into the MCU, which resulted in the wildly successful Spider-Man: Homecoming\u0026nbspat $880m\u0026nbsp(£685m) global gross. A sequel is due next year.\u0026nbspBut, depending on the box office, Venom could become part of a separate Sony Marvel universe. It would likely major on anti-heroes, which might be a lot of fun. Much depends on the film’s gross.Jake Gyllenhaal to play the villain in Spider-Man sequelBefore we look at the future, it’s worth reflecting on just what a remarkable creation MCU is from both a financial, but also a critical, perspective. Marvel Studios has put out 20 interlinked films so far, featuring seven inidual characters and one team (s of the Galaxy), which it has then brought together in three Avengers movies (four if you count Captain America: Civil War) with the fourth (and final?) outing due next year. What’s more, it has done it with mostly “B”\u0026nbspcharacters.\u0026nbspThe comic book publisher’s prior practice had been to licence its top properties to others. This is how Sony got Spider-Man, and Venom, and 21st Century Fox got the X-Men suite of characters, and the Fantastic Four.\u0026nbspDespite this, not since Captain America, back in 2011, has an MCU film failed to gross more than $500m globally. Six have broken the $1bn barrier and Avengers: Infinity War raked in twice that.\u0026nbspCritics sometimes grouse about the popularity of superhero movies, and the stranglehold they hold over multiplex screen space and the global box office, but they’ve been remarkably kind to the MCU’s output when it comes to their reviews.\u0026nbspAll its movies have been certified fresh by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with scores ranging from 66 per cent (Thor: The Dark World) to 97 per cent (Black Panther), an achievement unmatched by any other major franchise.\u0026nbspIf you find Tomatoes’ binary “freshrotten” system too simplistic, how about Metacritic? It puts together a weighted average of critics’ reviews to create a “Metascore”, and also separates films into five bands (two red, one amber, two green).\u0026nbspAll but three of Marvel’s films boast a green, “generally favourable”\u0026nbspor better rating, with Black Panther’s 88 again at the top (indicating “universal acclaim”).\u0026nbspIt just wouldn’t do to have the Best Film Oscar going to a superhero flick, so the Academy has created a gong for “Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film”. It’s already been dubbed the Black Panther award.\u0026nbspThe Dark World again brings up the rear, its score of 54 rating puts its reviews into the “mixed or average”\u0026nbspband.\u0026nbspBut compare that with rival franchises. That 54 low point is still better than any of the three Fox Fantastic Four filmsWarner Bros has produced five movies in the much younger DC extended universe, just one of which (Wonder Woman) has garnered “universal acclaim”\u0026nbspwhile being “certified fresh”. They’ve all grossed more than $500m (I’m charitably excluding the disastrous Green Lantern here, which everyone tries to forget about) but not one has breached the $1bn barrier. “Troubled”\u0026nbspis a word that is frequently applied to the project.\u0026nbspDeadpool’ has been\u0026nbspFox’s best grossing superhero flick so farAlthough Fox’s 11-strong X-Men slate has produced several critical hits, it has still turned in three “certified rotten”\u0026nbspduds alongside them.\u0026nbspIts best gross of $783m, meanwhile, came courtesy of the R-\u0026nbspor 15-rated Deadpool, something no one really expected upon the delightfully anarchic movie’s release.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that I’m not allowing for inflation here, and the first X-Men film was released back in 2000, but even had I done so, the X-movies would struggle to hold a candle to the MCU. \u0026nbspThe critics who have speculated (plaintively sometimes) about superhero fatigue setting in got some ammunition courtesy of the (relatively) disappointing opening for Antman \u0026amp The Wasp.\u0026nbspBut that film has now grossed in excess of $100m more than the franchise’s first outing at $620m and counting, which isn’t too shabby for a second tier franchise with a light (for a superhero flick) production and marketing budget.\u0026nbsp“Never bet against Marvel,” said Forbes, reporting on the numbers. And given all that, why would you?In a word, gravity. It has even started to weigh on even a Star Wars franchise that managed to sell three bad movies to an adoring public and looked all but bomb proof until audiences shrugged their shoulders at Solo: A Star Wars Story, which now, shockingly, looks set for a loss despite enjoying mostly positive reviews.\u0026nbspSo Marvel’s job isn’t going to get an easier.\u0026nbspBut it still has cards it can play...This one is blindingly, glaringly obvious. Launching the MCU with mostly middling characters, in terms of public perception, was a big risk. Marvel then doubled down by producing some highly successful films starring heroes that were largely unknown outside of the comic buying public such as Antman, the s, even Dr Strange.Yet in spite, or perhaps because of, a willingness to roll the dice, even on a superhero who’s main power is shrinking in a movie featuring a fight on a Thomas the Tank Engine toy railway that results in Thomas suddenly growing to giant size and exploding out of a house, Marvel has proved remarkably conservative with respect to its leads.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.33 Superhero films set for release between 2016 and 2020 Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Release date: 6 May 2016. Iron Man and Captain America are set to face off in this superhero blockbuster that will feature nearly all the Avengers but won’t be an Avengers film. It will also mark the first time Spider-Man will feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Sony having made a deal with Marvel Studios. Release date: 27 May 2016. Following the success of Days of Future Past, Apocalypse will follow the young X-Men team as the battle against Oscar Isaac’s titular villain as he gathers his four horsemen Magneto (Fassbender), Angel (Hardy), Storm (Shipp), and Psylocke (Munn). Expect carnage and no Wolverine. Release date: 5 August 2016. The first ‘supervillain’ film, Suicide Squad is also based in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe, where Batman and Superman live) and will introduce the world to Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and Jared Leto’s Joker. One of the more exciting upcoming DC films that’s for sure.Release date: 4 November 2016. Benedict Cumberbatch will debut in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe, where Captain America and Iron Man live) as the Sorcerer Supreme. The film already has an incredible cast, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachael McAdams and Tilda Swinton. Release date: 20 February 2017. Kicking off 2017 is the Lego version of Batman, who will lead his own spin-off, having already featured in the amazing Lego Movie. Will Arnett voices the titular character, while Zach Garfianakis - from the Hangover - will voice The Joker. But will he better than Leto?Release date: 3 March 2017. Having not starred in X-Men: Apocalypse, Wolverine will return to the big screen in a solo film which was recently made R-Rated following the success of Deadpool.

Cast includes newcomers Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff, as well as, rumour has it, Sylvester Stallone.Release date: 23 June 2017. Gal Gadot is returning to the DCEU in her very own film, marking the first female-led superhero film on this list. Chris Pine is on board to play Wonder Woman’s love interest.Release date: 7 July 2017. Yes, it is another Spider-Man reboot, having previously been redone with Andrew Garfield as the lead. However, this time it is part of the MCU, with Tom Holland as the titular character, and a heavily rumoured cameo by Iron Man could be in the pipeline. We can dream.Release date: 6 October 2017. In a strange announcement, Fox decided to withhold the release of Gambit until a future, as-yet unannounced date, which could be here, or this could be a completely separate project. Many suspect Deadpool 2 could nicely fit here, Fox capitalising on the success of the first film.Release date: 3 November 2017. Chris Hemsworth will be returning as the Norse God in his third solo MCU film. Flight of the Conchords’ Taika Waititi is on board to direct, and promises a fun adventure that will likely lead into Marvel’s next project, Infinity War.Release date: 17 November 2017. Hot on the heals of Thor comes Justice League Part One, the first DCEU team-up flick which will see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg work together to fight bad guys.Release date: 12 January 2018.

There’s also talk of an X-Force film, with Deadpool and other mutants teaming up to fight evil.Release date: 16 February 2018. The first non-white male-led superhero film in the MCU comes in the form of Black Panther, with Chadwick Boseman reprising the titular role, having also starred as the Panther in Civil War. Creed’s Ryan Coogler is on to direct what could be a very exciting film.Release date: 16 March 2018. The Flash will be the first DCEU film since Justice League, and sees Ezra Miller take the lead. Phil Lord and Chris Miller were supposed to pen the film before Disney snapped them up for the Han Solo-film, leaving Seth Grahame-Smith to take charge.Release date: 4 May 2018. And so, we finally get to the point of all these Infinity Stones! Thanos will be the big bad, with the Avengers needing to team up to defeat their biggest foe yet. It has previously been described as “the end of the Avengers as we know it”.1734 17. Ant-Man and The WaspRelease date: 6 July 2018. Peyton Reed will be back to direct this surprise sequel to one of the better received MCU films. While the name is ridiculous, at least Marvel are finally having a leading female superhero. Release date: 13 July 2018. Again, not much word on this one except it is thought to be X-Men spin-off New Mutants, something Josh Boone has been hit up to write.Release date: 20 July 2018. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Amy Pascal - the team behind the live-action Spider-Man films - are producing this ‘unrelated’ animated adaptation of the hero. Because you can never have too much Spider-Man, right?Release date: 27 July 2018. Another Justice League spin-off, Jason Momoa plays the leading man. Furious 7’s James Wan is on to direct, but little else is known about the film.Release date: 8 March 2019. We’ve hit 2019, and the first confirmed superhero film will be the first proper female-led MCU film. No-one is confirmed to be in the titular role of Carol Danvers just yet.Release date: 5 April 2019. Dwayne Johnson stars as the villain in this DCEU film which will be somewhat separate to the other DC films.Release date: 3 May 2019. The conclusion to the long drawn MCU saga. Expect a big finish with at least a few planets being destroyed.Release date: 14 June 2019. Soon after the Infinity War story reaches its conclusion, so will the Justice League’s. Not much is known, except Darkseid will likely be the villain for at least one of the parts.Release date: 12 July 2019. The concept of Inhumans (or Marvel’s mutants) has already been introduced in TV, through Marvel’s Agents of Shield, yet the film is expected to introduce the Royal Family who have yet to be seen in the show.Release date: 3 April 2020. Having debuted in Justice League Part One three years previously, Cyborg will finally be making his own outing, with Ray Fisher as the titular character.Release date: 1 May 2020. The first of three untitled Marvel films. There are a couple of contenders, the first is a likely sequel to Spider-Man with Sony, or a third s of the Galaxy film, thus finishing the trilogy.Release date: 19 June 2020. Before you start to worry, this has nothing to do with the Ryan Reynolds-starring flick that hit cinemas a little while ago. Instead, this will be another DCEU film that will likely spin-off from Justice League after the Green Lantern Corps cameo in one of the parts.Release date: 10 July 2020. As well as Spider-Man or s of the Galaxy sequels, a Doctor Strange or Black Panther one could fit in nicely here. Or perhaps Black Widow may finally get the solo-film she deserves.Release date: 6 November 2020. Some speculators also think a Blade film could fit in here, marking over 20 years since the first Blade. But many believe the character may be better suited to a Netflix series, as with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. There’s also talk of a Runaways film reaching cinemas at some stage.Release date: TBA. Now we’re onto the TBA release dates, the first of which is a Batman solo film, written and directed by Ben Affleck. When this is due, no one is quite sure but expect it sooner rather than later if Batman v Superman is a success. Release date: TBA (rumoured 2017). A sequel to Suicide Squad is expected to come in 2017 according to recent reports, but nothing has been confirmed. If the first is successful, it should come as no surprise for Warner Bros to rearrange their schedule to fit in this surefire hit.Release date: TBA. This is an odd one, as it has been confirmed Sony are wanting to release a Venom film completely unrelated to the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. Venom, as you may know, is a Spider-Man villain, intrinsically linked to Spider-Man, so it seems odd they would release a film unrelated to the rebooted project and not linked to the MCU.Well, now you mention it, there’s also that sequel to Fantastic Four that has seemingly been dropped by Fox. Plus, there’s the Gambit film which has been put on hold (but will likely fill an untitled Fox slot so we haven’t added it extra). Then again, it could be shoehorned in somehow…Release date: 6 May 2016.

Plus, there’s the Gambit film which has been put on hold (but will likely fill an untitled Fox slot so we haven’t added it extra). Then again, it could be shoehorned in somehow…None of the 20 films to date have been fronted by a woman (the Wasp got second billing to Antman in Antman \u0026amp The Wasp).\u0026nbspOnly Black Panther has been headed by a non-white character, despite the success of the non-MCU films featuring Marvel character Blade portrayed by Wesley Snipes.\u0026nbspEven the “team” films have been anchored by, and mostly focused upon, white guys.\u0026nbspThe same is basically true of the baddies.\u0026nbspBlack Panther’s stunning success –\u0026nbspit achieved the highest gross for a “solo”\u0026nbspcharacter film and the fourth highest for an MCU film overall, ought to change that.\u0026nbspDC’s Wonder Woman, meanwhile, nailed the myth that movie goers wouldn’t support a female-led film with its $822m gross, the highest for the young DC extended universe. It would have been in the top 10 were it a Marvel outing.\u0026nbspLupita Nyong’o as Nakia\u0026nbspand Letitia Wright as Shuri\u0026nbspin ‘Black Panther’ (Marvel StudiosDisney)There are welcome signs that this is changing. Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is slated to play a big role in the MCU’s future. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow also looks like she’s finally going to get a solo outing, although her fans might have to wait a while. The next s outing is rumoured to focus not on\u0026nbspChris Pratt’s Peter Quill, but\u0026nbspmore on the character of Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, who is of Domican and Puerto Rican descent but is bright green in the films.\u0026nbspApart from the fact that this is the right thing to do, a more erse roster ought to be good for the finances.\u0026nbspLet’s face it, if you’re going to shell out more than $200m in production costs, plus the same again (at least) for the marketing, you need a global audience. The domestic gross just won’t cut it.\u0026nbspTories, Ukipers and Trumpkins can cry about all they want, but the world is a pretty erse place. DC’s Suicide Squad provides another example of how lucrative ersity can be. It had Will Smith at the head of multi-racial cast, with Viola Davis as one of the main antagonists.\u0026nbspDespite the disdain of the critics, the film pulled in a more than healthy $750m, and might have done better had it secured a release in China and not been hampered by a 15 rating in countries like Britain and Australia. Deadline Hollywood nonetheless ranked it as the tenth most profitable movie of 2016. ‘Nuff said.\u0026nbspIt’s not that they’ve been, well, bad. But the MCU’s villains mostly haven’t been particularly memorable, at least not until recently.\u0026nbspIt might be asking a lot to find something that rivals the late Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn as The Joker in Batman: The Dark Knight. That sets a very high bar.\u0026nbspBut there’s room for improvement. Beyond Tom Hiddleston’s multiple outings as Loki, I struggle to recall all that much about the others, having seen every MCU film on multiple occasions. They do rather merge into one another.\u0026nbspBut there are signs that that too is changing for the better.\u0026nbspJosh Brolin’s Thanos provides a black hole for the dizzying array of characters featured in Avengers: Infinity War to orbit, and helps bring together what might otherwise have served as a rather aimless series of spectacles.\u0026nbspA study in understated menace, what makes him stand out is his utter conviction that his genocidal vision is right and moral, by contrast to the nihilist portrayed in the comics.Tennant gets his evil on as Kilgrave in ’Jessica Jones’ (Netflix)Then there is the charismatic revolutionary Killmonger (Michael B Jordan). There are many, myself included, who found themselves rooting for him as much as for the Black Panther he faced off against.\u0026nbspOnly his methods, and carelessness towards the civilians getting in his way, make him a villain.This is a good sign, but Marvel’s going to need more multi-faceted and layered baddies if it’s going to counter the feeling of, oh, I see, another superhero flick. I dunno, fancy a game of Fortnite?\u0026nbspPS: If Marvel has any sense it will find a way to resurrect David Tennant’s Kilgrave, who made the first season of Netflix’s Jessica Jones so compelling. His cameos also livened up the disappointing second outing. Now there’s a truly memorable villain. Which brings us neatly to...I’m probably on a hiding to nothing with this one – Marvel Studio’s president Kevin Feige, who deserves much of the credit for the monster that’s been created, has been notably lukewarm about the prospect of bringing it\u0026nbspto the silver screen. Marvel has multiple properties, hosted by multiple broadcasters.\u0026nbspABC’s Agents of Shield started out shadowing the films. The show’s lead character Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) appeared in the first Avengers movie, Thor and two of Iron Man’s three outings. He will show up in the 1990s set Captain Marvel too. Samuel L Jackson, who plays Nick Fury in the movies, also turned up in the show a couple of times.\u0026nbspBut it went on to erge and one of its stars, Chloe Bennet, notably expressed her frustration at the films’ failure to acknowledge the show.\u0026nbspYou could be forgiven for thinking that the mostly successful Netflix series featuring “street”\u0026nbspheroes trying to save their neighbourhoods rather than the galaxy, are set in an entirely different universe.\u0026nbspThey’re grimy, 15 rated, and violent. That violence feels much more real than what is depicted in the films. When people get hit they get hurt. They end up in hospitals. Rosario Dawson’s Night Nurse sometimes has to patch them up.\u0026nbspDeadpool showed how successful taking a 180 degree turn can be. It was produced for just $58m, about a quarter of what it costs to get a top line superhero flick done, and there were no 3D\u0026nbspcameras around on set either.\u0026nbspThe global\u0026nbspgross of the wildly successful ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’The Defenders, in which four of the Netflix stars teamed up for a mini series that, sadly, added up to less than the sum of its parts, occasionally gets mentioned as a possibility for a film, albeit a distant one.\u0026nbspPerhaps that will change if superhero fatigue starts to set in and the studio has to think about something genuinely different to tickle audiences’ palates. Disney’s own streaming ambitions add a further ingredient to the TVfilm crossover stew. \u0026nbspThis is a card the studio really shouldn’t play. When story takes a back seat to spectacle, the film suffers. Warner’s first DC Universe outing, Man of Steel, was ruined by director Zack Snyder indulging in a spectacle laden battle between Superman and General Zod, which smashed up the city of polis. It was jarring –\u0026nbspthe comic book character would have done his damnedest to protect the city –\u0026nbspbut worse still, it was kind of boring.\u0026nbspThe first trailer for Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is hereRuby Rose to star as lesbian superhero Batwoman in new seriesSupergirl to get television’s first ever transgender superheroThe same is true of X-Men: Age of Apocalypse. The hotly anticipated return of Brian Singer, who got the franchise rolling with the critically acclaimed first outing, also majored on spectacle, and the resultant film ending up a disappointing mess after an encouraging start. Story rules. Write that out 10,000 times. Then write it out again. \u0026nbspIf superhero fatigue really does start to set in, there’s always the X-Men – which will be under Disney’s control if and when the entertainment behemoth’s deal to buy a big chunk of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire makes it past America’s anti-trust watchdogs.\u0026nbspIf you bring the mutants into the MCU, and then have them fight a new team of Avengers, like they did in the widely successful Avengers v\u0026nbspX-Men comic book event, you’ll likely have another $2bn beast on your hands, or even multiple such creatures.\u0026nbspGeekdom is positively drooling at the mere thought of such an event. Those of us with a few miles on the clock might keel over if it ultimately gets announced.\u0026nbspHopefully there’ll be a hero or two around to save us.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The fact that Jemisin is a black woman made her winning streak all the more historic.It’s probably something that shouldn’t even need to be mentioned after all, the contemporary science fiction scene is more erse than it has ever been in its history, and women writers and people of colour are the norm, not the exception.This week the reader review site Goodreads launched its annual Goodreads Choice Awards.

Only four are written by white men.Who was the black science fiction pioneer Octavia E Butler?Women in science fiction: whither the brides of Frankenstein?So why is it worth talking about at all? Because the origins of the contemporary science fiction field were anything but erse, as outlined in a new book, Astounding, by Alec Nevala-Lee.Astounding takes a certain focus in the look at the history of science fiction literature, looking at the start of what is commonly called the Golden Age, which is generally accepted to have run from about 1939 to 1950.Even if you’re not particularly au fait with the world of science fiction writing, some of the names from that era will certainly be recognisable Isaac Asimov, who wrote a multitude of novels and short stories including the sequence which was loosely adapted into the movie I, Robot, starring Will Smith. Robert A Heinlein, author of\u0026nbspStranger in a Strange Land, Have Spacesuit – Will Travel, and Starship Troopers (among a plethora more), the latter of which also got the big screen treatment in 1997. L Ron Hubbard, who later became much more notorious as the founder of the Church of Scientology but, back in the 1930s, was one of the triumvirate of young writers, along with Asimov and Heinlein, who form the narrative backbone of Nevala-Lee’s history.Jemisin’s multiple Hugo Award wins? (Laura Hanifin)But the book is also – and primarily – the story of John W Campbell, who won’t have the same recognition factor, but who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of science fiction.Campbell was born in 1910 in Newark, New Jersey, and had a prolific writing career until he was appointed editor of Astounding magazine in 1938. He brought on and encouraged Asimov, Heinlein and Hubbard – three very different and often conflicting characters – and ushered in the Golden Age.When we think of the Golden Age we think of the classic science fiction tropes. Optimistic futurism at a time when the real world was chugging towards global warfare. Sleek rockets and square-jawed heroes, damsels in distress menaced by slimy, tentacled aliens.It’s an image of science fiction that is largely absent in the form today, but back in the late 1930s, perhaps because the world was rapidly becoming a rather dreadful place, this unique brand of escapism began to gain traction.\u0026nbspIf you wanted your science fiction in the Golden Age, it came in the written form. Magazines such as ‘Astounding’ proliferated and serialised novels or published short fictionIt was still, from the mainstream point of view, a relatively niche genre. Today, science fiction is ubiquitous. TV and streaming services such as Netflix are full of it – Stranger Things, The Handmaid’s Tale, Black Mirror. Doctor Who is enjoying one of its most notable periods ever. At the multiplexes, people who would never consider themselves science fiction fans routinely push films such as the Star Wars franchise, Ready Player One, the Marvel movies, to the top of the box office lists.\u0026nbspBut back in the Golden Age, sci-fi was largely absent at the movie theatres, save for the chapter serials featuring Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, and it wasn’t until the 1950s that the schlocky drive-in alien invasion craze started, fuelled by post-war fears about communism and the enemy within. TV didn’t really catch up until the 1960s, with Star Trek, The Outer Limits, Land of the Giants.So if you wanted your science fiction in the Golden Age, it came in the written form. Magazines such as Astounding proliferated and serialised novels or published short fiction. This is where the genre was really born, and something else was minted as well the image, which stood for a very long time, of science fiction as something almost exclusively white and male.Nevala-Lee notes that the science fiction that Campbell decided to shape was all about “the competent man” – the hero who would save the world, the galaxy, the universe. Nevala-Lee writes that Campbell’s term “points to the way in which science fiction encourages certain assumptions. Editors like Campbell tended to favour writers who looked like them, and from the start, fandom was overwhelmingly male. Women were often regarded with suspicion, and even when they were welcomed, they could still be treated poorly.”Though Campbell occupies a special place in science fiction history, he held some pretty abhorrent views. His omission of black characters, for example, wasn’t just something to put down to him being “a man of his time”, or ignorance it was a wilful decision.Nevala-Lee quotes Campbell as saying, “Think about it a bit, and you’ll realise why there is so little mention of blacks in science fiction we see no reason to go saying ‘Lookee lookee lookee! We’re using blacks in our stories! See the Black Man! See him in a space ship”. Nevala-Lee observes: “The implication was that protagonists should be white males by default – a stance that he might not even have seen as problematic.”Campbell was also stoutly anti-feminist, saying that women who demanded equal rights also refused to give up what he considered their “girlish special privileges”. He once declared, “No woman has ever attained first-rank competence in literature in any Indo-European language.”It’s not that there weren’t science fiction writers who were people of colour or women\u0026nbsp(or both) back in the Golden Age… it’s just that they didn’t get a look in. Samuel R Delany, now 76, is considered one of the most important writers in the genre ever. He’s also African-American, and gay (Campbell had a lot to say about homosexuality, as well, and none of it good). While once grudgingly admitting of Delany “this guy can write and has a lot of brilliant ideas” he constantly rejected Delany’s submissions, and turned down the novel Nova – which would go on to be a rightly-regarded classic. Delany recalled that Campbell “didn’t feel his readership would be able to relate to a black main character”.Campbell did publish several women writers, though later on in his career, including Anne McCaffrey, Kate Wilhelm and Alice Sheldon, whose first story “The Birth of a Salesman” appeared in one of Campbell’s alter magazines, Analog, in 1967. Sheldon wrote under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr, saying: “A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that a man would slip by less observed. I’ve had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation.” It wasn’t until 1977 that it became widely known that Tiptree was actually a woman.All of this contributed to the idea of science fiction being a boy’s club, and a white boy’s club at that. But what Nevala-Lee’s book does is put the spotlight back on women who have been airbrushed out of most official histories of the Golden Age, particularly Campbell’s first wife Dona, Heinlein’s first wife Leslyn, and perhaps the true hero of the story, Campbell’s assistant Kay Tarrant.All of them were instrumental in keeping Astounding afloat in the early days indeed when the war arrived and all four of the principal male characters in this story had to interrupt their careers to join up, Robert A Heinlein wanted to get Dona and Kay appointed editors of the magazine in his absence.Guin, who died earlier this year, presided over American science fiction for nearly half a century (Getty)Campbell generally referred to Kay Tarrant as his secretary, but in truth she did the lion’s share of the work, going through fiction submissions for Campbell to approve, overseeing proofreading, copy-editing, administration and production of Astounding and Campbell’s other magazines, a job she did for 30 years.The science fiction world that Campbell and his stable of writers created endured for years, but he began to lose touch with the genre especially as the 1960s dawned. The world was changing and Campbell’s white, male enclave was becoming increasingly irrelevant. A new sort of science fiction was emerging, which was dubbed New Wave. Just as, a decade later, punk would sweep away the pomp of prog rock, New Wave tackled all the things that Campbell thought were anathema in science fiction – sex, gender, drugs, post-modernism, politics – and mocked the stout, square-jawed heroes of the pulp years.Women writers, so long kept in the shadows of science fiction, began to emerge and thrive. Writers such as Joanna Russ and her novels, including The Female Man, gained prominence, and in this period Ursula K Le Guin began to achieve what would be a climb towards a place at the very top of the literary world.\u0026nbspNew Wave burned brightly, but for a relatively short period, into the 1970s. It did not perhaps herald the dawn of a new, equitable, erse age as many hoped, at least not straight away. But it did demonstrate that a democratisation of science fiction was underway, and the grip of Campbell was loosed and eventually lost.Nevala-Lee says:\u0026nbsp“Science fiction is too large now to be directed or defined by any one person, but this book concentrates on a period in which one man was thought to oversee it – until many of his readers broke free. Campbell liked to say that the genre’s true protagonist was all of mankind, but he saw it in terms of heroic figures, starting with himself.“If his audience ultimately refused to fall in line it led, paradoxically, to the outcome that he wanted. Science fiction became an ongoing collaboration between writers and fans, and the most convincing proof of Campbell’s success is that he lost control of it.Ursula K Le Guin: Giant of Science fictionDespite his viewpoints on so many things, Campbell is still revered today as one of the founding fathers of contemporary science fiction, as are his collaborators Asimov, Heinlein and Hubbard. To say they were all, in their own ways, problematic is an understatement. Asimov is considered one of the all-time greats, but Nevala-Lee outlines in detail his proclivity for pinching women’s behinds at science fiction conventions, something he seemed to see as a bit of fun but which, quite rightly today, would have him marked out as a serial assaulter.What would Campbell have made of NK Jemisin’s multiple Hugo Award wins? We can only guess, along with his thoughts on the success of authors such as Nnedi Okorafor, or Kameron Hurley, or Ann Leckie, or any of the women who are currently dominating science fiction with female-led stories that upend expectations and blast the traditional old tropes so beloved of the Golden Age into the sun. We can only guess, but it’s fair to say that his thoughts would not have been very pretty.And that’s not to say that the battle is won. In recent years there have been attempts to lead a backlash against the increasing ersity in science fiction, especially in America where concerted campaigns to keep the likes of Jemisin off the awards ballots have been prevalent, orchestrated by white men who miss the days of robust, heterosexual heroes rescuing grateful, lissom women from the clutches of salacious alien marauders. Indeed, one of these campaigns overtly called for “a Campbellian revolution” in science fiction.John W Campbell is one of those figures around who the argument will endlessly rage about whether it is possible to celebrate the art from the artist, whether his views perpetually colour his achievements, or if we can or cannot deny the effect and influence he had on the science fiction genre, and whether it would be the same without him.And, in the end, it doesn’t matter. Campbell was what he was, and he did what he did. He didn’t create science fiction, nor did he own it. It was an important period in history, but one that has passed. Science fiction today is new and wondrous and inclusive, and perhaps, in years to come, historians will be referring to this, not the Campbell era, as the true Golden Age.‘Astounding’, by Alec Nevala-Lee, is out now, published by Dey St BooksShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

weeksClick to followThe IndependentAn overlooked contributor to the discovery of the DNA double helix and the world’s most famous cosmologist are among those in the running to be the new face of the £50 note.The Bank of England has invited the public to submit the names of\u0026nbspscientific figures they’d like to appear on the new banknote, with a decision set to be announced in six weeks.A shortlist will be drawn up by an expert committee including space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and physicist Simon Singh, with the final decision to be made by the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney.But who are the favourites to\u0026nbspadorn\u0026nbspthe new £50 notes, and what have been their contributions to science and UK society?Many people’s favourite to win will undoubtedly be the recently deceased Hawking, a true scientific superstar whose contributions to science extended far beyond his own discipline.Particle physicist and TV presenter Professor Brian Cox expressed his support for Hawking on the new note,\u0026nbsptweeting: “He made invaluable contributions over half a century to our understanding of cosmology, the early universe and black holes.”Professor Cox added that the former Cambridge academic has inspired thousands of scientists and millions of people through his books and lectures, “me included”.Hawking gave his name to the radiation emitted by black holes, advanced studies of the universe’s origins\u0026nbspand penned the bestselling popular science book A Brief History of Time to transmit ideas from his discipline to more than 10 million readers.Franklin’s work as an X-ray crystallographer at King’s College London produced images that contributed to James Watson and Francis Crick’s identification of the DNA double helix.In the years following her death in 1958, her crucial work has been recognised by many including Watson and Crick themselves, but Franklin was not included in the Nobel Prize the duo went on to win four years later.Franklin’s story is now seen as a cautionary tale about the ways the contributions of women have been ignored over the course of scientific history.A place on the £50 note would be seen by many as a fantastic way to honour a scientist who was never given the recognition she deserved in her lifetime.Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, mentioned Franklin along with palaeontologist Mary Anning as potential faces for the new notes.“They were both underrecognised in their lifetime and now we could set the record straight and recognise the huge achievements they made,” she said.Another figure seen as an overlooked\u0026nbspscientific pioneer from a time when women were not traditionally included in science, Lovelace is often described as the world’s first computer programmer.The daughter of poet Lord Byron, Lovelace was a mathematician who worked on Charles Babbage’s proposed computer, the Analytical Engine.Lovelace translated an article by an Italian military engineer concerning the engine, adding an elaborate set of notes that contain what some have described as the first ever computer program – an algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.Like Franklin, Lovelace has only recently been recognised for her contribution, and her addition to the new £50 would therefore be a fitting tribute for someone who was not recognised in their lifetime.In his role as a codebreaker during the Second World War, Turing played a major part in helping defeat Nazi Germany by providing the allied forces\u0026nbspwith information that gave them the upper hand in key operations.His work at Bletchley Park during the war cracked the German messages sent by the Enigma machine, and is regarded as making key contributions to the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.Turing was convicted in 1952 under anti-homosexuality laws, leading to him accepting chemical castration and ultimately taking his own life two years later.Though he was posthumously pardoned in 2013, many will surely see a place on the currency as a way to honour his legacy.As the only British woman to become a Nobel science laureate, Hodgkin would be another perfect addition to the UK’s currency, and one who many people are perhaps not familiar with.The chemist won the prize in 1964 for her pioneering work that helped unravel the 3D structure of important substances such as insulin.Her nomination was backed by Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan, who said: “I would personally pick Dorothy Hodgkin, the only female Briton to have won a science Nobel Prize.”“We can thank Dorothy for revealing the three-dimensional structures of many biologically important molecules such as penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, as well as inspiring several generations of leading crystallographers.“She was also a remarkable inidual who championed science in developing countries.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

I got kicked out (of school), not for anything crazy, he said. It\u0027s going to sound way crazier than it was, I put loads of chairs on another student.Stormzy on his piano lesson with Paul McCartney: \u0027It was incredible\u0027It sounds mad but we were messing around, it was horseplay and I just put loads of chairs on the student so he was trapped. Enough to entrap the whole human body. It was a spontaneous attack actually.It was just some banter, as you do. It sounds crazy but it was just jokes.Stormzy\u0026nbspadmitted that he had got in trouble prior to the chair incident, resulting in his removal from the school.It was like the 100th strike, you don\u0027t get kicked out for putting chairs on someone, he added.The rapper referred to his younger self as just a little s*** and said his mother was left fuming.Created with Sketch.

When I went in for my last day of recording, I wanted to have my back to them, because usually, you’re facing him so he can look right up and you can talk about it. But I didn’t want to see them and pretend they couldn’t see me.“When I realised what they were going for, I realised, ‘Oh, this is a moment in history’.”Buzz Lightyear actor Allen previously revealed the final scene is so emotional he could barely get through it. He described the way the film’s writers, Will McCormack and Stephany Folsom, decided to end the sequel as “so big” it startled him.Created with Sketch.

Let\u0027s focus on that first and foremost.Earlier in the week, former unionist leader David\u0026nbspTrimble\u0026nbspaccused Mr Varadkar\u0027s government of riding roughshod over the Good Friday Agreement.More Britons expected to travel abroad next year, despite BrexitVoters in every Labour area now support Final Say referendum on BrexitGovernment urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitEU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderLord Trimble, who was closely involved in the talks that led to the peace treaty, voiced fears that Brexit could lead to Northern Ireland being held in an\u0026nbspeffective EU protectorate.The UK and EU have so far been\u0026nbspunable to agree on the customs backstop that will govern\u0026nbsphow the Northern\u0026nbspIrish border should be managed in the event that there is\u0026nbspno trade deal to maintain an open border.The UK is pushing for a backstop that would see the whole UK remain in the customs union temporarily, but the EU also wants the option of only Northern Ireland staying\u0026nbspin the bloc.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There may yet be a Brexit agreement on the Irish border. The latest whispers out of meetings in Brussels are that the EU is preparing to offer a compromise solution on the so-called “backstop”. Whether it will be enough for the UK remains to be seen.But let’s suppose it is, and a withdrawal agreement is signed. Does that prevent a no deal? Not exactly.There are two things that could still cause a no-deal Brexit. Both bring a huge degree of uncertainty.EU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderThe first is the parliamentary vote. Theresa May, you may remember, has no majority in the House of Commons and needs help. How the DUP, Labour, and Conservative Eurosceptics\u0026nbspvote will determine whether a deal passes parliament, even if it has been agreed between\u0026nbspnegotiators.The second uncertainty is over the future trading relationship. An outline of this was supposed to have been agreed by now, but the timetable has slipped because of a lack of progress on Northern Ireland, which the EU insists must be dealt with first.\u0026nbspIt is not widely understood that UK law states that this outline of the future relationship has to be presented to MPs before any vote on the withdrawal deal. But it is simply not clear how this will be possible.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Chequers plan has been dismissed, and she has rejected the EU’s options of a loose free trade agreement or Norway-style single market participation. Negotiations are practically at square one for this, with practically no time left.It is widely claimed that any document will have to be a fudge. But the EU said at the Salzburg summit that any outline must be specific – not just a list of vague aspirations.Brexit talks ‘close to a deal’ says DUP leader Arlene FosterGovernment urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitArron Banks is hoping to become some kind of Brexit martyrUK construction dogged by Brexit uncertainty in OctoberHow agreement could be reached on anything substantial is unclear, and neither side looks able to back the other’s proposals. It’s possible the issue of the trading relationship could make a comeback and sink the whole thing.And yet, if we cannot sign a deal, Britain may still avoid heading over the cliff edge.\u0026nbspThe government says emphatically it is prepared to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, but the truth is the country is simply not prepared. The physical infrastructure needed is not in place and will take years to build, at ports, airports, and elsewhere.\u0026nbspThere is certainly not a majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal, and the political damage to the government of going ahead with one far outweighs any benefit.However, there remains the option to revoke Article 50 – even temporarily – before March 29.\u0026nbspEmpty supermarket shelves, grounded flights, and queues at ports are a prime minister’s worst nightmare. Desperation to avoid this at all costs means that a\u0026nbsplast-minute government U-turn is more than just a possibility\u0026nbsp– it’s likely.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

burglars","story":"Sophie Hannah wrote A Dark Time to pass on security hints and tips to homeowners who find themselves at increased risk of burglary during the winter months.Seven homes in the UK are burgled every minute across a calendar year.A study of , homeowners carried out by a home security firm to coincide with the launch of the book found  per cent of Brits have no security measures in place whatsoever.A Dark Time is the latest entry in Hannah’s Waterhouse and Zailer series, which started in  with the release of Little Face, which sold over , copies in the UK.Sophie Hannah said: “I’ve really loved writing A Dark Time.I had an idea that Id really wanted to try out for ages – and raising awareness around the increased risks to home security now that the nights are getting darker was the perfect fit for executing it.My story idea needed exactly that setting, a dark night, and involved a burglary of a very peculiar kind – a puzzle that I knew my detectives Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer would enjoy solving.UK homes are at an elevated risk of burglary thanks to the clocks going back, according to research.December was revealed as the peak time for break-ins across the UK, with  per cent of Brits experiencing a burglary in the last year alone.And six in  Brits feel more vulnerable to a break-in when the nights grow longer.However, keeping our homes warm and making sure energy bills are paid are the nation’s top concerns after the clocks go back – ahead of securing our castles.Nearly a quarter of Brits have fitted a security alarm to warn off potential intruders, and  per cent keep their house lights on to make it look like someone is home.A further  per cent close their blinds or curtains while they’re out, and just under a tenth have bought a dog to deter burglars from targeting their property.Lee Jasper, security expert at ADT said: “Year on year, we have seen a  per cent increase in burglaries during the darker months.So it’s vital that people put the right security measures in place to help protect their homes to avoid falling victim.“The research shows we’re feeling more vulnerable as a nation when the clocks go back, however there is a clear lack of awareness when it comes down to preventing burglaries.“We’re hoping that the launch of A Dark Time can help the nation safeguard their homes, in an entertaining and engaging way.”A Dark Time is available as a free download from the ADT website from Monday nd October on: https:www.adt

however other students told their parents he may be much older than he says he is.It had been suggested that the inidual is an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK without any paperwork, making it dficult to identy his age.Students and parents claim he lied to British authorities about his age to get an education, as his previous qualications were not recognised in the UK.The Home Office has taken on the investigation into the age of the pupil and how he became enrolled at the school.When asked for a comment a spokesman for the Home Office said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”Sources at the Home Office confirmed that the investigation was being treated “seriously” and appealed for the pupil to be given privacy.In a statement, Stoke High School said: “This is a matter for the Home Office and we have referred it to them.School bosses dropped a suggestion from a previous statement which suggested that the pupil was an asylum seeker.It continued: The student is not attending the school at this time.“We can not comment further on an inidual case, but we have followed Government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any admissions matter. ”Parents have blasted the school over the investigation, accusing school bosses of trying to sweep it under the carpet.One mum fumed in a Facebook post: So My son’s school now let’s in ‘ year old men’ claiming to be a  year old.He’s been there since the start of last term, that’s some huge security breach.Not funny at all but ffs look at his picture of him in class c’mon now I’m  he looks older than me!She said she was later told the pupil had been taken out of school pending investigation.The mum added: If my son didnt like the school Id be taking him out permanently!Another worried parent, who did not want to be named, told the East Anglican Daily Times: “This is extremely concerning.He has told students he has had to lie to get into high school to complete his GCSEs.”A pupil took an image of the inidual dressed in unorm during a year  maths class.The text across the image reads: How is there a  year old man in our maths class.Another parent raged: “My son goes to the school and it is not a nice thought that this man is around children and sitting with them at lunch.”If there is a doubt about someones age as part of an immigration case, the Home Office can arrange for social workers to undertake an assessment.Because there are dferent rules for the treatment of adult and child asylum seekers, the authority has to establish at the outset the age category an inidual is in.Age indicators can include assessments of physical appearance such as height, build, facial hair and voice pitch.The Sun Online has approached the Home Office and Stoke High School for further

The problems are unbelievable.Mr Harris bought the house before it was built, after seeing a show home on the site.He said: It looked like a nice spot, with views of Pembroke Castle. We put a deposit down in February and planned to rent it out.But ever since we got the keys, the reality has been far from perfect.Its caused my we and I no end of worry and stress.

Far from being born into royalty he grew up as an orphan in Colombia.He had managed to make his way into the highest echelons of the global elite after befriending a well-connected asset manager from Orsett in Essex.Carl Marden Williamson, who had moved to the US in his s, was an ideal accomplice — being, according to a former colleague, “a master global networker”.It was urbane, charming Williamson who helped Gignac buy fake diplomatic licence plates from eBay — and who assured Florida’s elite that he had known the prince and his family for  years.Gignac’s aim in Florida was to rake in cash for what he promised would be hugely lucrative shares in Saudi oil giant Aramco, which was worth more than £.trillion.And he looked the part. He was accompanied everywhere by ‘bodyguards’ — handsome men wearing fake diplomatic badges and toting fake guns.A friend said: “Every single building you’d drive by he’d say, ‘Oh, my father owns that’.“He’d just spend, spend, spend, dumping out cash from Louis Vuitton duffle bags and tipping hundred-dollar bills to everyone: building managers, employees, handymen.”The fake prince’s Instagram account features photos of his private jet and yacht, wads of cash, Rolex watches and a dazzling diamond ring.Even tiny Foxy travelled around in a £, Louis Vuitton dog carrier.Gignac’s obsession with wealth is no doubt linked to his troubled childhood.He was one of the orphaned “throwaway” children on the mean streets of Colombia’s capital Bogota, and claims he had to look after his little brother by any means necessary.In a court statement he once revealed: “I was raped when I was five years old and sold on the streets to have sex with men to feed my brother. You don’t know the pain I’ve gone through.”But he was plucked from the crime-ridden city in , when a middle-class American couple adopted Anthony and his brother and moved them to Michigan.An exceptionally bright pupil, Gignac would lie to school friends that his parents were vastly wealthy.Aged , he ran away from home and assumed the identity of Saudi billionaire Prince Adnan Khashoggi.Soon he switched to a new target, Prince Khalid bin al-Saud, real-le son of the current Saudi king, and threw himself into the le of a career criminal.Over the years, he was often hauled before the courts, serving a number of jail terms for ious frauds worth tens of thousands of pounds.After being released, somehow he always managed to find new victims and keep up the charade.But when Gignac met suave Carl Marden Williamson in , a whole new world of possibilities opened up.The Brit was fabulously well connected, with “a Rolodex that was probably thousands of people”, according to we Denise.A former colleague told Vanity Fair magazine: “His line of bulls**t would change depending on the person he was talking to.“If you didn’t have a connection, he would be like, ‘Yeah, I know the guy. Let me go ahead and call them.’ It was frickin’ amazing.” Suddenly, Gignac had access to a huge global network of the rich and powerful.Together, they set up an investment company, Marden Williamson International LLC, and before long,  wealthy investors had transferred almost £.million into its account.Williamson also introduced the fraudster to a high-profile banker in London.She not only wired through £, of her own money, but also helped him to secure the investors who wired the millions to Marden Williamson International.An investment banker who was one of those to hand over cash, thinking it was for shares in Aramco — soon to be floated on the stockmarket at a value of £.trillion — later admitted: “I was fooled. It was a big, big, big scam.”Emboldened, the bogus Saudi began working on one of his most brazen schemes to date.In March last year, billionaire developer Jeffrey Soffer — then married to supermodel Elle Macpherson — was looking to sell the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel.To his surprise, the prince offered to buy it for £million more than what it was actually worth.Soffer, who was in the middle of finalising his orce from we of four years Elle, jumped at the prospect of the investment from someone he believed to be in “direct line” to the Saudi throne.But before the deal was agreed, the prince let it be known that he expected a certain level of respect.A source told Vanity Fair: “He indicated that one of the customs of his country was to exchange very lavish gts during the negotiation process.”So Soffer showered him with gts, including a £, Cartier bracelet and expensive artwork.The real estate mogul also flew Gignac to Aspen on his private plane for negotiations, where the prince stayed at the luxurious St Regis hotel and spent time at Soffer’s home.Then one night, while out for dinner with the Soffer family, Gignac made his fatal mistake.When choosing his starter, the man who had presented himself as a devout Muslim, ordered pork — asking for the prosciutto.The Soffer family instantly knew something was amiss and had their security team investigate the prince.They soon discovered what they called “key information that this person isn’t what he claims to be”.The Soffers tipped off police and Gignac was eventually arrested at JFK airport in New York last November when he presented a fake passport. He will go on trial in Miami on fraud and identity theft charges in January. A month after his arrest, agents interrogated his colleague Williamson, , for six hours at his home in North Carolina before charging him over the scam.When they left, his we Denise asked Williamsonhe knew the prince was a fraud. He said: “I didn’t know.” She believed him.That night Williamson, the father of two teenage boys, tried to kill himself and died two days later of his injuries.In an obituary, Denise called him a “mediocre domino player, occasional enthusiastic gardener, sore loser and intermittent fashionista”.She added: “My kids and I often cringed at what came out of his mouth, but he was also passionate, caring, had a generous nature and could make me fall down laughing.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Switching to e-cigarettes has helped a signicant number of smokers in their efforts to quit.If there is a genuine desire to help employees stop smoking, smokers should be encouraged to vape, not threatened with the same penalties as those caught smoking.He added: Smoking or vaping, the council is over-reaching its powers.Policing our lestyle, as long as it doesnt have a direct impact on our work or colleagues, is not the business of local government.A spokesman for Unison said: There are clear aspects of this policy we could not agree to.We are usually very supportive of anti-smoking policies.However, people who do smoke need to be able to take breaks and get support from their employer to help them give up.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: The council has revised its smoking policy as we are working to protect the health of employees and also promote positive health messages across the wider community, in line with the agreed Our People Strategy and health and wellbeing framework.A key part of that approach involves discouraging children and young people from taking up smoking.One way to assist that is to reduce the number of adult role models who can be seen smoking in public.Across Dundee, there has been the introduction of voluntary no-smoking areas at childrens play parks and we will be looking to extend this to more open spaces in the future."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000443587543.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pensioner 90 made hundreds of foul mouthed 999 calls demanding pasties and lifts to bingo","story":"Lena Taylor was convicted of making nuisance calls to the emergency services in July, and received a two-year conditional discharge.The -year-old was back in court last month having made another  calls to the emergency services between July  and August , Chronicle Live reports.But the determined OAP, of Wallsend, Tyneside made her hat trick of appearances in the dock this week following a further nine abusive phone calls.Taylor walked free from North Tyneside Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to a malicious communications offence.Lee Poppett, prosecuting, said: Mrs Taylor was abusive during the course of those telephone calls using foul and abusive language and not in fact reporting any emergency incident.The court heard that between July  and August , Taylor had been a great strain on resources and had an ambulance sent to her house on four occasions.Taylor was taken to hospital on one occasion but the other three times she did not need hospital treatment.During one call on July , she rang saying Ive done my dinner, I need someone to take me to bingo to keep me calm.

More than  mounted troops, swords specially sharpened, charged into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. One witness told of women’s heads scythed in half and “tender offshyshyspring drenched in their mothers’ blood”. Others recalled a “most terric shriek” piercing the air and people trampled or pushed into cellars by the panshyshyshyshyicked crowd only to be crushed to death. One truncheon-wielding constable screamed at the pro-democracy demonstrators: “This is Watershyshyloo for you.” Indeed, the carnage was so appalling it was immediately compared with Wellington’s famous,bloody, victory of four years earlier and dubbed “Peterloo”.  For generations it was a footnote in history classes. Children learned of Trafalgar, the defeat of Napoleon and the rise of the British Empire. Only now, thanks to a new film by Mike Leigh, is this seismic moment getshyshyting the attention it deserves. It is hard to believe as you walk round the site in central Manchester that here unfolded one of the most controversial episodes in our history. What was then St Peter’s Fields is now covered with monuments to Victorian prosperity. Right in the middle stands the Midland Hotel where Theresa May and the Cabinet stay when the Tory conference is in town. The narrow streets down which the demonstrators tried to flee only to find themselves in suffocating bottlenecks have been replaced by a plaza in front of the Convention Centre.  The spot where Henry “Orator” Hunt addressed the crowd is now the Radisshyshyson Hotel. Only a small red plaque on the side of the building stands as a reminder to the blood which flowed on that Monday of August , . At least , people, one of largest crowds ever recorded at that date, gathered to challenged the iniquity that a region of , souls did not have a single MP. Weavers, labshyshyourers, artisans, farm hands, women and children – many in their Sunday best – had brought picnics and musical instruments.  They had come to listen to Hunt. His eyes would go red with passion when he spoke about the unfairness of large rapidly growing industrial cities having no representation in Parliament while a handful of voters in ancient, tiny, “rotten boroughs” were able toeasily bribed MPs. When Hunt took to the stage, a couple of carts lashed together, just beshyshyshyshyshyfore pm the magistrates ordered the charge. Dozens of blue-coated soldiers, who had spent the morning drinking after assembling in Pickford’s Yard , rode into the crowd with sabres drawn. The first victim was William Fyles, two, who was trampled to death. Women and children were cut down “inshyshyshydisshyshyshycriminately”, according to one report. One man had his nose sliced off, another was beaten so badly “there was not a place on his back that was not covered with wounds or bruises”.  Socialist historian Michael Herbert says: “People were lying in heaps because they could not escape. There were only narrow streets so there was no way out. “Some fell into cellars and were crushed. The worst was nearest the stage where the crowd was thickest.” Up to  people were killed and an estimated  injured. Ten journalists from across the country were there to witness the barbarity. Every bruise, sabre cut and innocent le lost was recorded for posterity. Thomas Barlow of Middleton was “sabred in the head and much crushed”. John Davenport of Stockport had a bone “the size of half-a-crown” hacked from his forehead and Margaret Downes, “dreadfully cut in the breast”, was “secshyshyreted clandestinely and supposed dead”.  What made the massacre so monshyshystrous was the crowd was peaceful and the attack was authorised in advance. Magistrate William Hulton was not going to allow a gathering of the “lower orders” and their radical cheerleaders. The authorities, as so often before and since, tried to cover up the outrages. Inquests were abandoned and “fake news” planted in sympathetic papers lied about demonstrators attacking troops with stones. Not a single person was convicted. Nobody was ever held to account. Not content with shting the blame, the Government then went on the offensive. Hunt was imprisoned. So, too, was Times journalist John Tyas who desshyshycribed the bloodbath. A stamp tax was introduced to gag newspapers and bans on public assembly were introduced. But did the victims die in vain  Historian Dr Robert Poole believes not. He says: “It was a massive setback but in the end we got most of what the Peterloo generation was after.” Within  years the Great Reform Act was passed, granting Manchester two MPs. However, working people’s struggle for the vote was to last much, much longer. In  males who owned or rented property of a certain value were enfranchised. But it was not until  that all men – and some women over  – got the vote. And women under  had to wait until . Maxine Peake speaks of pride at playing Hillsborough campaigner Anne Williams in ITV drama from creators of BodyguardManchester-raised director Mike Leigh says he was inshyshyshycreasshyshyshyingly aware of the film’s signicance as shooting proshyshygressed. He adds: “Those who were fighting for the vote would be horried to find that  years later we have it but we don’t use it.” Dr Poole puts Peterloo in the same category as Bloody Sunday, Tiananmen Square and the Soweto riots – a sacrice of innocents leading to eventual progress. Others draw parshyshyshyallels with Hillsborough and the miners’ strike in the way the authorities tried to cover up wrongdoing and smear victims. Leigh echoes the sentiment. “It was an important event in the long road to democracy. Some say, ‘So what  It didn’t achieve anything immediately’. “I don’t subscribe to that. It stands as an inspiration to freedom of expression and democracy.

Coffins containing the bones of people laid to rest from  to , with some belonging to influential people in history. Captain Matthew Flinders, one of Britains most prolic explorers, known for being responsible for navigating and naming Australia was buried in the graveyard.  Bill Richmond, the first black boxer to reach international recognition, who travelled from America to England in  was laid to rest in the Camden plot. Lord George Gordon, who in  called for the repeal of the Catholic Relief Act and ato the repression of Catholics. So far, archaeologists have uncovered the bones of , people from the former th and th-century burial ground in what has been branded Britains largest archaeological exploration. Similar digs along the -mile HS route have unearthed Victorian time capsules, Neolithic tools and medieval pottery. The route will explore treasure troves full of prehistoric, roman and world war relics.  The dig in Camden will add to our understanding of how this city transformed, HS officials said. Originally the work was furiously rejected by campaigners in Camden who branded the work to expand Euston station as outrageous. Dorothea Hackman, a local churchwarden who helped to organise the private memorial service, said  people are being allowed to gather at the now-closed St James Gardens to pay respect to the people buried there.  Its quite outrageous they are going to dig up our dead, she said. They shouldnt be disturbed by spurious activities like this. Campaigners have also protested that a memorial service should be held to honor the disturbed dead. As well as upset over the exhumation of the bodies, trees will also be removed to make way for the high-speed rail line.  Anne Stevens, the vicar of neighbouring St Pancras Church, chained herself to one of the trees in January. In retaliation, an HS spokesman said: Though the former burial ground at St James Gardens has not been in use for more than  years, we will ensure that we treat the site with dignity, respect and care. Bosses at HS are working with Historic England, the Church of England and the local parish to plan the reburial of the remains. This is not the first time that the dead have been disturbed at St James Gardens. In August  the burial ground was transformed into public gardens. Then in the late th century a quarter of graves were partly or entirely removed for work on Euston station.

The mini-zoo containing a fox, barn owl and bearded dragon was discovered by chance when meter man executed a warrant for unpaid gas at David Knight and Natalie Keenans Stoke-on-Trent home. He alerted the RSPCA, which sent officers round to investigate a home that stank of neglect, with piles of dog poo in the kitchen, rotting chickens in a snake tank and animals covered in fleas. Sadly, a terrier-typer dog called Lexi was in such a bad state she had to be put down, the Stoke Sentinel reports. North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard that other creatures were being kept in small cages, with barely enough room to move and without ready access to water.  Now -year-old Knight has pleaded guilty to five charges related to animal cruelty, while Keenan has also admitted four offences under the Animal Welfare Act. Hazel Stevens, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said Lexi was experiencing ‘signicant suffering’. She was virtually blind, emaciated with protruding bones, had little fur and an infected tumour that was hidden underneath a ‘foul-smelling mess’. The dog was found curled up on a pile of dirty nappies and had to be carried out of the house as she couldn’t walk. The couple also had a French bulldog called Mocha and a cat called Gizzy, which both had skin and flea problems. As well as a barn owl and fox caged up in separate rooms, a racoon dog, rat, bearded dragon, African grey parrot, five snakes and eight degus were found at the property. The court was told that the menagerie began building up after -year-old Keenan’s father died and she turned to animals for comfort. Charlie had been her dad’s pet and had even acquired his local accent and habit of swearing.  After a rescue centre allowed her to ‘adopt’ the parrot, she soon found other pets to keep them company. The exotic creatures who arrived at the rented property in Sandon Old Road included species that were ‘prey and predator’ and needed specialist care. But they were simply left indoors. Andrew Bennett, representing Knight, said: “They had gone completely overboard – too many animals, too short of space and owners who were suffering on top of that.” Keenan was experiencing mental health problems and felt ‘swamped’. To add to the chaos, the house was in dire need of repair as the ceiling was collapsing and the fridge had flies in it due to electrical problems. The rooms had an accumulation of grime and ingrained dirt and the beds were flea-ridden. Scott Ashdown, representing Keenan, said: “There were also problems with flooding and damp. They went with temporary fixes.” But the court heard that since the animals were removed from the home in November , the couple have managed to get their lives back in order.  Sentencing the pair, District Judge Timothy Boswell told them: “The most signicant mitigation in this case is the progress you have made. The home today is a vast improvement. But he added: “The sheer number of animals whose welfare was ignored fell far below the standard expected.” He disqualied the defendants from keeping animals for three years. They were each handed a -month community order, with a requirement to complete  days of a rehabilitation activity, and both of them must pay pound to help cover the RSPCA’s boarding costs and an pound surcharge. Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Charlotte Melvin recalled feeling physically sick at seeing the state the animals had been living in.  She said: When I arrived at the property the couple wouldn’t let me inside so I waited outside for over two hours until police arrived. “During that time they carried bin bag after bin bag of rubbish out of the house. “When I finally went inside it wasn’t what I was expecting at all. Even though they’d been clearing out for two hours it was still absolutely filthy and the animals were being kept in horrying conditions.  “There was cage after cage and animal after animal. The rooms were strewn with rubbish, all of the animals’ accommodation was filthy and their welfare needs were clearly not being met. “It was disgusting and it was mass-scale neglect.” The French bulldog gained  per cent in body weight within two weeks after being rescued by the RSPCA. Apart from Lexi, all the pets are now in the process of being re-homed.

She said: “I wouldn’t eat breakfast, I would just snack on chocolates and cakes and lunch was like cheese paninis or cheesy pasta’s- I don’t think I had anything without cheese on. “I was Domino’s most loyal customer and would order every Tuesday because it was buy one get one free. “So I would order two large pizzas, either pepperoni and ham and pineapple or margarita and tuna and sweetcorn.  “I would tell my mum that I would keep one for tomorrow, but would then end up eating both in one night.” Claudia - who works part time at a financial advisory firm - said on her way home from work, she would stock up on junk food and then scoff the fatty treats before her tea. She said: “My mum used to say I was addicted to crisps because I would eat two to three big packets a day. “If we ran out in the house I would have to go and buy some more. “Every night I would call in at Tesco and stock up on crisps, sweets and chocolate and then go home, put my pjs on and eat them all.  “And that was as well as eating my tea which would probably be pizza or something with cheese.” But her bad habits soon began to take their toll on Claudia who, aged , dropped out of university and became almost a recluse. She said: “I was so unhappy in myself. “I wasn’t wanting to go out anywhere because I hated having to get dressed up as I knew nothing was going to fit me. “I basically became a recluse. “I was suffering with really low moods and was just in a really bad place. “I just couldn’t do anything I wanted to do, even going up stairs was a struggle and I wouldn’t be able to walk for long periods of time because my legs would hurt from carrying around my weight.”  But it was when she went to the doctors that she was given the shock she needed to make a change. She said: “I was at my heaviest of  stone and I went to the doctors and they basically said I was at risk of all these health problems. “I was at risk of diabetes and they told me my weight could stop me having kids. “They even said I could need knee replacements in the future because my knees wouldn’t be able to hold my body weight. “It scared me. “Because I wanted to be able to go out with my friends and one day have kids and a family and I wasn’t going to be able to do any of these thingsI didn’t lose weight.” Claudia, said she had previously tried “quick fix diets” and had also joined Slimming World once before with her mum in .  However she said this time she was determined and re-joined her local group at the Dove Centre in Formby which is run by consultant Carol Wylie. And she was amazed when the weight began to drop off her. She said: “It was hard to begin with because I was used to being able to eat whatever I wanted but I soon realised I could still have things I liked, just in moderation. “I lost weight quite quickly and was losing half a stone in two weeks and within a year I had lost the majority of my weight.” Claudia has so far dropped an incredible st lb, and now weighs st lb - with her obese frame a distant memory. Even more amazingly she has managed to drop a staggering seven dress sizes and is now a size  . But the biggest change Claudia has noticed in herself is her confidence and her weight loss has allowed her to do something she has always dreamed of. She said: “I have always been interested in performing arts and have sang since I was a young girl. “So when I started to lose the weight I decided to join a dance class and was shocked when I could actually keep up with the others. “I had always wanted to go to university and I know now that it was my weight that jeopardised my course and made me to drop out the first time. “So I applied for a performing arts degree and had to audition and I got offered a place.” Claudia, who is now studying at Edge Hill University, dances twice a week, is part of a cheerleading team and a strength class - and said she is even nearly able to do the splits. She added: “I just love being active now. “My mum used to be the one telling me to get up and do things and now she is telling me to slow down. “But it’s like I can finally do everything I have wanted to do now. “I am trying to make up for lost time and I just want to give everything a go. “I love going out with my friends, whereas before I would make up excuses and shy away from photos but it’s not a problem now. “I love getting dressed up too. I think the only bad thing about my weight loss is the amount of clothes I have bought.” Claudia added: “My friends and colleagues can just see what a better person I am now and how much I have come out of my shell. “I will have banter in work whereas before I just kept myself to myself. “I think my mum is the most proud of me though as she has always wanted me to do it.” And Claudia has some advice for others trying to lose weight. She said: “Join Slimming World, but do it for yourself. “Quick fixes don’t work. “Slimming World makes you change the way you look and feel about food. “The changes I’ve made were so simple – little things like switching white bread for wholemeal and using low-calorie cooking spray instead of lots of oil. “And now I can live my le to my full potential. “No more hiding.” "},{"url":null,"title":"secrets inside abandoned ferrybridge power","story":"Secrets inside abandoned Ferrybridge power station - one of Britains tallest buildings towering over the MMillions of people using the M motorway in West Yorkshire will have seen Ferrybridges huge towers - but photographer Paul Crumpton is one of the few to have ventured insideShareCommentsByTom Howell:,  NOV NewsThe familiar look of the Ferrybridge site Ferrybridge Power Station has been a fixture on the northern industrial landscape for over  years - but will soon be demolished.Millions of people using the M motorway in West Yorkshire will have seen the huge towers - but few will have ventured inside.Photographer Paul Crumpton was one of the lucky ones.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands. And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, , used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs. In total, it is estimated Meghans Down Under tour wardrobe cost pound,. The items of clothing with signicant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghans outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up. The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation  On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the Harriet pair, pictured above. The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry. Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future. He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use. Outlands team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry. It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging. After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gts. One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as iniduals and businesswomen. Thus Meghans Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about. The vegan leather trainers  Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned white Veja V trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games. The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture. Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber. The French fashion brands founders, Seacutebastien Kopp and Franccedilois-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw. So in , they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find. Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes. The recycled plastic bottle pumps  Meghan wore Rothys flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne. The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most politically correct shoes on the planet by Vogue. The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon. The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials. Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity. It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildle. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone. We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.” So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic. The sustainable brand  The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington. The sustainable luxury brand is based on a less is more approach. Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist. She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website. She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them. Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the th anniversary of female suffrage. The empowering dress  Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautul white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light. The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs. The website explains about their collection: Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant. She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

Kate was wearing a poppy for the event, but instead of picking one of the traditional paper versions she wore a very special brooch. She opted for the Women of the First World War Brooch, which has been released by the British Legion this year to honour the memory of the brave women who served and lost their lives.  Each brooch comes with a certicate commemorating the le of a woman who lost her le as a direct result of the First World War. The women in Kates family also played a vital role in the war, with her great-grandmother Olive and her younger sister Anne working as VAD nurses with the British Red Cross. During her visit Kate had the chance to see Olives registration card.  She also read a field service postcard from Lieutenant Lionel M Lupton, her great-great uncle, dated  July , where he writes: I am quite well. He was killed in action on the same day, aged just .  The Women of the First World War Brooches, which cost pound., have been created this year to mark the Centenary year. The British Legions website states: Women played a huge role in the First World War. They served as nurses in the field hospitals, and here at home. They worked in factories, making munitions. They worked on the land. And they were recognised afterwards with the right to vote.   years on, The Royal British Legion have created this special brooch dedicated to the memory of the courageous women who served and lost their le as a direct result of the First World War. Designed exclusively for the Centenary year, this stunning brooch adds a vintage feel to the classic two petal enamel poppy. Plated with a gold tone and hand finished with brilliant baguette crystals, this charming brooch is the perfect way to support The Royal British Legion.

Tereza Burki, , earlier this year won a court case when a judge ruled she had been misled, and was given her money back. But she said the case has given her little satisfaction. She had hoped to find a fulfilling relationship and possibly a fourth child, but Seventy Thirty Ltd failed to deliver. Describing her experience to the Daily Mail , she said: I’m finding it hard right now.  I no longer have dreams. I used to dream of meeting someone, of having a future, when I went to these people. She told the newspaper that material things dont matter so much now, and she fears her child-bearing years are behind her. Ms Burki, a private wealth consultant, said she wanted to believe the Cinderella story when she signed up with the agency. The agency was unable to find her the man of her dreams and possibly the father of her child, she told the High Court. She said the agency assured her it only dealt in creme de la creme matches and could introduce her to bachelors you dream of meeting. When she signed up with the agency in , Ms Burkis requirements for the men she wanted to meet were not modest, Judge Richard Parkes QC said.  She wanted a wealthy man with a lestyle similar or more affluent than her own and, ideally, multiple residences. But the most important factor for Ms Burki, who lives in Cha, where homes sell for millions, was that her soulmate would be prepared to have more children, as she wanted four. But today Mr Parkes ordered the agency to repay her fee, ruling that she had been deceived by Seventy Thirtys then managing director. He told the court: Gertrude Stein quipped that whoever said money cant buy happiness didnt know where to shop. This case is about a woman looking for romantic happiness who says she was tricked into shopping in the wrong place, paying a large sum to a dating which, she says, made promises but failed to produce the goods.  Upholding Ms Burkis claim , he ruled the agencys then managing director, Lemarc Thomas, guilty of deceit in misleading her. Although the agency boasted of more than , members, the truth was that only about  of them were men actively looking for love, he said. And the management consultant would never have paid her money and joined up had Mr Thomas not knowingly given her a wholly  impression. Agency founder, Susie Ambrose, said Seventy Thirty had successfully matched over , lonely hearts and  babies had been born since she set it up in . But the judge said Mr Thomas had told Ms Burki that there were a substantial number of wealthy men on the agencys books, actively looking for matches. She had no means of checking the truth of what he told her, and no reason to doubt it, he added. And she relied on Mr Thomass word before spending a large amount of money on a dating agency in the hope of finding a partner who would give her a fourth child. The Knightsbridge-based agency claimed to have about , active members and that Ms Burki had been sent five potential matches that fit her requirements soon after joining. But the judge said: My conclusion from the evidence is that there are at the very most perhaps  active members of Seventy Thirty, and probably fewer. That points to a maximum of around  active male members. A membership of  active men cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as a substantial number, he continued. The representations made by Mr Thomas were therefore  and misleading. The judge accepted that the agency did have a sizeable database and was not a fundamentally dishonest or fraudulent operation. He emphasised that he had not found that it was not an effective matchmaking agency or that it did not in the event provide Ms Burki with suitable matches. And, had Mr Thomas told her the truth, Ms Burki would have had little cause for complaint. But he added: What I have found is that Mr Thomas ly represented the size of the active membership of Seventy Thirty to Ms Burki and induced her to pay a substantial fee on the strength of his deceit. Had Ms Burki known what the true size of the active membership was, she would not have joined Seventy Thirty. Worried about running out of time to have another child, she felt very let down and disappointed by the fact that Mr Thomass claims for the service turned out to be untrue. And, as well as giving her her money back, the judge awarded her pound for the disappointment and sadness she suffered. Her total award came to pound,. Against that, Ms Burki was ordered to pay Seventy Thirty pound, in libel damages after writing a damning Google review of the agency, describing it as a scam. Ms Burki has not proved that Seventy Thirty lacked the means or intention to operate an effective match making service, let alone that it was engaged in a fraudulent scheme to extract money from its clients for the benefit of its founder the judge ruled. Giving evidence during the case, Miss Burki told the judge: You shouldnt promise people who are in a fragile state of mind, in their mid-s, the man of their dreams. You are entrusting a service you believe is professional, who will take care of your interests and have your best interests at heart.

The teenager was among five boys who targeted Janice as she sat on a park bench in Suffolk in what a court heard was a despicable attack.An image showing them smiling and pointing at their cowering victim sparked widespread revulsion after being posted on Snapchat and Facebook. Until this week, the boys - all between  and  years old at the time - had had their identities protected because of their age. But Semple turned  last week, meaning he could be unmasked for the first time. Speaking out yesterday, the teenager - who pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour - described how he has received death threats from strangers.He told Sun Online: I’m struggling to leave the house at the moment. Since those pictures have gone on Facebook, I’ve had death threats from random people. Askedhe wanted to apologise for the attack in Bury St Edmunds, he reportedly said he was not ready because of the death threats sent to him online.Semple and his friends faced online abuse and direct threats from people who were sickened by the picture after it was shared online. Yesterday, presiding magistrate Simon Islett told the younger members of the group they could have faced jail termsthey were a few years older. He described the incident as a despicable attack on a vulnerable woman and said it was “terrying” for the mum-of-one.Mr Islett told one boy: “She didn’t know what was going to happen or what the outcome was going to be.  You have got to put yourself in the victim’s place and consider your actions and the effect it might have on them.” Janice was sitting in a park when she was approached by Semple and the group. Ipswich Youth Court heard they began asking questions about drugs before one of the boys spat in her face. Prosecutor Wayne Ablett said: He came from behind the bench and spat at her, with spit landing on her face. She said, What did you do that for  She recalls the boy laughing at her, then spitting at her again. Magistrates heard the group disappeared for around  minutes, then ed with flour bought at a nearby shop. Mr Ablett said: These items were chucked at and thrown at her body, covering her completely in flour. The boys were still laughing. She was spat at again and one of them had taken a photo of her. She heard one of them say, Were filming it.  The boys were arrested after the incriminating photo appeared on Facebook in July this year. Janice suffered no physical injuries but was left severely distressed by her ordeal. Semple, who admitted threatening behaviour, lives in Bury St Edmunds with his mum. The court heard since the incident he had received death threats, and felt remorseful and sorry for what happened. Declan Gallagher, defending Semple, said: He took the photograph and put it on his own Snapchat. One of his circle then took a screenshot of that, then it went onto Facebook, then it went beyond. He was released on bail, to be sentenced at an adult court on December . Four other boys, aged , ,  and , admitted the same offence yesterday and were sentenced to -month referral orders. They were also ordered to pay pound each in compensation to the victim. A sixth defendant, aged , denied using threatening behaviour and will face trial at the youth court on February .

Toddler Ellie-May Minshull-Coyle was tied to the mattress of her bed with tight ligatures across her chest and legs and a duvet placed over her, Liverpool Crown Court was told A jury heard how her bedroom had been transformed into a monstrous cage. The window had also been blocked with a mattress and there were no lights. Ellie-Mays mum Lauren Coyle, , and her boyfriend Reece Hitchcott, , were cleared of manslaughter, the Liverpool Echo reported. After almost seven-and-a-half hours of deliberations, the jury found the pair guilty of causing or allowing her death, one count of child cruelty by caging the child in her bed, and another count of child cruelty by restraining her in the bed.  Their lodger, Connor Kirby, , of Liverpool, was found not guilty of all of the charges A post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Alison Armour, a Home Office consultant forensic pathologist, concluded the childs death was caused by forcible restraint by ligatures in a face-down position complicated by hyperthermia. During the trial, prosecutor Christopher Tehrani, QC, read out a series of text messages between Coyle and Hitchcott, which between the couple following Ellie-Mays birth. Hitchcott sent a message which read: I will get it dont worry why the f*** have been like this today i have done f*** all wrong.  Coyle replied: Dont treat me like that bloody let you borrow pound when that could have gone on Ellies trainers. Hitchcott replied: Alright for you to be like that with me wtf Coyle replied: Cant be arsed with it anymore you owe money now pay it. Coyle soon began to complain to her boyfriend that Ellie-May was keeping her awake at night. Her text read: Ellie keeps waking up have to take in living room dont want to go to bed yet. Coyle often messaged her boyfriend while he was at work, the court heard.  On one occasion Hitchcott sent her a message which read: I love you baby this one of the ways it will teach her slowly that she needs to sleep on her own. On February   Coyle posted a message on her Facebook page which read: Finally got my little princess in a routine in her big bed. She is growing up far too fast. Coyle sent a message to Hitchcott which read: Stressed with Ellie. She was biting me so I put her in her room. She is banging her head off the walls. I have smacked her loads too. Hitchcott replied: I will sort her out when I come home. I will put her in her room. Coyle replied: I literally feel like jumping n front of a train. So stressed.  Hitchcott replied: I will sort it out baby. On another occasion Coyle sent a text to her boyfriend which read: There she goes ahead banging her f***ing head again. On March  Coyle sent a message to Hitchcott which read: Ellie playing up again shoved her in her room. Hitchcott replied: She will behave when I am home ha ha. Mr Tehrani also told the court that Ellie-Mays medical condition deteriorated in the months leading up to her death. The toddler suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, and a doctor said that she was suffering from gastroenteritis. The case was adjourned for sentencing at a later date.

Presley and Elias Trejo, from Fort Worth, Texas, welcomed baby girl Emerson Faye on July  but she passed away less than two weeks later after contracting the Herpes Simplex Virus after someone gave her a kiss. Mum Presley took to Facebook to warn others about what can happen when people kiss babies that arent their own.The emotional post, which has been shared more than , times, told of how baby Emerson Faye died after receiving the kiss of death as the virus is particularly harmful to babies because of their weak immune system.  She wrote: Emerson ended up passing away from what is called the HSV- virus. It’s the Herpes Simplex Virus most commonly known as the cold sore virus or the kiss of death for infants. For adults it’s not a big deal. But for infants with little to no immune system, it’s fatal. When someone who has the virus in their system and kisses an infant it can spread rapidly. You can have the virus and not even know you have it. You don’t have to have an active cold sore to pass it on. Presley, who is also mum to two boys, went on to describe how the disease slowly attacked her daughters body. She continued: You shed the virus in your saliva and when it gets on the baby it goes through the body so fast. It attacks the brain first.  It shows up as a type of meningitis. It’s fluid based around the vertebrae and goes straight the the brain. It then spreads to all their organs. It happens so fast that you don’t even know the baby is sick. In Emerson’s case, when we arrive to the hospital, her liver was completely gone. Her kidneys were right behind. Everything was failing. She was having multiple seizures until she was brain dead. Her heart stopped beating and the only thing that kept her alive were machines. My daughter, my own flesh and blood who I created out of love, was on le support and I had to be the one to pull the plug on her le. A mother should never ever have to bury their child. The virus took her at just  days old and we watched her die a very slow death. And now I have a letime without her. Presley then delivered a stark warning to others and said she decided to share her story in order to raise awareness. She added: Everyone needs to know about this virus and what it does to children and their families! PEOPLE!!!! STOP KISSING BABIES THAT ARE NOT YOURS!!!!! WAS YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU ARE AROUND NEWBORNS!!!!! I have seen stories about other infants passing from this same virus but you never think it’s going to happen to you. Well this time, it did. My babies don’t have their sister and my husband and I lost our only little girl.  Doctors don’t see this very often. There’s not a lot of cases on this but it’s starting to sp and more. And now it happened right here to us. Our perfectly healthy, happy, BEAUTIFUL angel is no longer here with us because of a terrible virus that people need to be more aware of. People need to know about this sickness. This is a serious and dangerous illness. Do your part, stop kissing babies and start washing your hands. These babies don’t deserve it. Emerson didn’t deserve it. I, as a mother and we, didn’t deserve it. My husband and kids don’t deserve it. And now we will live a whole le time of what ’s. I will never see her go to kindergarten, graduate high school or college, my husband will never walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, I will never see her be a better mother than me. It’s not fair!! We should have never had to go through this. I love you Emerson Faye. I will carry on your name and your love till eternity. I will never forget you. I will never stop loving you.

Little Triniti Harrell was playing with her mother, Miranda Harrell, in their front yard when their pet dog suddenly attacked and began thrashing her around. In a harrowing  call, a distraught Miranda, from North Carolina, US, could be heard telling the operator, He wont stop!, and Help me, shes dying! After being instructed to do so by the operator, she then bravely ran inside her home, grabbed a kne and tried to slit the throat of the six-year-old pitbull. But heartbreakingly, she could be heard crying: This kne is too dull.  Triniti died in hospital days after the attack last week, WRAL reports. And in the aftermath of the tragedy, veterinarian Brett Levitzke has revealed one little-known move that could help people stop dog attacks. If you pick them up by the hind legs theyre off balance, their first reaction may be to let go and then turn around, he told Inside Edition. There is no suggestion this action could have saved Trinitis le. Other experts have previously said punching the dog in the nose and the muzzle, distracting it with an item of clothing or an accessory, or using your entire body weight on the animal to break its bones could help in the event of an attack. The horric incident on October  could only be stopped when the pitbull was shot dead by an Edgecombe County deputy - who had to fire at it twice.  This was despite Miranda and the  operators efforts to save Triniti. In a recording of the emergency call, the operator asks Miranda: Can you get hold of anything - a pot, pan, shovel, anything youve got around your house  He then tells her to whack the dog right in the centre of the top of his head. He adds: If you hit him hard enough, youll knock him out. But devastatingly, Miranda yells back: He wont stop! The operator continues: Find something and hit him with it. The mum responds: Im hitting him as hard as I can. She then screams a long cry of desperation: Help me! In a last-ditch bid to save Triniti, the dispatcher instructs Miranda to dash into her home in Rocky Mount and grab a weapon like a steak kne.  After the mother replies that she cant leave her daughter alone, he says: It will take you  seconds to run in the house and grab it. He then adds: I need you to go find a kne immediately. The mother replies: OK. After grabbing a kne, she is then told to slit the bottom of her pets neck. The dispatcher says: Grab him by one ear and cut along the bottom of his neck. Hes going to let go. Its going to release his jaw muscles. He tells Miranda the animal wont have a choice but to let go. However, despite her efforts to cut her dog, the mum finds the blade too dull. As she pleads again for help, the operator tells her he needs her to do anything she can do with the weapon to make the pet let go. The dogs le is not a concern to me at this point, he says.  The recording then comes to an end. Triniti was rushed to hospital after the terrying attack. But despite the efforts of medics at UNC Childrens Hospital in Chapel Hill - and other hospitals - to save her le, she passed away just days later. Edgecombe County Sherf Clee Atkinson confirmed her mother had tried to stab the pitbull before a deputy shot it dead at the scene. Speaking to WRAL News after the tragedy, Miranda said: I did all I could. Sherf Atkinson said: Its just one of those incidents. They were playing, having a good time, and the dog reacted at some point. Triniti - who was laid to rest by her loved ones earlier this week - is not the only person to have fallen victim to a dog attack in recent weeks.  In the West Midlands, a teenage girl was reportedly left with her lip hanging off after being savaged by a dog as she walked home from school. Chloe Lloyd, , is said to have suffered le-changing injuries after she was attacked by the animal on Ellerton Walk, Wolverhampton, last month. Her mother Claire Forrester said there was blood everywhere. The same month, a -year-old man was left in a coma after his genitals were ripped off and eaten by a bulldog named Biggie Smalls. The man, who has not been named, was found lying unconscious inside a flat by emergency crews in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland. It was later reported he had apparently smeared his crotch in peanut butter. And yesterday, footage emerged showing a pitbull launching an attack on a Siberian husky at a dog show in Chiang Mai, Thailand, leaving it bloodied.

In a study released on Thursday, astronomers at the Hard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics published their observations of an interstellar object known as Oumuamua. According to the scientists, the rock - which is the first observed to enter our star system from another - received an unexpected boost in speed as it passed through the inner solar system last year. Because the object seems to exhibit qualities associated with both asteroids and comets, the astronomers have speculated its unusual acceleration might be as a result of a light sail of articial origin being pushed by solar radiation. The study Could Solar Radiation Pressure Explain Oumuamuas Peculiar Acceleration  was conducted by Shmuel Bialy, a postdoctoral researcher at the CfAs Institute for Theory and Computationand Professor Abraham Loeb, the director of the ITC, the Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science at Hard University. In the report the astronomers wrote: Considering an articial origin, one possibility is that ‘Oumuamua is a light sail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment.  The asteroid was first spotted by the Haleakala observatory in Hawaii on October  last year. The strange cigar-shape of the object and its unusual behaviour led many to speculate that it might be an alien artefact. In the year since debate has raged in the scientic community as to whether ‘Oumuamua is a comet or an asteroid. The object appeared to speed up as it left the solar system - suggesting it had omitted materials from its surface after being heated by the Sun in a way consistent with a comet.  However, because it did not go through a similar process when it was closest to the Sun, Bialy and Loeb have argued it is in fact a light sail - a form of spacecraft that relies on radiation pressure to generate propulsion Loeb told Universe Today: Oumuamua could be an active piece of alien technology that came to explore our Solar System, the same way we hope to explore Alpha Centauri using Starshot and similar technologies. The alternative is to imagine that `Oumuamua was on a reconnaissance mission. The reason I contemplate the reconnaissance possibility is that the assumption that `Oumumua followed a random orbit requires the production of ~^ such objects per star in our galaxy.  Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawaiis Institute of Astronomy and co-author of the study, suggested that dust grains on the surface of most comets had eroded away during ′Oumuamuas journey through interstellar space. She said: The more we study ′Oumuamua, the more exciting it gets. Im amazed at how much we have learned from a short, intense observing campaign. I can hardly wait for the next interstellar object! Oumuamua is less than half a mile inand is currently traveling away from the Sun at about , mph as it heads toward the outskirts of the solar system. In another four years, it will pass Neptunes orbit on its way back into interstellar space.

The news of the birth, which emerged in September, was followed by claims last month that fish and other forms of le are quickly filling up Dead Sea sinkholes.Hebrew prophet Ezekiel’s end-of-days prophecy foresees the sea - a hypersaline environment, with a reported  per cent salinity - flourishing into le. And a photojournalist with the Dead Sea Revival Project said that coming to the body of water, the lowest point on earth, you see prophecy coming true.  The third strange occurrence took place this week, when a snake was filmed slithering out of Israels Western Wall, unexpectedly interrupting prayers. Footage showed the reptile scaring away a pigeon - with some Internet users deeming it a sign that a prophecy about the Messiahs coming will soon be fulfilled.While countless end of the world conspiracy theories have fallen flat over the decades, some claim that the beginning of the end will actually begin in .The trio of signs have all emerged in the past few months. Below are the happenings that have sparked prophecy fulfilment claims  Birth of first red heer in  yearsTwo months ago, it emerged that a red heer had been born in Israel.The Temple Institute announced the birth via YouTube, and said the calf and her mother would undergo extensive examination to determineshes blemish free. It said the red calf brings the promise of reinstating Biblical purity to the world. Red heers feature in end of times tales, with the birth and sacrice of the red cow said to precede the construction of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. In mainstream Orthodox Judaism, the rebuilding of the Temple will happen before the coming of the Jewish Messiah. The two previous temples have been destroyed.  The Temple Institute and other organisations have been established with the goal of building the Third Temple on Mount Moriah or the Temple Mount. However, some theologians believe the construction of the Third Temple is linked to Judgement Day or the end of times. After “extensive examination of the calf, rabbinical experts are said to have confirmed she is a “viable candidate for the Biblical red heer”. Breaking Israel News reported a board of rabbis veried she fulfilled the requirements of the prophecy - which says the cow must be red without blemish. Fish spotted in the Dead Sea It is said that the Dead Seas high salinity prevents fish from living in it.However, marine le has reportedly been spotted in the seas sinkholes.Scientists are said to have been shocked to discover the sinkholes rapidly filling up with fish and other forms of le that never used to be sighted.Israeli photojournalist Noam Bedein said the body of water is anything but dead, telling Breaking Israel News that it is the “eighth wonder of the world.”  He has reportedly seen fish in the sinkholes - and witnessed growing vegetation. Ezekiel, a priest and prophet who appears in the Old Testament, foresaw the Dead Sea flourishing into le in his end-of-times prophecy.According to Ezekiel : -, there shall be a very great multitude of fish. And Mr Bedein said: A place that was once cursed in Biblical times, now you can come here to the Dead Sea, explore the sinkholes and see fish where the water has receded – fulfilling prophecies from Ezekiel who talked about the land flourishing and blooming when the Jews .  Snake wriggles out of the Western Wall A snake was spotted crawling out of the stones of Israels Western Wall on Wednesday night, causing some panic among worshippers. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation released video footage of the reptile emerging from one of Judaisms holiest sites, the Times of Israel reports.During the incident, the snake reportedly scared away a pigeon - which some bloggers have claimed is a symbol that we are living in dangerous times.They say these times lead up to the coming of the Messiah.  Some Internet users have also drawn connections to the serpent that tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, according to the Bible.According to Ynet news site, the snake that slithered out of the walls stones was likely trying to fatten itself up for the winter months.

I’m not saying we are perfect but we have nothing to hide.“If people smell anything they can easily come in past and ask for myself and people can come see the work we have done in the factory.”Scottish Water had previously told the Evening Express it has undertaken CCTV investigations of the sewage network, but had found no defects in the sewers that would cause a foul odour.At the meeting it was agreed that Scottish Water would share data of its investigation with PDCC at a future meeting.A call was made at the meeting by all four of the North Kincardine councillors that Environmental Health at Aberdeenshire Council should look to play a leading role.A spokesman for the local authority said: “Following the meeting Aberdeenshire Council confirmed it will co-ordinate efforts to eliminate the odour.“Sepa are the enforcing authority for emissions from the factory and Aberdeenshire Council’s environmental health team has responsibility for potential sources outwith the factory boundary.“While the source of the odour remains unclear, the council will endeavour to support partner agencies in their investigations going forward and will provide regular updates to the community council.“Residents were reminded at the meeting to report any foul odours when they occur, so that relevant officials can visit the scene to witness it and investigate.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/5bcd64bbc0e26-846x564.jpg ","title":"kind staff to sleep out","story":"An engineering firm is hoping to raise £, from a sleep-out event to help eradicate homelessness.Wood PLC has pledged to take part in the Sleep in the Park event at Duthie Park in December, with all proceeds going to social enterprise Social Bite.The company is hoping to bring in £, from  staff taking part, which will be used to fund Housing First, an initiative which offers wrap-around care for people who are sleeping rough.Housing First will be rolled out in five cities across Scotland, partially funded by both the Scottish Government and Social Bite.Dave Stewart, CEO of asset solutions business across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia at Wood, said: “I found out about it through some of my colleagues in the oil and gas sector, then by the time I had got in touch with our head of marketing about taking part, some of my colleagues had already met the founder of Social Bite, Josh Littlejohn, and signed up.“So I’m not quite sure whose idea it was, but they beat me to the punch.”He added: “We’re looking to raise about £,, and we’re hoping that  of us will take part. It’s such a great cause we’re really hoping we can get at least that amount of staff and families to get involved.“Social Bite’s programme that’s looking to eradicate rough sleeping in Scotland, whether it be the village that they’ve set up in Edinburgh or the fact they’ve given out , food items in the past year, is really excellent.“All the things Social Bite is looking to do to eradicate rough sleeping in this country, then we’re strongly behind it.”The sleep-out event coincides with the relaunch of Wood’s corporate values. Dave said: “Our new values are around care, courage and commitment, and I think it’s going to take a lot of courage and commitment to spend the night outside in the freezing cold. This is a tough thing to do. When you walk past homeless people in cities all across Scotland you can really see how tough it is for them.”Stirling, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh will all benefit from the programme, which has seen more than  properties released to be given to homeless people with complex needs.The programme offers support alongside housing, including help with drug and alcohol addictions or mental health issues."},{"url":null,"title":"msp scottish government and contractors should bash heads together to get awpr sections open","story":"The Scottish Government and contractors should “bash their heads together” to get AWPR sections open as soon as possible, opposition politicians have said today.In a heated debate about the £ million project at Holyrood yesterday, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson confirmed the Craibstone to Stonehaven section is physically complete but cannot open due to a legal wrangle between the SNP minority-led Scottish Government and contractors.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald said the two organisations need to overcome the red tape for the good of Aberdeen residents.He said: “The contractor and the Scottish Government administration need to bash their heads together to get this sorted out.“Both parties need to end that dispute urgently to get the road open as soon as possible.”Mr Macdonald’s plea was backed by the Conservative co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, Douglas Lumsden, who said: “He is definitely right.“Mr Matheson appeared to be saying the Craibstone South section is physically complete, so all that is left to deal with is the issue between the Scottish Government and contractor.”Once complete, the AWPR is expected to boost the north-east economy by more than £ billion and create more than , jobs in the next  years.Mr Matheson said he wanted the contractor to resolve the contractual issues “sooner rather than later”.He added: “It’s time for the contractor to stop deliberating and start acting and get this section of road open.”North-east Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles criticised the SNP for “evading responsibility” for the completion delay.“They have put it down to the contractors, the weather and public safety.

There is no provision for it to be simply opened. There’s a clear way we can resolve this matter through a iation and we’ve been pursuing that for a considerable period of time now.”When asked why the contractor was reluctant to make the changes to the contract, Mr Matheson said: “That’s a question which you will need to put to them.”Throughout the duration of the project, contractors have refused to comment directly to the press due to the “partnering nature” of the project, with all requests instead being put to the government agency Transport Scotland.When pressed on a definitive opening date, Mr Matheson said they couldn’t be “firm” about the time frame but said contractors believe the whole route could be open by December, adding that would “hopefully” be the case. He said: “At this stage it is dependent on a number of factors. The weather could have an impact.”He told MSPs that the Scottish Government’s “primary responsibility” must be to ensure these works are completed safely to the required quality standards.He added the River Don Crossing section would not open until Transport Scotland officials were confident this is the case, with the contractor working hard to repair the defects and ARL working to identy a new date for when the bridge will be ready."},{"url":null,"title":"tune up for christmas with ee carol concert special show","story":"The countdown is on to the popular Evening Express Carol Concert – which will mark its th anniversary next month.Each year talented youngsters from schools and clubs across the north-east lead the festivities to get everyone in the Christmas spirit.Taking place at the historic Music Hall, it will be the first major concert at the venue since its £ million refurbishment.Hundreds of youngsters will take to the stage for the th year of the concert on Sunday December .Former Torry Academy head teacher and organiser Jenny Cranna said she could not wait for the event.She added: “It is fantastic to be part of the th celebrations of the carol concert.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh. After three Spanish songs by Joaquin Rodrigo during which the audience was told stories of a youthful girl’s wish to be picked as a companion for the king and a miller#s we staying true to her husband although her offer may be tempting, the two performed three of Granados  Tondillas. This was followed by a sentimental and personal depiction of Spain in Granados ‘Dance Española’s No.’ played by Sasha Savolini.McNeill and her partner finished with two Spanish songs by Turina, the first being an earthy and dramatic prayer to the virgin of hope and the second a feisty scorned woman with underlaying tones of sadness. Yet the audience was surprised to an encore of a beautully soft rendition ‘St Columba’s Prayer’.This was an entertaining afternoon enjoyed by everyone in Ardrishaig Public Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"etive tests loch fyne anglers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowLoch Fyne Sea Angling Club held its annual #blind pairs# competition out of Airds Bay on Loch Etive recently in testing conditions.The strong wind and heavy rain made it a dficult day for the anglers, but they made the best of it fishing from the small self drive boats.Loch Etive produced the usual species of spurs, whiting and dogfish with a total of  fish caught and ed.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm. Extra s would be .am, .am, .am, .pm and the .pm to Doonfoot.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnGlasgowAyrKilmarnockTroonPrestwickCumnockAyr NewsStagecoach"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors.

It was no more than United deserved for another battling display on the road and keeps them firmly in touch with leaders Ross County at the summit. Heres three things we learned on another big afternoon for the Honest Men: Rose rises to the occasion Hes been immense for Ayr at the back this season but Michael Rose was the hero at the other end today and he climbed to power home Uniteds deserved winner. The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

by pupils as they make the transition into the world of work, and challenges faced by education in keeping up with an ever-changing curriculum.It is hoped the employers take this learning back to the workplace and use it to inform recruitment and retention plans for the future workforce.Earlston headteacher Justin Sinclair said: \"It was wonderful to welcome our visitors from SPPA to Earlston High

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

There are parts of the country where you could go where there is a desperate need for social housing.ldquoThere is social housing here and therersquos a responsible housing department and good housing associations and we are working very much as part of that mix.

The level of rent that these facilities house is what East Lothian needs.ldquoThis is a step in the right direction but letrsquos hope itrsquos a springboard for a lot more.ldquoWe need as many affordable properties as we can.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them.

proposed community business.A form has been released to assess non-binding expressions of interest in order to gauge the level of funding that might be raised.The vision for the Community Carrot is to develop the existing ethos of the Crunchy Carrot: a strong social, ethical and environmentally friendly focus, sourcing locally where possible, with many of the existing staff expected to remain.Funds raised would finance the purchase and refurbishment of the shop, and suggestions are being sought for additional ideas to give the business a new lease of le.The steering group is being supported by

Our proposal is that growth should not be so easy in the future. Itrsquos about restricting growth, not sort of getting rid of what there is already.Mr Manning continued: ldquoIf you talk about what the sectors are that we want to grow as a share of employment in the UK, you would not be focusing on hospitality as one of those sectors.\"He said it was ldquonot obvious migration had contributed to making Scotland a high wage, high productivity economy.And he argued the hospitality industry needed ldquoa little bit of pressure to boost its productivity and provide better paid jobs. Making migration harder would be ldquoan appropriate nudge to go down that route, he said.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said it was ldquoutterly incredible to hear Mr Manning belittle the jobs of those who work in the sector.She said: ldquoMr Manningrsquos comments on the quality of jobs in the hospitality sector are arrogant and dismissive of the great work we do.ldquoThe sector is incredibly dynamic and vibrant.

Theresa May has already announced that there will be a Festival of Britain following Brexit to showcase British achievement and last month it was revealed that a special commemorative p piece will be minted. The UK Government, fortied by the press and the BBC, is already putting in place all the accoutrements that have previously served them well in distorting reality. The royal family will have received their orders. Irsquom expecting another couple of royal babies and Andrew and Fergie to renew their wedding vows. If Philip continues to be spared theyrsquoll maybe give him Manchester to go with Edinburgh.Those who smile condescendingly at such merrymaking in expectation of the day when the Brexit dream turns to dust and the people turn to a socialist government in despair, will have a long wait. Donrsquot delude yourselves. This day has been long in the making and represents the ultimate dream of the Conservative Party when all their strategies and grand designs evolved over centuries come to fruition. With Brexit what wersquore seeing is a distillation of the entire rationale and philosophy of the Tories and their approach to society.Previously, they had been able to conceal the selfishness and greed that has always been the essence of their belief structure with the help of an elaborate and sophisticated confidence trick. More than two centuries of military engagement produced the warrior heroes required to subscribe to the fiction that wersquove always been in this together. The royal family and lately a world-class broadcasting arm with global reach has ensured that the idea of unity, even amongst the worst rates of economic and health inequality, has been able to fly.When I was young I could never understand why a large percentage of the British working class could vote in the numbers required toa Conservative government. Itrsquos not the aristocrats and the affluent who are responsible for electing them ndash there simply arenrsquot enough of them ndash itrsquos the people who have suffered most at the hands of traditional Tory policies who continue to vote them in.For centuries the Tories fought hard to keep those whom they considered beneath them shut out from power and a share in Britainrsquos great wealth. Now the children and grand-children of the dispossessed are effectively keeping their ancestorsrsquo gaolers in power. Only a very powerful coalition of interests working closely together can maintain the lie required to hoodwink almost an entire class.Just as fear and suspicion of immigrants and foreigners was exploited by the architects of Brexit to achieve the desired result so the same targets will be used for shting the blame when the apocalypse dawns. There might have been a chance to achieve a workable Brexit deal with our European partners but this would have required an element of respect from the British negotiators. Instead, the Conservative deal-makers, from the outset, have branded the remaining  EU nations as obstructive and as consumed by a spirit of vengeance. By the time this softening-up process has concluded many in the UK will have been persuaded that the EU activated Article  and threw us out of their club.This is a convenient fiction which will come to serve a crucial purpose: it delivers the required scapegoat when the food and medicine shortages become apparent and when holidays and trips to Europe become an ordeal. The millions of EU citizens who reside here and any unfortunates from further afield will have a torrid time. This, in turn, feeds the other great obsession of the Brexiters: taking back our laws as well as our borders. The ability to frame workplace legislation weighted in favour of the corporate elites to make it easier to practice summary justiceto stop, search and imprison on a whim: this is the greatest prize of all.Next week Mike Leighs historical epic recalling the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in  will be released.

To be a parentin todayrsquos Scotland means accepting governmental regulation of your own family le in a way quite unknown to previous generations. Think, for example, of recent Government-approved efforts to stand between parents and their young children on the issue of gender self-identication the Governmentrsquos increasing regulation of parental discipline the unpopular drive to test early primary schoolers against their parentsrsquo wishes or the widely disliked Named Person scheme. In each of these, a paternalistic state projects its own programme and worldview into homes up and down the land, treating its own preferences and idiosyncrasies ndashhowever arbitrary and flimsy ndash as normative for us all. In the process, this ldquocorporate parent undermines each real-world familyrsquos authority in regulating its own affairs according to its own norms and values.If the Scottish Government wants to support parents, it should stop talking about itself ndash and crucially, acting ndash as a parliamentary parent to the nation. To speak of any state, politician, or party as a ldquocorporate parent is to make a basic category mistake. The family unit and the democratic state are quite dferent things. By confusing them, our Government imperils both.In many ways, the familyis a profoundly undemocratic institution. We do not choose our parents. Rather, they are chosen for us in the accident of birth, or in the process of adoption. For good or ill, our link to our parents is lelong and indelible. And despite the fact that we have not chosen them, our parentshave le-defining responsibilities over us. They are tasked with teaching us to love, moulding our characters, and giving us a view of the world. In taking up this herculean challenge, every parent carries out a common responsibility in a unique way. For that reason, the family next door will never be quite like your own, because every family unit isa one-off melting pot of histories ndash cultural, personal, and genetic ndash and hopes for the future. A family can run along lines that are compelling and unassailable to its own members, but that make little sense to their neighbours. And that is no bad thing, because the family, so undemocratic for its youngest members, is one of the most basic building blocks in a healthy democracy.The stateis very dferent to the family. It should be a thoroughly democratic institution. In a liberal democracy, we choose our politicians because they promise to represent us, in all our grassroots ersity. We elect them to do so ndash hopefully ndash because we already know who we are, not because we want them to decide who we must become. And should they fail to represent us well, our democracy also means we can vote them out. They are in office to represent their constituents as public servants, not corporate mothers or fathers.In its paternalism, our Government often talks about love as its motivation, or as the thing it will promote in Scotland. This is quite a responsibility to assume. As an example of this, the First Ministerrsquos speech highlighted her commitment to ldquoseeing love be the foundation and underpinning in what is wrapped around every child in Scotland. While this is a noble aim, it is not something a ldquocorporate parent, armed merely with statutes and political might, could ever achieve. Love is much better felt than telt. It cannot be created or kept alive by legislative action. Loversquos very nature makes plain that while politics is important in the promotion of human flourishing, its power is not infinite.If our politicians want to support Scottish parents and children, and promote love as a normal childhood experience, they must remember their limits. They are public servants and elected representatives of those whose social institutions ndash in this case, the family ndash have a power wholly dferent to their own. It is hard to promote love and encourage parentsthose parents feel that their state assumes they do not know how to parent, and where the uninvited ldquocorporate parent becomes an increasingly demanding figure in the home.As a child, I learned two civic virtues ndash one regarding the family, and the other, politics ndashwhich were ingrained at school and in the home. On the family, I was taught that ye cannae shove yer granny aff a bus for one simple reason: rsquocause shersquos yer mammyrsquos mammy. And on politics, I was taught to vote according to my own conscience at every available opportunity, because enfranchisement empowers the people. If those lessons were correct, a ldquocorporate parent is not just unnecessary. It is also an impossibility.Dr James Eglinton is Meldrum Lecturer in Reformed Theology at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"two-lanes-closed-on-m77-near-newton-mearns-due-to-overturned-horse-box-with-two-animals-inside","story":"The road is affected between junctions  and due to the incident, and motorists are advised to approach with caution, as well as expect delays.Severe weather warnings are alsoin place until midnight as heavy rain batters Glasgow.#Due to overturned horsebox M southbound closed prior to jct ,traffic moving slowly on hard shoulder.Radio Clyde reports that there are two horses inside, and that recovery is ldquolikely to take until around lunchtime.TrafficScotland is advising that journey times are likely to take longer than normal.The condition of the horses is not yet known."},{"url":null,"title":"travel-disruption-as-glasgow-central-services-replaced-by-buses-on-sunday","story":"Network Rail engineerswill be upgrading the lines running between Glasgow Central and Newton Neilston and Kilmarnock and East Kilbride throughout the day, with replacement bus services running for the duration.Passengers planning to travel from Glasgow Central to stations including Barrhead, Clarkston, Crossmyloof, Pollokshaws West, Gfnock and Thorntonhall will be affected.#### Travelling through the red line  Due to Network Rail structural works, buses will replace trains between Glasgow Central and Newton Neilston.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmA five-try showing from Orkney RFC sealed a third win on the bounce, beating Hillhead Jordanhill -.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach. It’s a particularly impressive atmosphere when the tide is high and the weather rough.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold.

Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

It may be two months until the big day but Christmas is already taking shape in the centre of Edinburgh.It gets a little earlier each year. There was a time when Remembrance weekend marked the start of the transformation. After the red crosses were removed from Princes Street Gardens, the gingerbread houses of the Christmas Market started to appear.A few years ago, the Garden of Remembrance moved to allow for construction of a funfair ride but still not much happened before Halloween. Now the last week of October marks the start of the relentless commercialisation of the city centre. Is it a coincidence that the felling of trees in Princes Street Gardens was done just in time to create extra space for the Christmas market  It certainly seems convenient.But there is a more fundamental question facing anyone who lives in Scotland’s capital city. What’s it all for Edinburgh council will say it is for the benefit of locals and visitors but how do they know that  While the extension of the tram line to Newhaven seems to require endless consultation, who knows what the people of Edinburgh want the city centre to be : Some people might want it to be an entertainment theme park with non-stop festivals and endless opportunities to eat and drink. Others might just want it to be a place where people can live, work and shop unhindered. The point is, it would be nice to be asked. At the centre of it all is the Edinburgh Festival. For the month of August, the city becomes a stage and that is a wonderful thing.But the reward for putting up with all the congestion and disruption was traditionally  months of relative normality. Not any more. Nowadays Edinburgh’s Christmas consists of weeks of commercialisation with pop-up stalls where you can buy everything from sugar mice to wooden toys but mostly it is about selling booze.Edinburgh now has  festivals scattered across the calendar. The one gap that remained was after Hogmanay but even that is now being plugged by a new Burns Festival at the end of January which aims to attract thousands of participants to the city centre. That will make  festivals across the year. Unlucky for some. : Edinburgh’s Christmas market named best in UKWhile Edinburgh grows its reputation as a playground, the city centre population is falling as more and more inhabitants decide they cannot stand the endless disruption. Instead the city now has , short-term let properties listed on Airbnb.The row over fencing being erected around Princes Street Gardens for a concert this summer showed that increasing commercialisation and free access to the public realm is an increasing area of conflict.As one of the fastest growing cities in the UK, Edinburgh needs to decide how it wants the future to be. If we want the city to be a stage for non-stop commercial events, we are going about it the right way.Butwe want it to be a real living and working city for local people, we need to halt the race to make money from every space every month of the year.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4823708.1541164808!/image/image.jpg","title":"david cameron is wrong to think he can make comeback leader comment","story":"Former Prime Minister David Cameron reportedly wants toto politics because he is #bored#, but he should # at the very least # wait until the full effects of Brexit become clear.Shortly after David Cameron became Prime Minister in , a regular Ipsos-Mori poll on the most important issues facing Britain recorded its lowest ever score for the one that ultimately led to his downfall.Just one per cent of those surveyed felt the EU was a pressing concern and the figure was well below ten per cent when Cameron decided to call a referendum on Britain’s membership. Last month,  per cent rated the EU and Brexit as one of the UK’s most important issues, while economy, education and crime all took a back seat on less than  per cent. Such figures have led some to the belief that Cameron manufactured a national crisis out of nothing – apart from decades of infighting within the Conservative party – then departed too swtly, leaving others to clean up the mess.However, he is now reportedly planning ato politics as he is “bored s***less” – perhaps not the reason he would pitch to a Conservative constituency association’s selection committee – and has the post of Foreign Secretary in mind.

William Hague was leader when the party lost the  election, but was Foreign Secretary from  to .However, while both politicians were damaged by failure, unlike Cameron these were not defeats of their own making. They were still well regarded by many in the party’s ranks. It goes without saying that the Brexiteers are not Cameron’s biggest fans, but Tory Remainers were hardly falling over themselves to welcome him back yesterday. The Conservative Home website’s daily news round-up relegated the story to an “And finally ...” item.That left it to Labour politicians to give the verdict, with Yvette Cooper MP tweeting: “You ripped up our closest international partnership.

This will allow us to make further progress with the review of procurement policy for future ferry operating contracts.“Our ferry services are iconic transport links that play a vital role for our island economies.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking.

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

McConnell said he was ‘really shocked’ when the Bishop of Connor, the Rt Rev Alan Abernethy, contacted him.“I am honoured that the Bishop thought of me.“It is recognition that I have been in ministry for more than  years, and is also a great encouragement for me.“This is doubly special because Lisburn Cathedral is the parish church in which I was born and raised for the first  years of my le.“That is quite something. Lisburn Cathedral is where the seeds of faith were sown and where I felt the first call to ordination.”After A Levels, Mark joined the Northern Ireland Civil Service where he worked for more than seven years, ending up in IDB House where his job was to encourage exports from Northern Ireland overseas.In his mid-s, Mark felt a strong calling to commit more to his faith.He said: “I didn’t see ordination as the way forward but wanted to know more about faith and Christian service.This led him to Oakhill College in north London.He continued: “The structure allowed people to find their direction within the studies.“This could have been anything from youth ministry to army chaplaincy or evangelism.”It was during his three years at Oakhill Mark decided ordination was for him. Halfway through the course, he began contacting bishops.“St Alban’s Diocese took me under their wing. They accepted me for ordination training in the Church of England.“God opened doors for me.”.After graduation from Oakhill, Mark had the opportunity to do a familiarisation year on his way to ordination, and he did this at St James’ Parish, Muswell Hill, north London, where he had the opportunity to do anything that needed doing!During that year he married Cherith, a native of Omagh and a primary school teacher.Mark was ordained in St Alban’s Diocese and served his first curacy in Christ Church, Bedford.He and Cherith felt called back to Northern Ireland, and Mark became accustomed to the ways of the Church of Ireland through a second curacy in Bangor Parish, Diocese of Down and Dromore. During this time he did a lot of work with the congregation of The Primacy, a small church on a large housing estate shared with the Methodist Church.Mark was later appointed rector of Killyleagh in Co Down, and after seven years moved to Connor Diocese as rector of Ballyclare.He remained in Ballyclare for more than  years before the move to Ballymena, where he currently ministers along with his we Cherith and their three children, Daniel, Matthew and Erin.A date for his installation to the Chapter of St Saviour has yet to be set, but Rev McConnell will continue to be rector of the Ballymena Parish while a Canon of Lisburn Cathedral.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice. We are committed to keep that pledge.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"devine hoping to soar in russia","story":"BELFAST Gymnastics star, Ryan Devine departs for Russia this weekend to compete in the World Championships fresh from winning his maiden British title. The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"historical treasure trove revealed at clifton house","story":"THE BELFAST Charitable Society has uncovered a suitcase of letters and material from World War One while preparing for its autumn series of lectures. letters tell the story of Irish Pfficer Patrick Dixon’s le at the front during the war through correspondence with his parents in upper middle class Dublin.Paula Reynolds, CEO of the Belfast Charitable Society, said: “Our colleague and volunteer, Jim McFerran, has been tirelessly working his way through the Dixon family papers ensuring they are all documented and sorted appropriately.“When our Archive and Heritage Officer unearthed the letters we were astonished at first of all the amount of the material, as well as the condition of it.” Aaron McIntyre, Archive and Heritage Officer at Clton House, said: “These letters and material are of great importance and we are very excited about their signicance. It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time. We’d also like to find the descendants of Patrick Dixon and we would like help in tracing members of the Dixon or Wynne families who may be able to shed light on this incredible collection of war letters.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-09.52.44.png","title":"last chance to cast your vote for our inspirational youth","story":"WITH just hours to go until voting comes to a close for the Inspirational Youth of the West awards, rest assured – there is still time to cast your vote.With over , online votes so far counted across  categories, our youth and their sterling work and endeavours will be honoured on Friday, November  at the Devenish Complex for the gala congratulatory evening hosted by Pamela Ballantine.

This is an important step forward to help restore a devolved government.These are positive developments but the people of Northern Ireland deserve a locally elected, accountable and devolved government. This is my absolute priority as Secretary of State and I appreciate fully how the current impasse is unacceptable.That is why on Thursday I wanted to bring the parties together before we publish the legislation next week. This was the first time in eight months that all of the parties were in the same room, since the last talks process failed in February.The meeting had a clear focus - to provide the opportunity to discuss the new legislation in person.It is a really important piece of legislation for the people of Northern Ireland, for it allows the time and space to establish a talks process without the need to call an election. It also ensures continued good governance and the delivery of public services.There were strong views shared following the meeting but I believe equally strongly that we must discuss these important matters.I was keen to hear the views of all the parties on a route back to a talks process, before deciding on the best way forward.I look forward to receiving their feedback on the suggestions shared during the meeting.Yesterdays coverage of Karen Bradleys meetings in BelfastThursday was never going to be about finding immediate solutions. I have been clear that we need to focus on rebuilding dialogue, trust and consensus, supported by a clear way forward.I understand the deep frustrations of the political parties, but even more so, I understand the frustration of the people of Northern Ireland.There is an obligation on all of us to work together and get back to local politicians making local decisions in the interests of the people who elect them.Northern Ireland has made huge progress in recent years but we can achieve even more with a devolved government that unlocks all the potential it has to offer.The people here have overcome many huge challenges over the years. I believe we can overcome the current impasse.But megaphone politics will not succeed. We need to be honest and open, but it is just as important to listen as well as talk.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

It took us about a week to show him how.After an initial assessment, each seal began their journey to rehabilitation receiving extensive medical care, to ensure infections were kept at bay and housed in hospital pen whilst learning how to eat fish.Once they reached about kg and could self-feed, they were moved to the outdoor pools where they learnt how to socialise with other seals.At this stage, all human contact was kept to a minimum to ensure a successful re-introduction to the sea.Two days before their release, the seals were discharged from the seal unit as they had successfully reached their target weight of over kg and were in good health, ready to take on adult le in the wild.Ms Robinson said that Knockinelder Cove provides a great area for the pupsrsquo first few hours to get used to having no walls as they swim.ldquoWe never release a seal on its own and through our weekly weigh-in, we can identy release lsquoteamsrsquo such as Loki, Freya and Juno being our first for this season, she added.Ahead of the release all seals are tagged on their rear flipper to help identy them.Over time this will be used to see how rehabbed seals influence the wild population through breeding.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Anything that screws up their trade is a problem for them.“There are some specic issues, the supply chains in Ireland, for example, go across the Irish frontier – you’ve got whiskey going one way and cream going the other to make Baileys.“If the Irish border is a problem then they have a serious problem as a company.” You can envisage a situation in which Guinness and Baileys, which are the two brands which are the most affected, are seriously disrupted.“In an extreme scenario, where there is no deal or a very bad deal, you could see these favourite products drying up.”He said there is widening cross-political backing for a so-called People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, which his party is campaigning for.A Diageo spokesman said: “We’ve made it clear that a frictionless border in Ireland is the best outcome for every business large and small.

Inside the bell are the remains of an iron ‘clapper’ which struck the side to make the bell sound, but as it has corroded the bell is now silent. The new display has been made possible through a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has also enabled a community engagement programme around the item of shared heritage to take place.Dr Greer Ramsey, curator of archaeology at National Museums NI, explained the bell’s signicance, saying: “Along with religious books and the hooked staff or crozier carried by a bishop, bells became potent symbols of the Christian faith and even feature on stone carvings from this period.“Many hand bells were reputed to have connections to early saints so it was common for people to believe bells like this had miraculous powers.”To mark the recent discovery and display of the Ballyclog bell, there will be a special event at the Ulster Museum on November .Entitled, ‘Early Christian Ireland: Hand Bells, High Crosses, Music and More’, a series of talks will look at le in early Christian Ireland, at the use of church hand bells and at the identity of a mysterious musical instrument.

support fellow veterans has already exceeded his fundraising target.Lance Corporal Bryan Phillips, , who lost both of his legs above the knee after standing on an improvised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan in , aimed to lay  wreaths at  war memorials across Northern Ireland by Armistice Day as part of his ‘Poppy ’ fundraiser.He began the task in March this year.Speaking to the News Letter yesterday the Carrickfergus resident, who served in the Irish Guards for  years, said: “We have reached our target of  wreaths and  dferent war memorials to mark  years of the end of WW.“With the cost of £ to sponsor a wreath, the aim was to raise £, minimum for the Irish Guards Benevolent Fund and the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal.“The total amount raised to date is unknown and I don’t want to reveal it until a full count has been done, but we have exceeded our aim of £,.“The fundraising was harder than I thought, with a lot of mileage put in travelling all over the country making sure the sponsors have their wreaths on time for them to lay at their respective war memorials.“We are just chasing up the last few to give them out.“We have some wreaths that have been sponsored but the people would preferwe laid them on their behalf, so we will be covering the memorials that haven’t been sponsored using those wreaths.”One of the  organisations that have backed Bryan’s fundraising initiative is West Belfast Orange Hall, whose members will lay a wreath at the  Blitz Memorial in Shankill Graveyard on Remembrance Sunday.William Humphrey MLA, chairman of West Belfast Orange Hall management committee, praised Bryan’s fundraising efforts, describing him as “a truly inspirational inidual”.“West Belfast Orange Hall management committee was only too willing to support this fundraising effort by Bryan Phillips.“He is a truly inspirational inidual and has been selfless in raising funds for armed forces charities, including through this special initiative,” he said.Omagh victim ‘sickened’ by Sinn Fein lobbying against extradition of bomber Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

Allows @theresa_may to say the latter will never be needed.”He also said that: “Dublin now believes following news conference with [David] Lidington  Karen Bradley UK now more accepting of the [Joint Report]of last December ‘in full’.”What this would all appear to mean is that the UK is pressing ahead with the Irish border backstop. Now it is all a bit complicated . But nothing I have read has persuaded me that London is other than, at core, prepared to agree that Northern Ireland will always be entirely or largely in the European Union customs and regulatory space.The only remotely good news from a unionist point of view is thatthe UK is trying insofar as possible to keep Northern Ireland in the same customs arrangement as the rest of the UK.In other words, there will be no tarf barrier between the Province and Great Britain. This shows a level of determination to prevent an internal UK customs border, but there will be a regulatory one.The BBC reporter John Campbell grilled the Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on this point, during the latter’s visit to Northern Ireland yesterday, and he declined to be specic on whether there might be a regulatory border .Those who defend a backstop say that it only kicks inthere is no other UK-EU deal that prevents a hard Irish land border, but that misses the point because Dublin and the EU will clearly only accept a deal that has the effect of keeping in Northern Ireland in the EU customs and regulatory zone. There are some consolations in the shorter, darker days Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"What all this seems to confirm is that the UK will always be spineless in the face of anger from nationalist Ireland. London isdetermined to give greater assurance to a neighbouring jurisdictionthan it is to its own territory, even under a party that prides itself as Conservative and Unionist.Some experts say that a regulatory border doesn’t matter because the regulatory ergence between the UK and the EU will be minimal to non existent in any event but again, that is not the point.It is the UK declaration of intent that matters, because it has crumbled in the face of Dublin’s unwavering firm line. It also means that Brexit has signicantly weakened Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, evenit might be decades before the full implications of that become evident.But Arlene Foster was reported this week as sounding optimistic on an EU deal, saying: “Goodness, we have been here on a number of occasions and I think we are close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland, that is what we want.”With all these ious reports and contrasting signals, late last evening I phoned DUP numbers that I have and got Sammy Wilson MP, just before this paper went to press. This is some hours after he spoke to our reporter Stephen Gamble see page . He said that he had not been at the meeting with Mr Raab but the party did not have the detail on what is being proposed. If it was a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, the deal with the Tories would be over he said. Also, the prime minister would lose a raft of Brexiter Tory MPs and some Scottish Tories too.“She won’t get it through,” he told me. “It isas simple as that.” • Ben Lowry @BenLowry is News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: There are some consolations in the shorter, darker days• Ben Lowry: Unionism can’t afford to bury the talent it hasJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8692452.1541212904!/image/image.jpg","title":"unionism is hardly bursting with talent and cannot afford to bury that which it has  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Unionism is hardly bursting with talent and cannot afford to bury that which it hasJeff Dudgeon in the Belfast office of the News Letter, next to City Hall, where he serves as an Ulster Unionist councillor.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"donegall house on sale for m","story":"Posted on Thursday November  by Ulster Business A prominent Belfast building has gone on the market for offers over £.m, it can be revealed.Donegall House, which sits across from City Hall on Donegall Square, is now being marketed by Osborne King and CBRE.Built in , the building was refurbished in .
