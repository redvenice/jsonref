She was in her element – her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride’Her name is Joy and I photographed her outside one of the many African churches in south-east London. I had just finished photographing a mosque on the same bland industrial estate when I found the blue wall, then spotted Joy dancing in the church with her children. I thought: “That’s a portrait I’ve got to get,” and asked if she’d come outside and have her photograph taken.Her dress speaks to her sense of cultural pride. She’s in her element, in church, in a place where she can showcase her Nigerian clothes. When you put that across in the isive time in which we’re living, it paints a positive story about her identity as a Londoner, especially when you consider the wider context. Six countries in Europe have banned the burqa (16 worldwide) and Quebec has banned all religious symbols, but London has created spaces for people to celebrate their cultural heritage, and that’s special.Joy’s church is Christ’s Chosen Church of God. It’s one of several black-majority churches in streets where old warehouses are being used for Sunday worship. The services contrast with the mundane exteriors: worshipping God among the Nigerian community is a very celebratory experience. Outfits such as Joy’s are commonplace, and a good amount of the service is spent dancing and singing. I think that’s why so few people I approached for this project said no to being photographed – they are happy to do it when they feel good about themselves.I photographed Joy in August 2019, towards the end of a three-year project I called Sunday Best, which celebrates London’s religious ersity through portraits and stories of Londoners dressed for worship. My first idea was to photograph African churches in my area of south London, because the black teens in their Sunday best look so different from the negative stereotypes about hoodie culture. The project was shaped and expanded by events that unfolded thereafter.In June 2016, there was the Brexit vote, then the terrorist attacks in London in June 2017, which came just after I had a baby. I started to feel very pessimistic about bringing a child up in Britain, but after the Grenfell Tower fire I read all these tweets from people from other countries saying how much they admired the way the British – of all religions and races – pulled together in times of crisis. The lens through which other countries saw us seemed much more empathetic than how we view ourselves, and that made me want to reinforce a more positive vision of what it means to British.I chose to look at multiculturalism through religion because it’s so attached to national and cultural identity, and I sought out places of worship that served particular communities rather than particular denominations. The response I got came as a surprise, people saying: “We are British, and part of being British is being able to celebrate who we are. You don’t get this anywhere else in the world.” Such experiences built a celebratory and optimistic foundation for the project, amid a sombre national mood.As I went into the various places of worship, I became very aware of my own cultural misconceptions. I’m not religious, and I think that people like me sometimes think of religion in terms of ill-informed assumptions and problems. Take Islam. There are very narrow representations of Muslims in the media, but it’s a religion of 1.8 billion people. It can’t be represented by a few stereotypes. There’s a culture of fear based on a simple lack of understanding and knowledge that then breeds separatism and mistrust. But what religion brings to people’s lives in terms of a sense of belonging, companionship and community far outweighs the negatives. The religious people I spoke with talked about prayer and how much it helps with mental health.The religious ersity of London – and other cities such as Leicester, Manchester or Birmingham – should be celebrated. There are many different ways of telling stories of Britishness, but it’s the isive ones that are predominating at the moment. Instead of submitting to negative depictions, I want to use photography to show the best of who we are. • Sunday Best by Katie Waggett is published by Hoxton Mini Press.Training: BA graphic arts and design at Leeds politan University, and MA photojournalism and documentary photography at London College of Communication.Influences: Diane Arbus, Liz Hingley, Vanessa Winship, and my mother, Jackie Waggett, who was a painter and printmaker.High point: ‘Every time I come back with a portrait I’m proud of.’Low point: ‘Someone I adored died last year, and the way I found out destroyed me. I threw myself into photography, which became a kind of therapy for me. I try to hold on to the idea that a low point can also be creative.’Top tip: ‘If you want to photograph a stranger, smile as you approach. That sense of trust needs to be there from the start. It’s so simple, but many people who try to do what I do get turned down because they forget.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b626295d7d85d29d223ca05c4b7b1dc1aa23f752/10_0_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f3dc29173c2d03b01a6d35a6d4c8d5","title":"home safe home artist messages limited edition posters in pictures","story":"Need some encouragement to stay indoors?

Now we all want nothing moreWhen is living in a bubble a good thing? Why, when it’s a “support bubble”, or – since it lifted the prior ban on people from different households having sex – a shagbubble. There has also been talk of “social bubbles”, but what is behind all the froth?The word “bubble” is onomatopoeic, imitating the sound of bubbling liquid. (William Caxton, in his translation of a medieval French encyclopedia, describes the existence of wells that “spryng up with grete bobles” if you play a harp over them.)\u0026nbspMetaphorically, though, bubbles have historically not been good.

He said demand for DIY goods had surged while families had been stuck at home but admitted trade may slow as the economic downturn hits jobs. “These are temporary roles across the summer but we will continue to watch what happens,” he said.Online sales in the UK, not including food, rose by a third in May, according to the digital retail body IMRG, after a rise of nearly a quarter in April.

Andy Mulcahy, strategy and insight director at IMRG, said retailers had been coping with a surge in demand similar to the peak trading periods of Christmas and Black Friday but with a skeleton staff – partly because of the need for physical distancing in warehouses. He said the drop in demand for clothing and footwear – usually a very significant part of the non-food market – had meant some resources could be erted to manage demand from other sectors.

We have already taken a wide range of action in order to protect consumers and by making the ban permanent we aim to prevent people investing in complex, high risk products which are often designed to be hard to understand.Since we introduced the marketing ban we have seen evidence that firms are promoting other types of bonds which are not regularly traded to retail investors. We are very concerned about this and so we have proposed extending the scope of the ban.”The term mini-bond refers to a range of investments. The ban will apply to the most complex and opaque arrangements where the funds raised are used to lend to a third party, or to buy or acquire investments, or to buy or fund the construction of property. There are various exemptions including for listed bonds which are regularly traded, companies which raise funds for their own commercial or industrial activities, and products which fund a single UK income-generating property investment.The FCA ban means that products caught by the rules can only be promoted to investors who are “sophisticated or high net worth”. Marketing material will also have to include a specific risk warning and disclose any costs or payments to third parties that are deducted from the money raised from investors.In case you missed this yesterday, Londoners can look forward to more al fresco dining soon – and pretend they are on holiday in the Med. A swathe of central London is to be transformed into a huge continental-style outdoor dining area under plans to keep bars and restaurants in business.Westminister council is lining up 50 projects to make space for al-fresco dining including pavement widening and temporary road closures for part of the day in popular districts such as Chinatown, Covent Garden, Soho and Mayfair. Some small streets near Oxford Circus could also be closed for part of the day to accommodate tables.Hopefully this will also happen in other cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham, where the authorities are working on plans to pedestrianise streets or widen pavements to allow more space for outdoor tables.Overnight, two major British firms pledged to make payments to organisations representing black people and those of other minority ethnic backgrounds, after records emerged of their founders’ roles in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lloyd’s, the world’s oldest and biggest insurance market, and Greene King, the pub and brewery company both revealed that they would be making the reparations, without disclosing the sums involved. The news was first reported by the .Records archived by researchers at University College London (UCL) show that one of Greene King’s founders, Benjamin Greene, held at least 231 human beings in slavery and became an enthusiastic supporter of the practice.Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive officer, said on Wednesday night:It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s.The UCL records also show that Simon Fraser, a founder subscriber member of Lloyd’s, held at least 162 people in slavery and was paid the equivalent of nearly £400,000 at today’s rate for ceding a plantation in Dominica, while yet more were held at a site in British Guiana researchers believe either belonged to him or to his son.Lloyd’s apologised in a lengthy statement. A spokesman said:Lloyd’s has a long and rich history dating back over 330 years, but there are some aspects of our history that we are not proud of. In particular, we are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd’s market in the eighteenth and nineteenth century slave trade.

There has been a jump in new infections in several US states as lockdowns are eased. Beijing has seen the biggest resurgence in the disease since early February and has reinstated travel bans and school closures, as well as cancelling dozens of flights.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: With plummeting inflation, rising unemployment and lingering risks of a no-deal Brexit, the bank has room and solid reasons to move towards a more unorthodox policy. While the BoE’s near zero rates and massive asset purchases should push the consumer prices higher in the long run, inflation will probably not be a cause for concern in the foreseeable future.Given the expectation of quantitative easing expansion is fully priced in, the BoE announcement per se may not move the market significantly unless we see a meaningfully different outcome from the BoE meeting or a hint for more policy easing in the foreseeable future.When Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve, testified before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday, he reiterated that the Fed was ready to act if more support was needed for the economy.

I keep getting stopped in the street by people assuming I share their joy. I pull happy faces for them, but I mainly feel dread. Emotionally, I have long had far too much riding on my team lockdown afforded some blessed relief. As of this Saturday, I get back to my old, enervating normal: if West Brom lose I am far too unhappy, and if we win I go too far the other way.A while ago I saw a hypnotherapist for some guidance on how to get back to sleep when I woke up in the middle of the night. I was experiencing everything from general disquiet to wide-eyed terror. He suggested imagining myself in my happiest place. For many this was a beach, he suggested. Not for me it wasn’t. My happy place was the footpath next to a railway line in Smethwick that I would be walking along after we had won. To put myself there is truly to be swathed in serenity, and sleep soon comes. But if it doesn’t come quickly enough, everything backfires and the whites of my eyes gleam with fear anew. Because in my happy mental place, as in the real thing, I know that football joy is only a precursor to some fresh hell sooner rather than later. By the time I have walked back to the car, the joy of the victory is already being overwhelmed by concern about the next match. And so it goes on.Fifteen years ago I wrote a book that attempted to analyse what goes on in football fans’ heads. My cohort for this study was made up of fellow West Brom supporters. I spoke to fans who had not missed a game in decades, fans who had not missed a game in decades but then abruptly stopped going, and some who didn’t go to their first game until they were into middle age but then became as obsessed as any of us. I met one guy who travelled to every match but never watched the game because he was too nervous. He sat in the pub instead. And there was a teenage girl who had been going all her life and had never seen us concede a goal. This she had achieved by burying her head under her dad’s arm whenever the opposition looked likely to score. I took a consultant psychiatrist to a match to meet some of these people. Her conclusion was that ultimately they all seemed better psychologically equipped to deal with their football feelings than I was.For the few of you still reading even though you’re not into football, I should explain that with professional games for the top two isions resuming in England and Wales, my team are, along with Leeds United, hot favourites for promotion to the Premier League. I would be dreading this weekend much less if we weren’t. It’s ours to throw away – which, naturally, is what I inevitably, viscerally, unquestionably expect us to do. The fear is very real it’s on the attack, sweeping its way through my ill-marshalled emotional defences.I’m like this at the start of every season, but this is even worse. There’s not a whole nine months of ebb and flow ahead of us. With but nine games to play there will be scant opportunity to put right the damage of a poor start. It’s like watching England drawing in a World Cup semi-final at the end of extra time – but then having to wait three months for the penalty shootout.Also, in normal times, much of my anxiety would be related to working out how I could organise myself and, selfishly, my loved ones, around the practicalities of me disappearing to get to games. Now, with supporters not allowed in grounds, there’s not even this distraction.

I never expected a responseMy phone was buzzing off the hook. Congratulations were in order. As a single mum in lockdown with her two young boys, I had supposedly helped influence the government policy on support bubbles. How could that be, when I hadn’t even found the time to clean my bathroom?Two weeks earlier, enraged by the Cummings saga that was iding the nation, I took matters into my own hands. Bundling my youngest into his bike seat and placing my six-year-old on his bike, we cycled to the home of Britain’s most wanted man.As we neared the crowd outside the townhouse, I felt nervous. Holding my youngest on my hip and pulling my eldest in close, I strode through the parting reporters. “I’m just here to post a letter,” I stated to the policeman guarding their home. “I can take that for you,” he replied as I relinquished my handwritten letter addressed to Mr and Mrs Cummings. My greatest hope, as I watched him disappear round the side of their house, was that Dominic Cummings would take a moment to read my letter before – I assumed – throwing it in the bin.When lockdown was introduced in the UK, on 23 March, many single parents lost their support networks at one fell swoop. Trying to balance working, with home schooling, caring for a little one and maintaining a home was impossible. Have you ever wondered what it does to a human to have no meaningful adult contact for weeks on end, or recourse to a hug, while caring for children 247? In my letter, I explained how, prior to lockdown, my two young boys and I all went down with suspected Covid-19. I described this time as “unbearable”. “There wasn’t one day where I didn’t cry from the pressures, the exhaustion and the worries I was under.” Relatives and friends dropped off food and sent packages, for which I’m eternally grateful, but it didn’t remove the loneliness.As the days became weeks, this turned into complete isolation. Even phone calls with friends seemed impossible with a little one who followed me around like a tail. Over the weeks my sense of failure as a mother deepened as I cried too much and angered too quickly. By the time lockdown began to ease I’d fallen into a hole that was all-consuming I’m still struggling to emerge now.Two days after my impassioned letter was delivered, an email appeared in my inbox. It took me a few moments to work out who it was from. “Thanks so very much for your moving and powerful letter and for dropping it round,” Mary Wakefield began. The letter I’d feared would be discarded hadn’t just been read it had made an impression.Mary went on to say that the letter had helped her and Dominic understand the predicament of single mothers. He was keen to connect and see what the government could do for isolated single parents. Less than two weeks later I was speaking with a policy adviser at No 10 advocating for social bubbles, priority shopping and greater support for single parents. Two days after the phone call, support bubbles for single parents were announced by the prime minister at the daily press conference.Could they really never have considered single parents before? For me, having been writing about single motherhood for years, the answer is a resounding yes. People don’t often understand our lives, and many aren’t interested in trying to. In normal times the experience of the single mum includes being passed over for promotion, discriminated against in child benefit rules, and judged as a bad parent for not meeting the standards of a family with twice the resources. It’s well known that the prime minister is more famous for berating single mums than supporting them.I’m under no illusion that my letter was the only factor in this policy change. Support bubbles weren’t a new idea – New Zealand introduced them first, and many single parents in the UK lobbied for them. But, sometimes, a personal story can cut through the stats and facts to provide a picture of real life. Whatever the motive behind the shift in policy, single parents have finally been identified as a group with specific needs in this pandemic.Time will tell whether this is a one-off, or whether single parents are being given the recognition and rights we deserve to enable us to navigate life on a more equal footing. This isn’t the end of my campaigning journey. Single parents need practical, emotional and financial support during and after lockdown. To ensure this happens, single parenthood should be a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 and afforded the same rights as married coupledom. Only then will policymakers consider us as anything more than an afterthought, and only then will our experiences of discrimination be treated as such in law.• Ella Davis writes a blog on the trials and tribulations of life in London as a single mother to two young boys"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/369c6b2c3c04d7422383f5feac89c9ef3b917f3e/0_437_3846_2307/master/3846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d648f6870c97981154b8be96dac9b9c","title":"lying history britain statues slave trade","story":"Protesters may be toppling statues, but millions of records about the end of empire and the slave trade were destroyed by the stateBut lying about our history – and particularly about our late-colonial history – has been a habit of the British state for decades.In 2013 I discovered that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been unlawfully concealing 1.2m historical files at a highly secure government compound at Hanslope Park, north of London.Those files contained millions upon millions of pages of records stretching back to 1662, ning the slave trade, the Boer wars, two world wars, the cold war and the UK’s entry into the European Common Market. More than 20,000 files concerned the withdrawal from empire.There were so many of them that they took up 15 miles of floor-to-ceiling shelving at a specially built repository that a Foreign Office minister had opened in a private ceremony in 1992. Their retention was in breach of the Public Records Acts, and they had effectively been held beyond the reach of the Freedom of Information Act.The FCO was not alone: at two warehouses in the English midlands, the UK’s Ministry of Defence was at the same time unlawfully hoarding 66,000 historical files, including many about the conflict in Northern Ireland.When the files concerned with the withdrawal from empire began to be transferred to the UK’s National Archives – where they should have been for years, and where historians and members of the public could finally examine them – it became clear that enormous amounts of documentation had been destroyed during the process of decolonisation.Helpfully perhaps, colonial officials had completed “destruction certificates”, in which they declared that they had disposed of sensitive papers, and many of these certificates had survived within the secret archive.Beginning in India in 1947, government officials had incinerated material that would in any way embarrass Her Majesty’s government, her armed forces, or her colonial civil servants. At the end of that year, an Observer correspondent noted large palls of smoke appearing over government offices in Jerusalem.As decolonisation gathered pace, British officials developed a series of parallel file registries in the colonies: one that was to be handed over to post-independence governments, and one that contained papers that were to be steadily destroyed or flown back to London.As a consequence, newly independent governments found themselves attempting to administer their territories on the basis of an incomplete record of what had happened before.In Uganda in March 1961, colonial officials gave this process a new name: Operation Legacy. Before long the term spread to neighbouring colonies, where only “British subjects of European descent” were to be involved in the weeding and destruction of documents, a process that was overseen by police special branch officers. A new security classification, the “W” or “Watch series”, was introduced, and sensitive papers were stamped with a red letter W.Subsequently, there was the “Guard series” of papers stamped with a letter “G”. These could be shared with officials from Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand, but whenever this happened “the information should be accompanied by an oral warning that it must not be communicated to the Americans”. The Americans, it seems to have been assumed, were likely to be less forgiving of the sins of empire.In May that year the colonial secretary, Iain Macleod, issued instructions that the documents to be destroyed or smuggled back to London should include anything that might embarrass HMG embarrass her military, police or public servants that might compromise sources of intelligence or which could be used “unethically” by post-independence governments.By “unethically”, Macleod appears to mean that he did not wish to see the governments of newly independent nations expose, or threaten to expose, some of the more challenging aspects of the end of empire. There was certainly plenty to hide: the torture and murder of rebels in Kenya the brutal suppression of insurgencies in Cyprus and later Aden massacres in Malaya the toppling of a democratically elected government in British Guiana.Instructions were also issued on the means by which papers should be destroyed: when they were burned, “the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up”. In Kenya, officials were informed that “it is permissible, as an alternative to destruction by fire, for documents to packed in weighed crates and dumped in very deep and current-free waters at maximum practicable distance from the coast”.Operation Legacy was, as one colonial official admitted, “an orgy of destruction”, and it was carried out across the globe between the late 1940s and the early 70s.The operation – and its attempts to conceal and manipulate history in an attempt to sculpt an official narrative – speaks of a certain jitteriness on the part of the British state, as if it feared that interpretations of the past that were based upon its own records would find it difficult to celebrate the “greatness” of British history.It seems likely that uncertainty about the imperial mission also played a part in the commissioning of Colston’s statue. It was erected in 1895, a full 174 years after his death, at a time when the British were anxious about their rapidly expanded empire. The first Boer war had ended badly for them, exposing the physical weakness of soldiers recruited from urban slums the United States was emerging as an industrial force and Germany appeared to be challenging the Royal Navy’s maritime dominance.The answer, it seems, was the erection of statues, up and down the United Kingdom, of early “heroes” of empire – even slave traders – as an inspiring example to the adventurers and imperialists to come.Now that’s an act of act of historical revisionism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6915ff5a0565911f41294726e3405141ba2b642/0_238_768_461/master/768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68521fe38fd01b60c3e7c4d777aa9efd","title":"youre never too old to climb a tree and i should know","story":"As a boy, I was too terrified to tackle the beautiful horse chestnut near my home. But I’ve changed a lot in four decadesOne day, when I was around 10 years old, I was to be found clinging to a branch of a conker tree. Being scared of heights, I was terrified. I was about six feet off the ground. Dan, an older kid who I idolised somewhat, was looking at me. “You’re going to struggle when you’re older,” he said, “’cos you might grow that tall.” A fair point. Above us, a distant figure flitted about in the highest reaches of the tree. This was my fearless younger brother, showing me how it was done. Humiliating, really.That horse chestnut tree still stands behind my parents’ house. The other day this memory came back to me as I took in its beauty. I climbed over their garden fence, and through 10 metres of thick nettles and stuff, to stand in the damp, clear space beneath the tree’s canopy. The branch I had clung to didn’t seem to have changed in the 40 years since. I rested my head against it to confirm I had indeed grown as tall as Dan had predicted.Before I knew it, I had somehow swung my way up and edged along the thickening branch to the trunk of the tree. Everything was slippy after some rain this was idiotic. I was now at twice my height but pressed on. Halfway up, bang in the middle of the whole magnificent edifice, I stopped, looked down, and felt a bit sick. I clung on a bit tighter, surely leaving my fingerprints in the trunk, and wondered what to do.That decision was soon taken out of my hands as a clap of thunder crashed overhead. I slid and fell and grappled my way to the ground. I felt a bit foolish, but what of it?

Many have not accessed any remote learning throughout lockdown.The multi-million-pound programme, to be funded by government, is expected to involve thousands of tutors and will be delivered in schools, with a mixture of online and face-to-face sessions, designed to support and complement pupils’ regular school work.The catch-up lessons will be available to pupils from all year groups in both primary and secondary and can be accessed by all schools, but will be targeted particularly at those serving disadvantaged communities where learning loss is likely to be greatest.The detail of the comprehensive tuition scheme is being finalised ready to be announced later this week, as the government tries to head off scathing criticism of its handling of children’s education during the pandemic.One study last week found that around 2 million children in the UK have done little or no schoolwork throughout.Union leaders reacted cautiously to the proposals, saying ministers couldn’t just present ideas that “simply sound good”, and raised concerns about whether it was possible to scale up the provision of private tutoring.Boris Johnson, under pressure during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, told MPs his education secretary Gavin Williamson would announce a “big catch-up plan” for pupils very shortly. “It’s vital that kids get the catch-up on the education they have lost,” he said.The government is encouraging secondary schools to bring in pupils for a one-off face-to-face review meeting before the end of term to find out what progress the student has made and what additional support might be required going into the next academic year.Some academy trusts are also looking at bringing in pupils a week early before the start of the autumn term to enable teachers to identify learning gaps and start preparing students for the rigours of academic study after a long gap.Hamid Patel, the chief executive of Star Academies trust that operates 29 state schools in England, said his group planned to help those most affected by the prolonged absence, including disadvantaged pupils and the year groups at significant transition points or facing exams next year.“Our strategy to bridge widening gaps, foster resilience and set our pupils up for success is built on planned interventions over a 12-month period. We intend to use a set of measures including summer holiday camp, Saturday school and planned literacy and numeracy catch-up sessions within the school timetable.”The government’s tuition programme is expected to be available from September and will form one of the main strands in the government’s education catch-up offer. “The overall catch-up package is quite significant,” said one source close to the project. “It will be long-term, at least a year. All schools will be able to access it, but it will be targeted at those with high numbers of disadvantaged pupils.”Summer holiday schemes are more likely to focus on sports, arts and citizenship – rather than academic work – with the aim of supporting pupils’ mental health and physical wellbeing after being locked down at home throughout the pandemic.The Sutton Trust, Education Endowment Foundation, Nesta and Impetus, who earlier this month jointly launched a new online tuition pilot to support disadvantaged pupils as schools began to open to more pupils, are expected to be involved in developing the catch-up tutoring programme.Launching the pilot, they quoted evidence supporting the use of one-to-one and small-group tuition as a cost-effective way to help pupils who are struggling regular sessions of 30 minutes, three to five times a week over six to 12 weeks, to achieve the best results, adding five additional months’ progress.One of the four models being piloted involved the Tutor Trust – a not-for-profit charity which recruits and trains university students and recent graduates as tutors in the core subjects of maths, English and science – who provide one-to-one tuition in state schools. The charity’s co-founder and chief executive, Nick Bent, said: “We want to play our part in this national effort to help disadvantaged pupils catch up.”Leora Cruddas, the chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said it was vital that the government’s catch-up programme should be a long-term endeavour, rather than just a summer holiday scheme. “Where tuition can have value is where it’s done alongside the curriculum. If the government is going to be spending money, I would suggest that those programmes start in the autumn and are strongly aligned with the work a school is doing.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “With so much legitimate concern about the growing gap between advantaged and disadvantaged young people, it’s essential that any plans to address the issue are based in evidence of what works rather than what may simply sound good.“The starting-point should be a review by the child’s teacher of where the child is now, and what their curriculum needs to look like. Schools should then be able to direct any additional resources, such as 1:1 after-school tuition, small group work, textbooks, to turbo-charge pupils’ learning.”Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We’ve got nothing against extra support for literacy and numeracy. The question with all these things is, if you are using private providers, how easy is it to scale up.”Meanwhile, more than 1,500 of the UK’s leading paediatricians and child health specialists have told Boris Johnson he needs to urgently publish the government’s plans for children to return to school, in an unprecedented warning that their absence “risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people”.The letter circulated by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) – the first time it has asked its members to sign a joint message to the prime minister – quickly attracted hundreds of signatures in support of its blunt message: “Left unchecked, Covid-19 will exacerbate existing problems and deepen structural social and health inequalities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c459c3ed7d0fcf3f365dd192ed56ec613fa525/1_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f25f97aef5ddbe2c07b383ee4654a07f","title":"my lockdown spring watch a photo essay","story":" sports photographer  Tom Jenkins follows up his popular take on tulips during the enforced break from action photography. Here he talks about how photographing a pair of long-tailed tits nesting in his front garden helped him through a difficult spring“Bum barrels twit on bush and treeScarse bigger then a bumble beeAnd in a white thorn’s leafy restIt builds its curious pudding-nestWi hole beside as if a mouseHad built the little barrel house.”Recently, I was told that I was showing classic signs of “biophilia” – I had to open a dictionary to learn this meant enjoying “the love of life or living systems” and displaying the psychological condition of being attracted to all that is alive and vital. I had just published a picture essay about some tulips that were flourishing in my back garden. I was nervous submitting it – here was a sports photographer, denied his usual fare because of the pandemic, trying his hand at something very different. I was pleasantly surprised by the response, with far more people getting in touch than I’ve ever had for a sports story.\u0026nbspThe tulips died down, but sport was nowhere near a return. I needed something else and, fortunately, nature handed me another gift, a project that would test my photographic skills and give me the adrenaline buzz that I desperately missed from my normal job.Just as lockdown had fully kicked in around my north London home, I couldn’t help but notice two tiny birds flitting around my front garden. I was a complete bird novice. I knew robins, mainly because of Christmas cards, and other birds because they were nicknames of football teams – magpies, eagles, seagulls, canaries, etc. Every year I go with my family to the wildlife photography exhibition at the Natural History Museum and marvel at the pictures, amazed by the skill, technique and patience needed to create such beautiful images. Did it make me want to do similar? Not really, sport was my thing and I was happy with that.But these little birds kept grabbing my attention. We soon realised a nest was being built in the rose bush growing beside our front door. I had no idea what these birds were called, needing an uncle to identify them as long-tailed tits, Britain’s lightest bird and known as bum barrels. “You lucky things!” he said. These two were near-identical cute fluffballs with mainly black and white plumage tinged with bits of grey and pink. Only later, under close inspection of the photos, did I realise one had an orange eyeball, the other had yellow. They went everywhere together I read that long-tailed tits often went round in large groups as an extended family but these two were by themselves. I decided I might as well follow them, seeing if I could get a decent frame or two. This was my chance to be a bird photographer, at least for a while.At first it was really frustrating – I would see them on a branch but before I could focus they were off. They were so quick and seemed nervous of me. As for getting them in mid-air, their undulating and erratic flight seemed impossible to capture. I needed another approach: rather than chasing them around, I realised I had to be in place first and let them come to me. I began to learn their patterns of behaviour, noting routes they flew and places they visited. It reminded me of an approach I use in sports photography, getting to know “the hot zones”, areas where most action happens and the chance of success is greater. With these birds it tended to be near the rose bush, as they would always return there for nest building.To improve my chances of a better picture, I researched the birds expanding my knowledge of them could help me work out what they were doing. As I learned more about the birds I got closer to them. I started to get some half-decent images but all were of them sitting neatly on a branch or bush. I needed something a little more exciting and challenging, to show their character. Luckily for me they decided to provide exactly what I needed.For about three weeks during their nest building they would have sudden mood changes. Most of the time, when perched, they looked calm and cute, but then, out of the blue, they would become aggressive. They began flying into my front windows, repeatedly hitting the glass. I’d never seen anything like this before and no other birds were doing it. I guessed they must have been confused by the reflections off the glass, attacking the mirror image of themselves, thinking it was a rival bird threatening their new nest. I know it might sound a little cruel but I found it fascinating – and not bad for pictures.This behaviour could happen at any time during the day. We could be watching television when there would be a tap, tap, tap on the window – the angry birds. Sitting in my armchair I’d have a perfect view of the TV and the front window. There could be someone having their arm ripped off on the show Tiger King but my gaze was fixed elsewhere.Some days were much quieter. I’d be sitting, poised with camera, waiting for the birds, but nothing. That didn’t seem too bad if I was inside but I would also sit outside, tucked away behind my bins in a basic attempt to disguise myself, getting some very strange looks from passersby, obviously questioning my mental wellbeing. The hours would pass, time enough for me to wonder myself about my own sanity, then suddenly there would be a flurry of action. It reminded me of being at a cricket match, waiting ages for something to happen, then boom, drama all over in a flash.The birds seemed to have their favourite spots. Stretching across the street are a couple of old telephone wires, which they loved sitting on and bouncing in between. It gave them a perfect view down to the nest below and no other bird used them. It was part playground, part lookout, part bathroom and all theirs. Frequently, as the last rays of the setting sun hit the wires, the birds would wash themselves and dry off there.Looking at the nest it was easy to see why the long-tailed tit has been called the structural engineer of the bird world. These two put together an amazing rugby-ball shaped construction with a small entrance hole about three-quarters of the way up. It was built from hair, moss, cobwebs and lichen but, most ingeniously of all, with silk from spider cocoons which made the nest elastic and stretchy, so when it was full of growing chicks it could expand with them. Once the outside was made the two birds set about finding a stash of feathers – up to 2,000 can be used – to line the inside, making it soft for the eggs to be laid.When the nest was done the constant flying ceased. I presumed the eggs were laid as one bird would often stay behind, probably incubating, while the other found food. We loved it when we could see the bird’s head poking out of the nest entrance, watching the world go by. This pattern continued for quite a few days until I sensed something else was happening. I saw one of the birds with food in its mouth heading into the rose bush – a sure sign. Perched on top of a ladder I found a great view, in between branches straight through to the nest entrance which had a large pigeon feather pulled across, shielding the contents inside. The parent completely ignored me and poked its head inside – a tiny beak appeared.From then on, growth for the chicks was rapid, fuelled by the endless food shuttles the parents were doing. Backwards and forwards they flew, laden with various insects and grubs. The chicks quickly lost their reptilian looks, gaining feathers and fluffing up. The distinctive white line of the long-tailed tit was on their heads, like they had tiny Mohican haircuts. It may be a stereotypical scene, seen countless times on television, thrusting beaks of egg-yolk yellow, eager to grab food from a parent, but it still gave me goosebumps witnessing it right there in front of me.The chicks would desperately try to force themselves forward to the very edge of the entrance hole, hoping to be first in line for grub. This jostling of positions would often end up in squabbling and bickering – it struck a familiar chord with me. In between the regular feeds they would sleep, some with necks hanging right out of the nest, not wanting to lose their hard-earned priority position.Unsure of exactly when the first chicks were born, I had to guess the day they might start leaving the nest. Fledging time was approaching. One day I looked out and saw the first chick had ventured from the nest and on to surrounding branches. After about 20 minutes of washing itself and wobbling around, very unsure on its feet, it decided that was enough and headed back inside the nest. The next day I went out very early. Looking down to the ground I saw two chicks had tumbled eight feet from the nest down to the concrete paving.One was already dead, the other looked battered, shaken and groggy – a heartbreaking sight. We scooped up the injured one in a tiny bowl and placed it back in the rose bush. It was ignored by both parents – the question was, did these two chicks fall or were they pushed? Perhaps the nest got overloaded and they were forced out? I also started to think about my role. Should I be trying to save this chick? Was I interfering with nature? It’s obviously a frequent dilemma faced by many recording the natural world. The injured and scorned one fell out of the rose bush another couple of times, and each time we scooped it up and placed it back. After the fourth fall we had to make the decision to leave it to die. I was gutted. Another chick emerged from the nest and briefly wobbled around. Whether or not it saw its sibling lying on the paving below I can’t be sure, but it soon decided freedom was overrated and returned inside.The next morning, while eating breakfast, I heard a commotion from the nest, one much louder than the usual arguments. Going out I couldn’t believe it – the sweetest chicks you could ever imagine emerging from the nest and perched in the branches of the rose bush, seven in total. A mass wash and unfurling of feathers was happening, the chattering noise incredible. Gradually they found their balance and bravery, wandering around before, one by one, they summoned up the courage to take their maiden flights, in this case around three feet over to the privet hedge. Some just about made it some fell short, landing on a dustbin, window box or dwarf Christmas tree. One landed on my camera. Somehow they all managed to meet up in the privet hedge, where they began to mimic being back in the nest, squeezing together in a bundle of fluff and feather.That first night out they went to sleep, seven in a row, packed tightly on a branch in the privet hedge. But the next morning, they had gone. I looked for ominous signs, like loose feathers, fearful that a cat or fox had found them. Thankfully there were none.They had flown off and my feeling of responsibility had gone with them. I stood in my back garden, all around me a cacophony of tweets and squeaks as new wings were being tested out, but not the ones I was really interested in. Occasionally I spotted one of the parent birds in among all the others, blackbirds, thrushes, wrens and wood pigeons … and robins of course. Later that evening I saw one of our chicks in a tree near our bathroom window, looking tiny, out by itself in the wide, open world. But after that sighting I saw them no more. They were definitely gone.It has been said that sport has often played a vital role at times of crisis, battles on the pitch taking the nation’s mind away from battles off it. This time, it’s clear to me that nature has stepped up to take on the role of the great distractor.

This would create jobs in supply chains, and help with those most affected by fuel poverty, he said: “So there’s a big social win there too.”For rewilding programmes, people could work on areas such as tree-planting and peat bog restoration.Other areas of the plan include a requirement for at least half of all Bank of England financing to go into green investment programmes, and a new system of government “climate bonds” to raise extra capital. People would also receive tax incentives on savings and pensions for investing in green areas.Labour has unveiled similarly ambitious plans, with the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, calling for the creation of a “zero-carbon army of young people” doing work such as planting trees, insulating buildings and working on green technologies.Miliband has likened the task to the rebuilding process undertaken by Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government, which involved the creation of the NHS."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52c22d79fa801b1371e7c19d545eeed7e34bbce6/0_290_4351_2611/master/4351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efeb2ba3d1e772bd3b0907660ff09a15","title":"scotland to ban mass culling of mountain hares","story":"Scottish parliament votes to give mountain hares special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside ActGamekeepers and grouse moor managers will be banned from mass culling mountain hares after Scottish ministers bowed to intense pressure from conservationists.The Scottish parliament voted on Wednesday night to give mountain hares special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, which will make it an offence to intentionally or recklessly kill or injure the hare without a licence.Conservationists and animal welfare groups were delighted with the decision, which came as MSPs voted to ban salmon farms from shooting seals and introduced far tougher penalties for wildlife crime amongst a swathe of new animal protection measures.Bob Elliot, director of the animal welfare charity OneKind, and a former wildlife crime investigator, said his organisation and others had been pressing Holyrood to protect mountain hares for several years.“Different reasons given by the grouse shooting industry for the supposed need to control mountain hares, such as the prevention of louping ill, a disease carried by ticks, have been successively discounted, and animal welfare has taken precedence,” he said.The measure was introduced by Alison Johnstone, the Scottish Green party MSP, as a late amendment to the animal protection bill and accepted on Wednesday night by Mairi Gougeon, the Scottish rural affairs minister.The mountain hare, which live in the Highlands and upland areas of southern Scotland and northern England, is widely seen as an emblematic species it turns white in winter to aid camouflage in the snow. Up to 25,000 are thought to be shot each year by grouse moor managers and gamekeepers on the grounds they carry ticks and diseases which harm young red grouse, and also feed on heather, shrubs and saplings.The joint nature conservation committee, an expert advisory committee to the UK government, told the EU last year that mountain hares were in “unfavourable inadequate conservation status”, partly due to a lack of data about their numbers.The Werrity report for the Scottish government, which recommended licensing of grouse moors last year, also said mountain hares required greater protection.Sarah-Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land \u0026amp Estates, which represents landowners, said: “These changes will not help Scotland’s wildlife, which is the prime concern of gamekeepers and land managers.“Mountain hares are thriving on Scotland’s moors and their fate will not be improved by this vote. There is clear evidence that the control of hares helps combat tick and Lyme disease and protect plants and young trees. Balanced wildlife management is key to meeting Scottish government targets on bioersity and tree planting.”Alex Hogg, chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, said: “A grave mistake has been made today. This is a bad law, made by people it will not impact upon.“There will be no satisfaction in turning around in a few years and saying: we told you so, but, certainly, this is an important date in the demise of another iconic species, killed by political trade-offs and emotive campaigns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29626a7d2225cc2ab24b972c6758ef4f0417ca19/0_96_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5e08a2ff26046dcd110713edd32224d9","title":"what its really like to be black in the fashion industry","story":"Models, casting agents and stylists tell us their experiences in the fashion and beauty worldsI grew up in Nottingham which is a hugely erse city. Everything I am comes back to home – I was blessed to go to a school with a majority BAME attendance and I was blessed to have friends who came from a range of erse backgrounds. We’d casually speak about our lives, teach one another our customs, talk about how our mums disciplined us, laugh at the differences – and it’s these exchanges and an interest in other people that inform my life and work today.Being constantly asked about “ersity” makes me feel like I’m always being typecast as someone who only casts people of colour, but at the forefront of my work is a meaning and message of constantly pushing for change. Whilst this is somewhat true, and ersity is always present in my world, I’m actually only really doing my job. I live in London, one of the most culturally erse cities in the world, it makes sense for me to represent the faces I see around me. It’s all just second nature.Ideally, we will get to a place where ersity isn’t such a buzzword and fair representation is a given, but for real change to happen, these interviews and questions need to be directed at the bigger institutions, publications and fashion houses.We need to be questioning ersity and inclusion across their boards, committees and within their recruitment processes. Let’s unpack the systemic oppression of people of colour and the hierarchal nepotism that leads to a lack of opportunities for people of colour. So I yield my time and put it to the fashion industry to not ask me what I am doing in my work, but to look within itself and ask what they are doing.Fashion has always been a wonder to me, by the age of 14 I would buy the new glossies every month and study the cover all the way through to the back of the book. So you could imagine my excitement when I got accepted to study fashion journalism at the London College of Fashion.However, at 18, I learned the hard lesson that fashion wasn’t necessarily ready for someone who looked like me. At university, I was one of a handful of black girls on my course and I was often made to feel othered. Now I have to add at this time the prejudices I faced landed on a social-economical side as opposed to racism. I wasn’t racially abused outright, but my use of colloquial language and my style – of a working-class black girl from a council estate in Oxford – was often sniggered at during lectures.After university, I interned and worked for free as many of my peers did. Soon I landed my first job at a national newspaper. My old classmates referred to me as the ‘token hire’. Often as a black person in this industry, you constantly have to prove your talents and worth. Unfortunately, I often feel like a token hire. This isn’t because I lack talent, it’s because of the lack of people that look like me when I step into these spaces. I am often the only black woman, and if I am not, then somewhere down the line, I will be mistaken for that only other black woman. I could relay to you horror stories about things I’ve faced in this industry. I’ve been asked if I wash my hair – people have touched my hair out of the middle of nowhere! Models I’ve selected have been called too dark. My style is constantly put into an urban category. I get typecaste for certain jobs and looked over for others. Editors have stolen my ideas of representing blackness and presented them as their own. The list goes on.However, we have gone past the time when I think black people need to relive their trauma in a way to educate. If you open your eyes, you can see that systematic racism is prevalent in fashion. I ask you to look at your teams, do they reflect how multicultural the outside world is? Do you support black designers? Do you cast more than one black model? Do you have any black senior members of staff? If you answer no to any of those questions, then now is finally the time to change. I’m hopeful for change, but I hope it comes soon. It’s exhausting working for an industry you love that doesn’t love you.Working in the industry, I realised that as a black woman, and a young black woman at that, it was harder for my work to be taken seriously because I was considered inexperienced, despite my wide range of clients and a multifaceted body of work, I would still find challenges to be heard. Marie Claire wrote of me in an article: “At 21, Mariélle already has a resumé – shoots for British Vogue, Fenty and Nike – that rivals those of industry veterans twice her age.”Reading this, I felt conflicted, whilst proud of my resumé, and the work I have achieved, what is not seen are the emotional difficulties that I have had to push through. From feeling like I don’t belong on certain jobs, to being the only black person in the crew, or being put in a box: ‘She can do black makeup so let’s get her.’ I know black creatives will know the experiences I speak of. We all know. I won’t dwell on these points. These are difficulties, however, that I continue to push through to continue doing what I love.What I want now is for real change to happen. No more performative black squares, I want real change from these big corporations who are heavily influenced by black culture. Existing cosmetic brands need to start catering to black skin and not wait until there’s an uproar because they’ve decided to create 20 shades of beige and two “medium-deep” shades. Black skin cannot be an afterthought any more. Include us in the process.I know I am not the only black model to have experienced agencies stating that they already had enough black girls on their books or the idea of not wanting many that ‘look the same’, resulting in a particular favouritism for models with the look of the moment. Being 3 of 12 selected for a runway with these dynamics in mind, makes it more difficult for a genuine shift. These factors attached to token gestures of inclusivity are features that stagnate any real change or space for growth in an industry capable of presenting an array of black faces, if it felt compelled to.Being stereotyped is something I have experienced in my career and on occasion, over the years, I have censored myself in certain situations out of fear of being perceived as the aggressor, the a or rude. Which is uncanny, as an action will cause a reaction. I was told that ‘I should shave all my hair off so I can look like the other black models’ which would ‘help my career’. At the time I couldn’t believe what I was being advised to do in order for me to succeed. I politely said I will never cut my hair because black girls look beautiful with or without hair. In order for me to get work, to survive, I found myself conforming to ‘fit in’ with industry standards. But as time moved on this acceptance became more tiring and uncomfortable. A lack of knowledge of black skin tones and black hair has meant that for me not to look ashy – or have my hair damaged – I have had to bring my own products to shoots, in order to not be seen as ‘difficult’ which hurts when other models can just turn up to the job, without having to exert any additional labour.The industry is slowly ersifying, however, there are structural issues that still need to be addressed, especially, if we are going to work in an environment that does not present constant micro aggressions. The need for more black managers, directors, editors-in-chief, creative directors and more, in permanent positions, offers a way to create a systemic impact.I have carried the weight of being one of the very few black women in an office throughout my career, conscious that my mannerisms, outfits and work could either positively or negatively influence another black person getting the same role – because why else are there very few like me here or even in senior positions? I had experienced situations in which I had been overlooked for permanent positions, shielded from duties that would enhance my skills and sometimes when it came to pay was offered less. It hurts, as not only did I feel that I’d worked hard, I had more experience. Often when I began to consider the details, the only real difference was the colour of my skin.However, I’d soon come to find a seat at the Matchesfashion table starting my journey in the company as a PR intern in 2015, supporting both the womenswear and menswear teams, looking after UK, Europe and international press. While my experience may not echo that of others who have worked at Matchesfashion I know the love and support I have received from my team is unique to the industry that we are in, not in a ‘we know you are black so feel we have to be nice to you’ way but one based on opportunities guided by meritocracy and genuine love and care. Importantly I feel like I have been listened to, my voice is always welcomed, and I’ve been given the opportunity to develop my ideas and plan events both local and international.I hope that my story shows that there are allies that will support you, and people who are willing to mentor and advise. I do hope that one day a young black person can see an industry where they are welcome, where their ideas are listened to, are employed and promoted not to fit a quota but because of their talent and experience. To know that ersity is more than just a headline.Racism in fashion is more passive, so a common experience I have is being the token black guy or a choice between me or five other guys that ‘look like me’ as designers don’t like to include ‘too many’ PoC in their projects. I’ve had an interesting experience as a black model working in the fashion industry. I like to look at the positives in things so the fact I can inspire others with the things I’ve done is something I appreciate.It has been challenging and it does test my patience in many ways, but it gives me the feeling of accomplishment when I do things that were pretty much impossible for black models not so long ago. Diversity is an important term in fashion and it is necessary. Models need to represent all backgrounds in these clothes they’re on the runway in as there isn’t just one type of customer who purchases these pieces.I just feel that sometimes designers use “ersity” for marketing as its due to be featured in press and that’s something I don’t support. I hope the fashion industry refreshes their mind on what ersity really means and start seeing people for people rather than what audience they might trigger or their closed-minded definition of beauty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420a04b19637231abffcbffb4bac4f30a2996935/301_475_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94ecbe5bc1a0e9c773b55dea04756036","title":"resistance review marcel marceau biopic jesse eisenberg","story":"Jesse Eisenberg plays the legendary performer who helped thousands of Jews escape the Nazis, in a well-meaning but cliche-ridden biopicA handsomely produced and well-meaning movie, but freighted with cliche, about the remarkable wartime career of mime legend Marcel Marceau in the French resistance. He helped thousands of Jewish children and adults escape Nazi-occupied France. It’s a very notable story but this is another of those sepia second world war films for which there continues to be a solid market.Preposterously, the action is supposed to be narrated in flashback by General Patton (a cameo for Ed Harris) as he addresses the serried ranks of the US troops who have just liberated France, telling them the story of one of that country’s most amazing civilian heroes – Marceau. (The troops are supposed to have remained standing for the entire length of the story.) Jesse Eisenberg plays Marceau, the young Chaplin superfan who uses his flair for comedy and mime to gladden the hearts of the Jewish orphans in France under his care before the Nazi invasion, the same children that he would have to save from the death camps. There’s plenty of resistance derring-do, and the film imagines a tense face-to-face encounter on a train between Marceau, posing as a choirmaster with his kids trained to sing Ave Maria to disguise their Jewish origin from the Nazis, and the notorious Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie, played with icy fanaticism by Matthias Schweighöfer. Eisenberg does an honest job with the role of Marceau, but it is a subdued performance. Marceau emerges as animatedly nerdy before the Nazis invade, but when the film has to show his heroism, Eisenberg plays him pretty straight. The result is a performance that could have been turned in by anyone.• Resistance is available on digital platforms from 19 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2fa8c5142d16f21278ef7fe8fbdc3e0b05e1992/5_0_1212_727/master/1212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af63f4eab0f58a84b6ae361507da2cb3","title":"the ground beneath my feet review marie kreutzer valerie pachner","story":"An executive’s important business trip is threatened by unnerving family news in an eerie, elegant psychological dramaThe creepy phone call that’s coming from inside the house – a well-known scary-movie trope. The threat is more disturbingly intimate than you thought, or more disturbingly metaphorical. It’s an idea touched on in this elegant and mysterious psychological drama from Austrian film-maker Marie Kreutzer. Her trajectory of fear is not angled as you might think, towards a supernatural revelation or a down-to-earth explanatory twist or even an enigmatically balanced ambiguity between the two. For much of the time, The Ground Beneath My Feet has the uncanny-realist feel of something like Olivier Assayas’s Personal Shopper or Michael Haneke’s Hidden with its moment-by-moment portrait of emotional breakdown in the face of an unexplained phenomenon, and there’s something of Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann in its study of family dysfunction. But it seems to me different from all these: the transgressive threat approaches and recedes like thunder, leaving us with a study in loneliness.The person beneath whose feet the ground is shifting and disappearing is Lola (Valerie Pachner), a young corporate executive whose habit is to answer her mobile curtly with her surname (“Wegenstein”) as if always expecting a business call, nothing personal. Lola lives on her own in Vienna, through whose avenues she goes running every morning. She is driven, focused, goal-oriented and excited by an imminent business trip to Rostock in Germany, where her consultancy firm is about to land a big commission. Lola is also looking forward to hotel-room assignations with her boss, Elise (Mavie Hörbiger), with whom she is having a passionate affair, made more dangerous by the fact that Elise is in a position to advance her career, or – perhaps – to impede it by capriciously advancing others on her team.Something could yet ruin all this sleek sexual and professional gratification. Lola’s elder sister, Conny (Pia Hierzegger), who has paranoid schizophrenia – like their late mother – attempts to take her own life and is taken to hospital. Lola must frantically deal with this situation without ever confessing to the other yuppies that she has this family problem, that she is human like everyone else. Then she gets phone calls, apparently from Conny in hospital, accusing Lola of abandoning her and saying the nurses are abusing her. But wait. Conny is not allowed phone calls. Who and where are these calls coming from?Lola’s new crisis takes this movie to some subtle yet sensational set pieces of fright. Trying to keep it all together as best she can, Lola visits her doctor and confesses that she herself might be experiencing hallucinations. The weary, concerned doctor asks her a series of questions, the most important being whether she has a family history of mental illness. Kreutzer has Lola give an evasive answer before cleverly keeping the camera on her for the crucial next few moments. What is she hearing now? Whose questions are these? Is this interview making things worse?Kreutzer is very good at evoking the strangely dull, bland, identikit spaces of the mid-price business hotel, in which Lola is in her element. The film finds something inviting in the lobbies, the corridors with their tactfully subdued lighting, the bars and the restaurants in which various business meetings with tacky subtexts have to be negotiated. As Elise says to her, half accusingly, half teasingly: “You love hotels”. And she does. Their very emptiness and impersonality are liberating, and they are, after all, where she can have the best sex. In a hotel, there is no reminder of home, or family, or any of the things that she finds painful.And so the Conny situation, in all its pain and confusion, unfolds alongside an ugly confrontation in the office that reveals to Lola a toxic sort of sexual politics. Her importance in the team making this crucial presentation in Rostock seems to fluctuate, and she may or may not be justified in her suspicion that opening up to Elise about Conny will be a catastrophic mistake that would make her look weak and unreliable. Yet nothing is entirely clear, including the wisdom of Lola’s growing conviction that she might be able to save Conny by bringing her home to live with her. When Lola gets into a lift, and gets one of her unearthly phone calls from Conny at the same moment that the lift breaks down between floors, it brings a shiver of fear, and also of sadness.• The Ground Beneath My Feet is available on digital platforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/937e48fd458fc0e53543d612cdacf319fe434ad7/0_158_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=530465b8af954bc7526838bd4650c3ba","title":"food live animal markets new york coronavirus","story":"Amid the coronavirus, calls have grown to ban the erse US markets that stock and slaughter live animals. But is that wise? John Harry was in the mood for chicken curry, so he walked two blocks from home to pick out a couple of birds.His destination was a squat warehouse surrounded by auto body shops, a scrapyard, and a school bus depot in the working-class neighborhood of Richmond Hill in Queens, New York. Inside was riotously loud, with the cries of chickens, duck, quail, guinea fowl and the tender pigeons known as squab, jostling for space and pecking seed in tall metal cages. In another room was a pen with lambs and goats butting heads and chewing alfalfa.The warehouse smelled powerfully of feathers and droppings, but Harry, a Guyanese construction worker in his 50s, seemed unfazed. He pointed out two broiler hens to a man in overalls who grabbed them, hung them by their legs from a scale, then carried them into a room strewn with feathers and drew a knife across their throats.“You can put your rice to boil, come get a chicken, be home before it burns,” Harry said. “Can’t get fresher than this.”The market he frequents, Madani Halal, is one of more than 80 in New York City that stock live animals and slaughter them on demand for customers. The markets are considered vitally important in many immigrant communities for cultural, religious or health reasons, contributing to the erse culinary landscape for which New York is famous. Since the 1990s the number of markets has nearly doubled, concentrated mostly in outer-borough immigrant neighborhoods. But since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have spread from a live animal market in China, a group of New York lawmakers has sought to shut these markets down, fearing that they pose a disease threat.Bills currently before the New York assembly and senate have requested an immediate moratorium on all live animal markets in the city. If passed, they would see the markets closed until a proposed new taskforce investigates concerns about public health and animal welfare in the sector.But critics of this plan, including researchers and community activists, say it unfairly targets immigrants, and is unlikely to reduce the risk of disease. They argue that it blurs issues of health and animal rights while overlooking the wider harms of industrial meat production.“This isn’t about food safety,” said Richard David, an activist from south Queens, home to a large number of the city’s live markets. “This is about food justice.”Some so-called “wet markets” in Asia, named for the common practice of hosing them down with water, stock exotic wildlife alongside live animals, providing a potential nexus for diseases to spread. This has led to growing calls around the world to ban them, even though the precise history of the coronavirus pandemic, widely thought to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, is still unclear.But the term “wet markets” has become confusing in the process, mixing up wildlife consumption with less exotic traditions, such as the poultry markets of New York. This has led to a situation where, in the rush to create a safer food system, culturally significant food practices, which pose comparatively minor public health risks, are coming under threat.In New York, animal rights groups have begun campaigning vigorously on issues of food safety, including staging protests outside markets. A recent petition by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) urges officials to shut down “blood-soaked slaughterhouses” in New York, specifically referring to the facilities as “wet markets” in an accompanying video. Peta has also urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to denounce live animal markets globally. The WHO has resisted these demands, saying that live markets provide food and jobs for millions of people.“Nobody is in favor of unsanitary markets,” said Nevin Cohen, a professor of public health at the Cuny Urban Food Policy Institute. “But instead of the kneejerk reaction of shutting them down, there are other policy tools, such as updating regulations or increasing enforcement.”These could include more frequent inspections and harsher penalties for non-compliance, he explained. “Banning these markets would eliminate some of the cultural ersity of our food system,” Cohen added. “It potentially sanitizes the city, in a bad way.”On a recent weekday morning, Awadh Radhakrishen, a parking garage attendant from Guyana, waited outside Madani Halal for his order. “You see everything here,” he told me. “You know what you’re eating.” But with supermarket chicken there was no way of telling, he said. “It might have been killed two weeks ago, two states away.”Live markets were a fundamental facet of New York’s culinary landscape until the rise of refrigeration in the 20th century. Modern supply chains physically distanced consumers from producers, increasingly shielding them from what the American food writer Michael Pollan has called “the shame of killing”. For this and other reasons, such as urbanization and rising incomes, meat consumption increased massively. At the same time, the harms of meat production multiplied, from toxic runoff at feedlots to the slaughterhouses that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots, predominantly for low-paid immigrants and people of color.While that supply chain remains largely invisible, establishments like Madani Halal are wide open to public scrutiny. “It’s easier to pick on the little guy,” said Imran Uddin, the market’s owner.A big man with a full beard, Uddin left a career in advertising 20 years ago to take over the business from his father, a Bengali immigrant who began selling poultry in 1996. Uddin’s customers come from far and wide: the Caribbean, Latin America, China, south-east Asia. There are Punjabi Sikhs who buy and slaughter their own chickens, observing religious custom, and old Italian men from a different era in the neighborhood, when it was home mostly to European immigrants. “I see fewer of them each year,” Uddin said.Like all New York live markets, Madani Halal is licensed by the state department of agriculture and markets, subject to random inspections – of the animals and facilities – about once a month. Yet Uddin says he is in favor of even stricter regulation, conceding that some markets “cut corners”.According to the bill before the New York senate, inspectors have issued “a litany of violations” at live animal markets, including sidewalks with blood and feces and “allowing grime to accumulate on butchering equipment”.“Many of these markets can and should be improved,” said Krishnendu Ray, an associate professor of food studies at New York University. “But calls to eliminate them serve only to invoke disgust against the small practices of small people – while leaving intact the very large systems that are threats to health, animal welfare and the environment.”While organizations like Peta also campaign against industrial meat production, those corporations are vastly more powerful and less sensitive to activism.“If the alternative to these markets is mass-produced meat, we’re talking about displacing risk elsewhere, not reducing it,” said Cohen.Uddin recently drafted a petition for his customers, placing it on a clipboard at the cashier’s window. It reads: “I implore our representatives to reconsider the support for this new bill and empathize with the different cultural, ethnic and religious communities you represent.”So far, a few hundred people have signed, he said. Other customers had declined, wary of drawing attention to their immigration status. The petition by Peta has nearly 50,000 signatures. “People fear what they don’t know,” Uddin said.Uddin got into his truck and drove across the neighborhood with a delivery. Gousul Anwar, a Bangladeshi man who runs a dollar store in Manhattan’s Chinatown, was at home due to the pandemic he came to the door barefoot and in a shirt that read “Don’t panic”. He’d been buying meat from Uddin for more than 15 years, he said – and before that, from Uddin’s father. So had Anwar’s cousin, a slender man with a long beard who was sitting outside his apartment across the street. He waved and greeted Uddin warmly in Bengali. Both cousins were growing potted plants – tomatoes, peppers – fertilized with manure from Madani Halal.With only minor modifications, the scene resembled a kind of farm-to-table fantasy: the owner of a family business, delivering food and organic waste to customers he knew personally, providing a functioning, affordable alternative to the industrial meat system. Except in this case the participants weren’t virtuous middle-class shoppers, but working immigrants – “the fabric of New York”, Uddin called them afterwards.“They’ve left behind friends and family,” he said. “They work multiple jobs – the jobs Americans don’t want. And at the end of the day they want something that reminds them of home.“Those people are my customers,” he went on. “It disturbs me that people want to take this away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2df4f36cbc3c335dabe1bdb8a7a36f433a3e428/0_356_5044_3026/master/5044.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f8d28e3b2303c514ac8715c517603022","title":"kim joy recipe for underwater themed creme brulee","story":"Crab yourself some dessert delightCreme brulee is baked in a bath of water to make sure the custard cooks evenly, so it’s fitting for it to have an underwater-themed decoration.

Add the double cream, milk and vanilla to a pan, then stir occasionally over a medium heat until just starting to bubble. Gradually pour this over the egg and sugar mixture, whisking constantly as you pour.Ladle the mixture evenly between the four ramekins. You can use a spoon to scoop off the bubbles for a smoother appearance after baking, although this isn’t necessary. Fill the baking tray with warm water, until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the ramekins (don’t get water inside).Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the creme brulee has a slight wobble in the centre.Carefully take the ramekins out from the hot water using an oven glove, or wait for the water to cool a little before removing.

Sport in the time of plague: this was never an easy prospect. In the event the Premier League’s live return was jarring, dream-like and lodged at all times on the spectrum between startlingly odd and startlingly everyday. Some things were reassuringly the same. Grass remains green. The ball is still round. And Mesut Özil didn’t turn up. Literally so on this occasion: Özil was left out of Arsenal’s match-day squad for the trip to Manchester City.Football even had something special for us. Not just an infuriating debate about technology, but an infuriating watch-buzzing goalline conspiracy theorist shemozzle, as Michael Oliver’s wristband failed to vibrate as the ball crossed the Aston Villa line in the night’s first match.Best of all there was even a little genuine exhilaration as, in between the strangulating protocols, and the sense of some formal dance being staged in no-man’s land, Kevin De Bruyne dished up his own little vision of the sublime on a rainy night in Manchester. It came from a standing start. The atmosphere at the Etihad was, of course, eerie and strange. But then the world is an eerie and strange place at the moment. Non-eeriness, an absence of strangeness: well, that really would be jarring.Pep Guardiola picked a strong team for City’s game in hand, the selection of a manager still with an eye on that condensed Champions League. Arsenal looked callow on paper. Mikel Arteta has spoken of his desire to create a spikier, more aggressive team, or at least one that is, to any noticeable degree, spiky and aggressive. He picked a commendably young, quick starting XI here, with Bukayo Saka, Joe Willock and Eddie Nketiah, 18, 20 and 21, in the front four.Otherwise this is an Arsenal team of odds and ends. Pablo Marí made his second league start and went off with an injured achilles. Granit Xhaka was also taken off on a stretcher early on, to be replaced by Dani Ceballos, who might have expected to be back in Madrid by now, but has instead become the football equivalent of an overdue library book.For a while Arsenal stifled City’s midfield and threatened their high defensive line. Steadily, though, something else began to happen. Mainly De Bruyne happened. Midway through the first half something just clicked, muscle memory kicking in, City’s midfielder duke timing his passes and his runs, turning a slightly frantic game a cool shade of blue.Some things are inisible, unaffected by the oddity around them. Extreme talent is one of them. David Luiz’s ability to flap wildly inside his own penalty area appears to be another. It was De Bruyne’s pass that led to the opening goal just before half-time, although David Luiz provided his own on-field welcome basket, producing a failed knee-trap that simply nudged the ball to Raheem Sterling close to goal. He smashed it across Bernd Leno and into the back of the net.De Bruyne kept on driving the game from the centre of the pitch. And four minutes into the second half David Luiz decided the game, dragging down Riyad Mahrez, conceding a penalty, earning himself a red card and completing a truly miserable – and these are some rare standards of misery – 26 minutes on the pitch. De Bruyne ked the kick into the corner.And that was pretty much that for a game that was just as much about the process of restarting this global show. At both games there was a genuinely moving minute’s silence before kick-off, no doubt felt very personally by some of those around the pitch. Since we were all last here 42,000 British people have died of this wretched viral bug, and many others of its ripple effects.The players at Villa Park and the Etihad also took a knee, a moment that felt unapologetically powerful. In Sofia last year Tyrone Mings played through horrendous racist barracking with grace, strength and tangible defiance. This is not simply a gesture. For now the rows of empty plastic seats seemed touching, a significant absence.No doubt we will get used to the TV presentation. At Villa Park the pitch-side pundits stood coolly apart, motionless as wedding cake figurines. At the Etihad the managers lined up in front of their advert boards for a long-range pre-match interview as though calmly facing down a firing squad.The lack of stadium noise offers a choice for the home viewer. The piped crowd sound on Sky was a vague, restless whooshing, like the sound of a seashell clasped to your ear, albeit a seashell filled with a billion football-obsessed sea microbes. The sea-microbes chuntered restlessly, occasionally joining in a shout, then dying back just as quickly.But it was on balance preferable to the real-life managerial shouting option. At the Etihad there were shrieks and screams. For long periods at Villa Park the noises-off suggested a lone spectator being thrashed with a piece of rope somewhere up in the eaves of the Holte End, bellows of manfully borne agony mixed with shouts of “our ball” and “corner”.City’s 3-0 victory was crowned by a goal from Phil Foden, and marred by the worrying sight of Eric García being carried off after colliding with Ederson.Otherwise this was a successful return, both for the Premier League itself and for City, who played their own kind of physical-distance football, easing through the Arsenal midfield without contact or collisions and looking, on this evidence, like a team ready to run to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78edf4effe4255b3f138c1ff96abab0eac49e1f6/280_240_2933_1760/master/2933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f93a341638fdc4977cfe67ff29a6105","title":"mario balotelli v massimo cellino and a homecoming that turned sour","story":"The striker’s return to the town where he grew up has become a battle between him and the local club’s owner, Massimo CellinoMario Balotelli’s stomach ache returned over the weekend. The Brescia striker had only been allowed back into his club’s training base last Wednesday after six days off with gastroenteritis. He was scheduled for a pair of inidual workouts on Saturday but left the facility after completing the first, having suffered an apparent relapse. A post on his Instagram Stories simply said: “Sick.”Hours earlier, he had shared a video of himself on the same platform, still sweating from the morning practice session. “Stop asking if I’m going to training or not,” he said. “I’m going to training guys. I have always been training.”He has not done it with his teammates, though, since early March. When Serie A clubs were given the green light to resume training last month, Balotelli was notably absent from Brescia’s group work. The club’s owner, Massimo Cellino, told the BBC World Service: “He doesn’t show up to training, he doesn’t look very committed, let’s say, for the future of the club.”The question of who was responsible for such non-attendance may finish up in court. Cellino began proceedings this month to have Balotelli’s contract terminated for just cause, an extraordinary step when you consider that it was already likely to expire this summer. The one-year deal Balotelli signed last August would automatically be extended if Brescia avoided relegation, but they are bottom of Serie A, with nine points to make up in 12 games.The picture painted by the club is of a player who opted out. Asked by the newspaper Corriere della Sera why Balotelli was not training with the first-team squad, Brescia’s manager, Diego López, blamed a failure to engage during lockdown with online training tools provided by the club.“It was optional, OK, but the rest of the group took one path and he took the other,” said López. “During quarantine, on Zoom, he did not show himself. Even if he says he is in good shape, he is not on the level of his teammates.”Balotelli has not spoken so directly on the matter, but his social media posts and brief interactions with the press suggest that he feels unfairly excluded. After his first bout of gastroenteritis, he sought to resume training at Brescia’s facility on 9 June, but was turned away at the gates – apparently because he had not updated the club early enough about his recovery. As he trudged back to his car, he was heard protesting: “Then they say that I won’t train.”The dispute has other threads. Balotelli has initiated legal action against Brescia over unpaid wages from March. His agent, Mino Raiola, accused the club of failing to put Balotelli through a mandatory Covid-19 test. Brescia defined that latter claim as “false and slanderous”, warning that their legal team had been instructed to pursue the matter in the relevant chambers. Balotelli has been invited to give his account to an Italian Football Federation hearing on Thursday.How did it come to this? Balotelli’s move to Brescia was supposed to be a triumphant homecoming, a rare talent – albeit one whose potential had never been fully realised – returning to the town where he grew up, to play for the team he once served as a ballboy. The Rondinelle (Little Swallows) had just been promoted to the top flight after eight years outside it. They believed Balotelli could deliver the goals to keep them there.He is the club’s top scorer this season but five goals in 19 games are hardly transformative. In a tale familiar from too many other stops in his career, Balotelli has sparkled only intermittently, serving up brilliant goals against Verona and Lazio but failing to leave a mark on other occasions. Two of Brescia’s four wins so far this season arrived while he was still serving out a suspension picked up at his previous club, Nice.Were the expectations on him always unrealistic? Brescia’s squad are not without talent – the 20-year-old midfielder Sandro Tonali is one of Italian football’s brighter prospects – but lack the depth to thrive at this level. Cellino’s impatience has not helped, either. He fired Eugenio Corini as manager in November, replacing him with Fabio Grosso for three games before swapping back. Corini lost the job again in February, this time being replaced by López.It is not easy for any player to adjust constantly to different managers with different ideas about how the game should be played, but the changes can only feel more acute for one who tends to be singled out for special treatment. Grosso threw Balotelli out of a training session and excluded him from a trip to Roma. López gave him the captain’s armband.On top of all this, Balotelli also found himself back at the centre of Italian football’s continuing struggle with racism. He was subjected to monkey chants during the defeat at Verona and responded by kicking a ball at the perpetrators. The opposition manager, Ivan Juric, and president, Maurizio Setti, ridiculously insisted no racist abuse had taken place.That claim was contradicted by independent observers but, even then, the partial stadium closure handed down as a punishment was appealed into a suspended sentence. One ultra was banned from attending games by Verona after telling a local radio station that, in his eyes, Balotelli could never be “fully Italian”.Even in Brescia’s own stadium, Balotelli has been targeted. A game against Lazio was interrupted as the PA and the visitors’ manager, Simone Inzaghi, implored away fans to stop making racist chants.Then there were Cellino’s remarks in November. Asked about Grosso’s decision to drop Balotelli, the owner replied: “What can I say? That he’s black and he’s working to whiten himself but he has great difficulties in this.”It was defended by some as a play on words – “nero”, the Italian word for “black” is sometimes used as an adjective to stress a deep level of anger – but Cellino refused even to acknowledge that his phrasing could have upset anyone.Only Balotelli can know how greatly these incidents did or didn’t affect him. From the outside looking in, we can only observe the broad arc of what can feel at times like a story stuck on repeat: optimistic beginnings giving way to a fractious end.In the lexicon of Italian football, “stomach ache” has frequently been used as a euphemism for a player’s desire to change clubs: a call-back to Zlatan Ibrahimovic telling a reporter that his questions were causing him such symptoms during his final season at Inter. Balotelli could find worse models than the Swede for how a striker can continue to reinvent themselves into a fourth decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30783bb909a44516f3a75dd1786e788d06664d8/0_0_3506_2105/master/3506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a706e1507763dfd9554f8a3528da8746","title":"mexico churches catholic mass covid 19 coronavirus","story":"Thousands of worshippers sneak in to invitation-only assemblies organized like illegal dance parties, despite rising death tollsThe invitations arrive via text message or social media. “They ask you for a kind of password to let you in,” said Jesús Preciado, whose father has attended the secretive gatherings in the Mexican state of Jalisco.Diego Martínez, whose mother has attended the backstairs events, said they were off-limits to anyone not in the know. “It’s invitation-only,” he said. “They call you and tell you the place and the date.”The assemblies into which Preciado, Martínez and thousands of other Mexicans have been sneaking might be organised like illegal dance parties. But they are actually clandestine Catholic masses that have continued to take place in defiance of a coronavirus ban on religious events.“The bells don’t ring, there are no calls to mass,” said Antonio Hernández, who has watched worshippers steal into secret sessions at the Sagrado Corazón de Jesús church in the town of Ixtapa.“You just see the people arrive a few minutes before 6.30pm, enter the temple through the back door and then after that you start to hear their prayers,” Hernández added.The Mexican Episcopal Conference suspended mass in early March, when the first coronavirus cases were reported in Mexico.Days later the federal government suspended all religious activities involving crowds.Worshippers at the Nuestra Señora de Fátima church in Zacatecas have been allowed into secret masses on the condition they sit behind the camera live-streaming the liturgy on Facebook.In Jalisco’s capital, Guadalajara, the faithful have continued to frequent the San José y Santo Tomás de Aquino church.“I went to mass on Sunday, behind closed doors, and there were just 12 of us in the congregation,” said Susana García, a 64-year-old regular.In Durango state, catechists, choir members and youth leaders have received written notice of the underground rituals. “Only people close to the church go,” said Vicente Martínez, a member of the Catholic community in the city of Gómez Palacios.Martínez said all churches had been closed there. “But they have hidden activities for 30 or 40 people each Thursday. They do a callout where they describe it as an exclusive and private mass with refreshments after.”In late May authorities launched a mid-mass raid on one local church, the Nuestra Señora de la Luz, and caught 20 people, mostly elderly women, praying red-handed.In Brazil, home to the world’s largest Catholic congregation and also a rapidly growing and politically powerful community of born-again Christians, evangelicals have also made surreptitious church visits.“Lift up your hands and shout: ‘I wasn’t chosen to hide myself!’” Pastor Gilvrando Rodrigues shouted at a recent service for about 80 believers at his church in Rio’s biggest favela, Rocinha.“I won’t accept having to cower in a cave, I won’t accept hiding in a hole because I have a calling from God,” Rodrigues added as he encouraged his flock – most of whom were not wearing face masks – to flout social isolation for their faith.“You could have stayed at home. But you needed to be here taking care of your salvation,” the preacher said.Such services have been easier to pull off in Rio than Mexico.The city’s mayor, Marcelo Crivella, is an evangelical bishop from the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God who, alongside Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been actively pushing for churches to reopen.Rio’s state governor outlawed religious gatherings in mid-March when a partial shutdown began and a legal tug-of-war has been playing out ever since over whether churches should open, or not.“It’s all very confused,” said Rodrigues. Last week a judge ruled services could resume.Bolsonaro, who is heavily reliant on the support of some of Brazil’s most influential televangelists, has defended the right to worship and dismissed the coronavirus as a “little flu” even as his country’s death toll has soared to more than 45,000 – the second-highest tally in the world after the US.At least 60 of those deaths happened in Rocinha and Rodrigues, who himself contracted the disease early in the pandemic, admitted the virus was no joke.“But we can’t stop proclaiming the word of Christ either,” he insisted, calling churches an essential service.The pastor claimed God had allowed the pandemic, partly in order to help transform the church. Faith had become a commodity, Rodrigues complained.At a recent Sunday service he told congregants: “You’ve listened to the word and received God’s blessing. And now, whoever would like to pay tribute to the house of the Lord, feel free.“Those who give, receive,” Rodrigues added, as he asked for help to fund building work on the church. “And those who sow, will reap.”Some of the names in this report have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eea7bef72fa35bc81fa73b12bb23f585bbdb0cb/0_0_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e00714bc18766e42e50cb4ba4f593eed","title":"senior cps lawyer investigated for posting britain first petition","story":"Kim Kendall shared petition on Facebook calling for statue of ‘terrorist’ Nelson Mandela to be ‘torn down’ A senior lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is under investigation after a petition from far-right group Britain First calling for the statue of Nelson Mandela to be “torn down” was posted on her Facebook page.The petition was shared on the Facebook page of Kim Kendall, a senior lawyer at the Yorkshire and Humberside CPS. It accuses Mandela of being “a communist and terrorist mass murderer” who should be “consigned to the dustbin of history”.An aspect of Black Lives Matter protests following the killing of George Floyd in America has focused on removing statues of figures associated with racism and the oppression of black people, including that of Edward Colston in Bristol.CPS employees are civil servants and required to be impartial, particularly when making decisions about whether inidual cases should proceed to court or not.Kendall’s investigation by her employers follows complaints by at least two lawyers who were concerned about the material on her Facebook page. Other posts which appeared on her timeline and referred for investigation include one originally posted by another Facebook user about the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby, saying: “I don’t remember the UK rioting after 2 black immigrants hacked to death a white British soldier in broad daylight … Just saying!”At the top of Kendall’s Facebook page was a March 2018 change.org petition calling for Asian Labour MP Naz Shah “to resign or be sacked”.It is understood one of the complaints called for a review of all of Kendall’s cases involving black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) defendants or complainants. The matter has also been referred to the Solicitors Regulation Authority.Kendall’s Facebook was removed after the  approached the CPS.According to the CPS Code of Conduct employees must not post statements on Facebook or other social media which contravenes their obligations. “Employees must not compromise their political neutrality,” the code adds.Standards of conduct include “ensuring personal views do not influence the way an employee carries out their official work”.Richard Lunn, a solicitor and director at Haywood, Lunn and Allen, one of the lawyers who called on the CPS to investigate Kendall’s Facebook posts, said: “We in the legal profession need to be completely objective, not allow our personal views to influence our work, nor put anything on social media that would reduce faith in our profession. The system works because of trust that those doing the job are completely objective. If that trust disappears the system will fail.”Attiq Malik, a criminal lawyer who saw Kendall’s posts, expressed alarm about them: “As a campaigning lawyer against racism it is extremely concerning to learn that there are those in our profession who have Britain First posts appearing on their Facebook page.”He added that in the criminal justice system it is vital for public confidence that any structural racism is combatted and that those who pass through the system are dealt with fairly and impartially.A CPS spokesperson said: “Impartiality and fairness are central CPS values and these are underpinned by a clear code of conduct. Any allegations of inappropriate behaviour are taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly.”Last month Paul Golding, leader of Britain First, was found guilty of an offence under the Terrorism Act after refusing to give police access to his mobile phone on his return from a political trip to Russia.Kendall’s husband is Mark Kendall, coroner for Grimsby and North Lincolnshire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4236fa14930ddf2de650188ae86c7a1e9d60235b/0_178_7819_4692/master/7819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5b325f7d5c989d7aea435def2d5f6d4","title":"covid clearout charity shop lockdown coronavirus scope communities","story":"Many of us have missed the likes of Scope just as much as Primark or John Lewis. We spend a day with happily returning customers, donors and staffThere’s a new purple wheelie bin on Walthamstow High Street in north-east London, outside No 210, and it’s filling up fast. Michael Armstrong and Louise Craven have just put a bag of books in. “We’ve got several bags from lockdown tidying and we’re going to bring it in one bag at a time,” says Michael. He doesn’t sound like he’s from north-east London. Because he isn’t – he’s originally from California. He came here 40 years ago, “for the weather”, says Craven, his partner, drolly.Her irony maybe backfires a little today. It’s a glorious day in Walthamstow – the high street is pretty much Sunset Boulevard minus the palms.Among the books is what Armstrong describes as “some rather odd poetry journals”, a study of American architecture and The Glass Room by Simon Mawer, which they have both read and recommend.They’re not getting thrown away but recycled, hopefully reread. Because No 210, set between a betting shop and a fish bar, is a charity shop belonging to Scope, the national disability charity. This week, like other non-essential retailers, charity shops in England were able to open for the first time in almost three months, to customers and for donations.Another bag goes into the purple bin. This one contains a brown jacket from Ben Odamtten, who says it’s too small for him. There’s also a card holder and two pairs of shades in his bag. And I have donated a couple of bags, mostly of outgrown children’s clothes. I wanted to bring the popcorn machine, too, but my family wouldn’t let me. No one needs a popcorn machine.Scope’s area manager, Lara Woolston, explains the new process. Donations go from the purple bin into heavy-duty bin bags, which are labelled with the date, tied up with giant rubber bands, taken to a room above the store and left for 72 hours to minimise any risk of infection. Safety of staff, volunteers and customers is Scope’s priority, I’m told, often.The acting shop manager, Celia Mullins, is up here, busy clearing out bays that can be filled in date order. Quarantine for donated clothes, books, CDs, sunglasses etc is going to be stricter and better organised than it is for arrivals at UK airports. There’s already a lot of stuff up here, but if it fills up there is an overflow storage unit in Barking.They have done a lot on the shop floor, too, putting in all the necessary safety measures. It has all been unmuddled and decluttered the rummage boxes – with things, such as toys, that kids would play with – have been removed from the floor. “We’re trying to limit the number of times people need to touch things,” says Woolston.Fitting room? Not any more – it’s taped off like a crime scene. Buy it if it doesn’t fit, bring it back. And there’s a one-way system, with arrows on the floor, plus “sneeze screens” at the tills. Customers are offered hand sanitiser along with a mask and gloves on entering. “It’s been a long time since we’ve been able to welcome our wonderful community through our doors,” says Woolston. For the moment though, they are only allowing one person – or one family – in at a time.It’s the same story across the whole sector: the pandemic makes no allowances for good causes. The chancellor Rishi Sunak’s £750m bailout fund for charities didn’t come close to replacing lost income, not just because of shops being closed but also because of the cancellation of other means of fundraising – the London Marathon and the Great North Run to name two massive ones. Street-funding, too, as well as the possibility that people are more likely to give to NHS charities at the moment. A study published last week found that one in 10 charities faces bankruptcy by the end of the year as they struggle with a £10bn shortfall caused by a perfect storm of massive income reduction and rocketing demand for their services. “It’s been a devastating loss of income,” Scope’s head of retail, Debbie Boylen, tells me over the phone. “Because it’s been at a time when disabled people need us the most.”I could have spent the morning at any charity shop and the picture would have been similar. I’ve come to Scope simply because it’s where we usually bring stuff to. That said, my local branch isn’t among the first wave of 16 shops around the country opening as lockdown eases, so I’ve travelled across London. Hence just the two bags: there’s plenty more to come at home, under the stairs, from our own Covid clearout. Boylen thinks it’s not just us. “Everybody I speak to is saying the same, that they’ve been clearing out cupboards and wardrobes over the past few months.”Each bag is worth, on average, £20 to Scope 81 bags would, for example, allow it to run its Parents Connect support programme, for parents and carers of young disabled people in Leeds, for a week.The bin is soon full, the contents bagged up and taken up to Mullins to be placed in quarantine. This system for dropping stuff doesn’t allow gift aid to be claimed for donations, says Woolston, so they miss out on that, but it’s unavoidable with the only-one-in-the-shop policy. That may be relaxed, but for now gift aid donors can’t be expected to queue.As well as the purple wheelie bin, that’s the other new thing outside No 210: a queue. Beautifully spaced, orderly, patient, not as long as the ones outside Asda and Lidl down the street but undeniably a queue. It seems the appetite not just to donate but to shop in charity shops is alive and well. “I’ve missed it,” says Shahnaz Khan, one of the first people in. “You can get so many nice things from here, and the people are very nice.” She comes out with a pink handbag.Alan Donoghue, who used to work here and is queuing on a mobility scooter, says it’s a good way to pass the morning. “It does you good mentally, and also sometimes there might be stuff that you want.” He’s not after anything specific, though he’s always on the look out for tea towels, fridge magnets and commemorative plates.Is anyone here for something specific, Woolston asks the queue. “Tennis racket,” says a man named Mike Anderson. He tells me he’s started playing a bit in order to start seeing people. He has been borrowing his friend’s girlfriend’s racket but now is the time to take responsibility. Two minutes later, Woolston is back out of the shop with a choice of two: Anderson opts for the more expensive, a Slazenger for a fiver. The deal is done on the street. “Probably illegally,” laughs Woolston.Anderson is chuffed enough with his purchase. “Charity shop, so, you know, standards are slightly lower,” he says. “But it looks lovely, it’s got its own cover if anybody saw me walking towards a tennis court they would think I was going to play tennis, which is half the battle won, isn’t it?”Nina Bright doesn’t shop anywhere but charity shops, except for socks and underwear. So she hasn’t bought any clothes for three months. She’s just happy to be out looking and isn’t bothered about the queue. “It’s fine – I’ve got nothing else to do,” she says. Nor is she bothered that, once she does get inside the shop, she doesn’t find anything to buy. She dismisses it as “the lottery of thrifting”.Maybe Odion Edgal will be more successful. She’s on the hunt for books she ran out over lockdown. “I miss books a lot – I need something to read.” She finds something – not Armstrong and Craven’s odd poetry journals or American Architecture, but Camp David, David Walliams’s 2012 autobiography. For £2. “That’s why I come – I can’t afford to go to Waterstones.”There have been 56 bags of donations in Walthamstow. Not quite enough for a week of Parents Connect, unless there are some treasures in there – a Mulberry handbag perhaps – and Woolston and Mullins won’t know for another couple of days, when they can open up the bags. Maybe those poetry journals will turn out to be rare treasures and can be sold at auction for millions. Maybe.It’s going to pick up further as more charity shops open and people realise this, and then get their acts together to get down there. I know of several bags destined for a purple bin in the near future one of them might just have a kitchen gadget snuck in there. Maybe someone does need a popcorn maker – just not me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16bfb869cbb12945dc9ce347f4b5ef03781984cd/0_52_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d3466d6486a5d97bd44214933925f2","title":"buskers return to british london streets coronavirus","story":"As lockdown measures are eased, street musicians entertain the queues of shoppers – but there are concerns about how to pay themOn 13 March, singer-songwriter Sherika Sherard completed her final busk at London Bridge. Given the increasing seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic, her mum hadn’t wanted her to go. She did anyway. “We weren’t yet under lockdown – and it was one of the best sessions,” said Sherard. After three months on the government’s income support scheme for self-employed people, she was back on the capital’s streets on 16 June, entertaining the queue outside Selfridges’ Oxford Street store as part of its programme of “joyful experiences”. “People will really appreciate it now, as long as buskers are mindful,” said Sherard. “Buskers in London is a sign of the norm.”The day before, in Manchester, Laurie Wright was on the first stop of his It Could Be Worse, You Could Be on Lockdown mini tour, performing covers and originals for the queues in Market Street to a noisy reception. “I came out because the shops are opening again, and there’s money to be made,” he said. “It’s good to be out and for things to be kind of moving back to normal, even if they’re not.”Buskers know that their artistry depends on cooperation with local communities and councils, especially since they must now be mindful about crowds and social distancing. Despite pre-pandemic crackdowns on city-centre buskers, many councils have included busking in their plans for the public returning to the high street. Cardiff city council will create a number of “spill-out” spaces where managed social activities such as busking can resume. Cheshire West and Chester council stated that buskers can return “as long as they observe two-metre distancing and don’t attract a crowd of spectators that makes social distancing difficult or causes an obstruction”. The city has a street welcome team offering guidance to buskers on maintaining social distancing.While buskers have been off the streets during lockdown, their music has not ceased. The organisation Keep Streets Live, which seeks to protect public spaces for “informal offerings of music and the arts”, invited buskers to live-stream performances on their Facebook page, where appreciative listeners could tip via PayPal. Classical guitarist busker Billy Watman has been virtually busking on Facebook, collecting tips through The Busking Project, which offers buskers an online showcase. Watman does not see this as a solution, but “the best we can do at the time”.Sherard said she had been offered streaming opportunities on the social media platforms of several brands, who did not offer payment. “They were just wanting more content on their pages,” she says. The emphasis on exposure over payment is a sticking point: “Putting your phone to record and singing live is not really going to cost the companies that much.”The return to the high street brings with it concerns about the exchange of physical money. While the World Health Organisation countered claims that banknotes could transmit Covid-19, it has emphasised the importance of hand-washing after handling cash. Keep Streets Live’s Safe and Socially Distant Busking Guide recommends that buskers use “a box with plastic inside for your drops” but stresses the public health benefits of a cashless reader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07de3d4e5a99b09873b75b434511ad1b87040e56/0_35_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61629db6887876ac34a49894fcd97ecc","title":"stranded at sea crew members trapped on cruise ships","story":" US reporter Erin McCormick describes why thousands of crew are still stranded on cruise ships after coronavirus bought the industry to a standstill in March.

This is the story of how its invention went on to change the world“The best thing since sliced bread.” We’ve all heard the saying. It’s synonymous with greatness, a new invention, a game-changer. But the road to greatness is seldom easy.Sliced bread was first sold in July 1928, in a bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri. The bakery used an automatic bread-slicing machine invented by jeweller Otto Rohwedder. It had been hard work to get to that point: Rohwedder had tried for some time to introduce the US to sliced bread. He’d carried out extensive market research, surveying tens of thousands of people on the perfect thickness of a slice. And his prototype machine and all his blueprints were lost to a fire in 1917.Despite grumbling from the baking industry, which voiced concerns about his new-fangled idea, the concept became a hit. The Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune hailed the “thrill of pleasure” that a housewife would get at no longer having to carve up a whole loaf. “So neat and precise are the slices, and so definitely better than anyone could possibly slice by hand with a bread knife that one realises instantly that here is a refinement that will receive a hearty and permanent welcome,” it said. The page was topped with a slogan describing the invention as: “The greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped” – the phrase that became today’s “greatest thing since sliced bread”.But Rohwedder’s creation wasn’t an instant hit. Pre-sliced loaves went stale faster than whole loaves, and some shoppers also felt they were “sloppy looking”. Rohwedder wasn’t deterred. He produced u-shaped pins to hold loaves together, so they looked more appealing.Yet it still wasn’t plain sailing for the humble sliced loaf. As soon as they got used to their easier-to-use bread, Americans were robbed of it. In early 1943 the government banned it, citing the war effort, with steel for bread-slicing machines required for weaponry, and the thick wax paper also needed for more important uses. “The ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if it is not to dry out,” US food administrator Claude R Wickard told the New York Times. “So, the order prohibiting the slicing of bread is aimed at affecting economies in the manufacture of bread and in the use of paper.”Fast forward to 2020 and sliced bread is now commonplace worldwide. Like any great invention, its history is full of highs and lows, victories and losses, innovation and invention.

In the end, they transformed computing as we know itWhen legendary chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov found himself beaten by IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer, it was seen as a seminal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence.It was New York, 1997 and for the first time ever a computer had beaten a world champion under tournament conditions. This was the culmination of a journey in which the first stirrings of what we now call artificial intelligence and machine learning were born. A road trodden by war heroes and student researchers alike, whose singular desire to create a program that could beat the very best in the world would shape an entire science.Early originsChess lends itself well to computer programming. Where other games can depend more on gut instinct or physical skill, chess is a game of strict binary rules – a move is either correct or it isn’t.It’s a game where multiple permutations, strategies and responses to moves and gambits could all be pre-programmed. Teaching a computer how to select the best option from those available to counter a problem, though, was the tricky part, and that’s where machine learning came in.Given the close relationship between chess, logic and programming it’s no surprise that the driving forces of early computerised incarnations of chess were academics whose love of the game dovetailed with their desire to push the boundaries of the burgeoning field of computer science.One of those academics was Alan Turing. He may have made his name breaking Nazi ciphers at Bletchley Park, but he also helped lay the early groundwork for computerised chess too. In 1947, while working at the University of Manchester, Turing developed the first simple algorithm that was capable of analysing an opponent’s move one step ahead. Four years later, his academic colleague DG Prinz wrote a program that could solve particular moves, but not play a game.Competitive gamesThe 1960s saw computer chess start to come into its own. In 1967, MacHack VI, a program written by MIT student Richard Greenblatt, was able to draw a game in a US Chess Federation tournament, losing four. But this was just the start and its results began to improve.New York City hosted the first US computer championship in 1970 it was won by Chess 3.0, a program put together by a team from Northwestern University.And in 1988, HiTech, a computer developed at Carnegie Mellon University, defeated grandmaster Arnold Denker, in a match. In the same year, another Carnegie Mellon program, Deep Thought, defeated top-notch grandmaster Bent Larsen in a tournament game.Humans strike backDeep Thought’s defeat of Larsen was a huge moment for early AI. But this success was short-lived – the program was easily bested later that year by Garry Kasparov.This setback prompted the team behind Deep Thought to push further and further to refine their model. In their view, Kasparov’s success was simply check – but it wasn’t check mate. The team’s success caught the eye of US computer giant IBM, which brought them aboard as part of a dedicated chess programming group tasked with devising a way to beat Kasparov and they developed a successor to Deep Thought called Deep Blue. It incorporated a sophisticated new multiprocessing system that enabled it to consider as many as 50bn positions in three minutes, about a thousand times faster than Deep Thought’s system.Kasparov vs Deep BlueDeep Blue made its professional chess-playing debut in a six-game match with Kasparov in Philadelphia in February 1996. A bumper $500,000 prize and IBM covering the match on its website – the web was still in its infancy back then – helped draw huge media attention.Deep Blue won the first game, but Kasparov adapted his tactics to win three and draw two of the remaining games to win the match 4–2.But in a six-game rematch held in May 1997 in New York City, an upgraded Deep Blue was able to consider an average of 200m positions a second, twice its previous speed. Its algorithm was also improved with input from human grandmasters.Kasparov played smart though, he was conservative with his moves which threw Deep Blue off balance – it hadn’t expected it. But after resigning the second game even though it was drawable, the Russian said he never recovered mentally. With the match tied at one win, one loss, and three draws, Deep Blue won the decisive final game in 19 moves.Influence on AIThe lessons learned from the desire to create a program that could beat a human chess champion enhanced AI.Murray Campbell, one of IBM’s top AI experts, originally worked on the Deep Thought and Deep Blue projects. He now works on artificial neural networks and credits the quest to master chess programs with helping his team understand the importance of identifying the differences between how humans and machines think, but also in how they’re similar.Efforts to master chess, though, still continue to drive the development of AI. One of the criticisms of Deep Blue and subsequent machines is that they relied on the “brute force” application of their superior memory skills – they could remember more permutations than a human. They could out-calculate, rather than out-think.AI company DeepMind’s algorithm AlphaZero set out to change that. It could teach itself how to play chess and learn from its own mistakes. Not only that, it was able to play with intuition and finesse, destroying the reigning artificial chess champion Stockfish during a match in 2017. It played like a human and at times appeared to even toy with its opponent before delivering a killer blow.Even now, the desire for the perfect tech-mate is continuing to push the boundaries of AI.Technology drives the world, and is the beating heart of every BMW.

A senior member of staff at St Mungo’s, one of the charities leading the Everyone In initiative, said that if they return to the streets “people will die”.Unless officials waive a restriction on foreign nationals with a limited immigration status known as “no recourse to public funds”, about half those currently housed could end up back on the streets, charities told the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, in an open letter signed by around 100 homelessness organisations.“We are dismayed that extended housing support will only be available to those who qualify for welfare benefits,” the letter, coordinated by the campaign group Citizens UK, said.Neil Parkinson, a senior case worker with the homelessness charity Glass Door, added: “Migrants who live and work here legally are often not able to access housing support. They will find a huge challenge to access the private rental sector, especially if they have lost their jobs.”Since lockdown was announced in March, more than 5,400 rough sleepers have been placed in Holiday Inns, Travelodges and Ibis hotels all over of England. Similar schemes are in operation elsewhere in the UK. But there has been growing concern about what happens once initial funding runs out.Many hotels were only booked by local authorities for three months and without a further guarantee of funding, some councils will be forced to find alternative housing for rough sleepers imminently. Dominic Williamson, an executive director at St Mungo’s, which has supported about 2,700 rough sleepers during lockdown, said the scheme had been “a tremendous success” which could be reversed if new housing was not found swiftly.“Without further financial help, councils tell us they may not be able to keep people in hotels for much longer. It is my very real fear that people will die,” he said.Staff working with rough sleepers at the two hotels in east London that have now stopped accommodating rough sleepers said around 70 people had been housed in the two buildings. Around 20 residents were moved to another hotel in Hammersmith charity staff who had been working with the hotels’ inhabitants were told by officials that nobody had ended up back on the street, but they said this was difficult to verify and they were uncertain about where the rest had been rehoused.Several other London hotels are due to close in the next three weeks, but staff have expressed concern that they will not be able to find alternative suitable accommodation for inhabitants. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said:“We’ve been clear that councils must continue to provide safe accommodation to all vulnerable rough sleepers and support those moving on from emergency accommodation in the right way, to ensure their needs are met.“Our new rough sleeping taskforce is ensuring that as many people as possible who have been brought in off the streets in this pandemic do not return to sleeping rough.“To help achieve this, we have provided £3.2bn for councils to help meet Covid-19 pressures on top of specific funding for rough sleeping services. And we have accelerated plans– backed by £433m – which will deliver 6,000 additional homes for former rough sleepers across the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/988dbbaacdc22776af922390b2490eca305904ad/0_66_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4973dccac029f4ec2449a921fbf1ac2","title":"colin kaepernick nfl los angeles chargers anthony lynn","story":"On the same day that the Los Angeles Chargers head coach, Anthony Lynn, said teams would be “crazy” not to look at Colin Kaepernick in the run-up to the new NFL season, Donald Trump says he would support the quarterback returning to the league.During an interview with Washington TV station WJLA, the president was asked if Kaepernick should get another chance in the league. “If he deserves it, he should,” Trump said. “If he has the playing ability. He started off great, and then he didn’t end up very great in terms of a player. He was terrific in his rookie year. I think he was very good in his second year. And then something happened. So his playing wasn’t up to snuff.“The answer is absolutely I would. As far as kneeling, I would love to see him get another shot. But obviously he has to be able to play well. If he can’t play well, I think it would be very unfair.”The 32-year-old Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since the end of the 2016 season, when he began kneeling during the national anthem as a protest against social injustice in the United States. He was then frozen out of the league, but as anti-racism protests have swept the US following the death of George Floyd, there is a feeling teams may be more open to signing Kaepernick, who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2013.Trump’s comments are a far cry from those he made in 2017, when he called players who knelt during the national anthem “sons of bitches”.Earlier on Wednesday, Lynn said Kaepernick is an interesting prospect for NFL teams as the new season approaches.“I haven’t spoken with Colin, not sure where he’s at as far in his career, what he wants to do, but Colin definitely fits the style of quarterback for the system that we’re going to be running,” Lynn told ESPN on Wednesday. “I’m very confident and happy with the three quarterbacks that I have but you can never have too many people waiting on the runway.”Earlier this month, the NFL admitted it had been wrong not to listen to players like Kaepernick who have peacefully protested against social injustice. This week, the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, said he would encourage teams to sign Kaepernick. Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll says he has heard from at least one team interested in signing Kaepernick.While it is unlikely Kaepernick would secure a job as a starter, he is still in his prime years as a player and would be a strong candidate for a back-up role. Kaepernick has continued to stay in shape during his exile from the NFL, and says he still practices five times a week.The 2020 NFL season is scheduled to start in September, with training camps resuming in July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73080c25a42cf8623b9cefa09b4524649ed870c5/411_422_3982_2389/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6ba2587585a4ebc6d3fd5e988f704d3","title":"talking horses moonlight spirit can spring a surprise in gold cup royal ascot horse racing","story":"Straarius deserves plenty of respect as he seeks his Gold Cup hat-trick, but the bookmakers have him too shortStraarius deserves plenty of respect as he seeks his Gold Cup hat-trick at Royal Ascot on Thursday but the bookmakers have him very short indeed at 4-7 after a couple of defeats. After all, it is just 13 days since he chased Ghaiyyath’s tail in the Coronation Cup, which is hardly a conventional Gold Cup preparation.At 10-1, Moonlight Spirit (3.35) is an interesting alternative, since the Godolphin horse seems on his way to becoming a decent stayer.

Is there any way to reinvent an industry that does so much damage? By  Christopher de BellaigueOf all the calamities that befell tourists as the coronavirus took hold, those involving cruise ships stood apart. Contagion at sea inspired a special horror, as pleasure palaces turned into prison hulks, and rumours of infection on board spread between fetid cabins via WhatsApp. Trapped in close proximity to their fellow passengers, holidaymakers experienced the distress of being both victims and agents of infection, as a succession of ports refused them entry.When it began, the deadly situation at sea was seen as a freakish outgrowth of what many still thought of as a Chinese problem. The first ship to suffer a major outbreak was the Diamond Princess. By mid-February, 355 cases had been confirmed aboard, and the ship was held being in quarantine in the port of Yokohama. At the time, the ship accounted for more than half of reported cases outside China. Fourteen passengers on the Diamond Princess would die of the virus.The nightmare at sea has not concluded. Even after passengers from more than 30 afflicted cruise ships were allowed to disembark, and flooded into hospitals, quarantine hotels or on to charter flights home, an estimated 100,000 crew and staff remained trapped at sea, some in quarantine, others blocked from disembarking until their employers could make onward travel arrangements. This second drama led to a mass hunger strike – by 15 Romanian crew in limbo off the coast of Florida – and a police intervention to quell disturbances on a ship quarantined in the German port of Cuxhaven. As recently as 1 June, crew and staff aboard 20-odd cruise ships marooned in Manila Bay were reportedly clamouring to be allowed ashore.Cruises have become a symbol of the ravages that coronavirus has inflicted on tourism. A sector that until January was worth $150bn, by its own estimate, is shedding jobs, issuing debt and discounting furiously simply to survive. But even before the current crisis hit, cruising had become symptomatic of the damage that tourism wreaks on the world.Tourism is an unusual industry in that the assets it monetises – a view, a reef, a cathedral – do not belong to it. The world’s dominant cruise companies – Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian – pay little towards the upkeep of the public goods they live off. By incorporating themselves in overseas tax havens with benign environmental and labour laws – respectively Panama, Liberia and Bermuda – cruising’s big three, which account for three-quarters of the industry, get to enjoy low taxes and avoid much irksome regulation, while polluting the air and sea, eroding coastlines and pouring tens of millions of people into picturesque ports of call that often cannot cope with them.The virus has given us a picture, at once frightening and beautiful, of a world without tourism. We see now what happens to our public goods when tourists aren’t clustering to exploit them. Shorelines enjoy a respite from the erosion caused by cruise ships the size of canyons. Walkers stuck at home cannot litter mountainsides. Intricate culinary cultures are no longer menaced by triangles of defrosted pizza. It is hard to imagine a better illustration of tourism’s effects than our current holiday away from it.As tourism’s impact on the world has deepened, so the global economy has come to depend on it. Now, after the freeze forced upon foreign travel – unimaginable even six months ago – we have a rare opportunity to extract ourselves from this destructive cycle, and do things differently.To accusations that it is spoiling the planet, the tourism industry responds with an economic argument: one in 10 jobs in the world depend on it. Governments tend to like tourism, because it creates jobs in the time it takes a hotel to open and the hot water to come on – and it brings in plenty of foreign money.One industry advocate I spoke to quoted Lelei Lelaulu, a development entrepreneur who, in 2007, described tourism as “the largest voluntary transfer of cash from the rich to the poor, the ‘haves’ to ‘have nots’, in history”. Even if one allows for considerable “leakage” – whereby much of tourists’ expenditure doesn’t go to the destination country but to foreign tour agencies, airlines and hotel chains whose services they use – it cannot be denied that Australians have spent liberally in Bali, Americans in Cancún and Chinese in Bangkok.For all the money the industry usually brings in, one of the prices of allowing a place to be taken over by tourism is the way it distorts local development. Farmers sell their land to the hotel chain, only for the price of crops they once grew to inflate beyond their reach. Water is erted to the golf course while the locals go short. The road is paved as far as the theme park, not the school. In its subordination of an economy to a powerful, capricious, external motor, tourism dependency has something in common with the aid dependency that I observed as a reporter in Afghanistan after the 2001 invasion. In both cases, the worst threat is the possibility of sudden withdrawal.Biggs Bradley pointed to a number of “small, vulnerable” places that will be devastated, such as those islands in the Pacific that have recently become popular with ing tour operators. “They were opened up by the phenomenal rise in new air routes of recent years,” she said, only for the planes to stop arriving, leaving debt and unemployment behind.Tsotne Japaridze, whose tour agency Traffic Travel organises adventure holidays in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, described the pain that the virus inflicted on his business and those who rely on it. Japaridze employs three people full-time, hires 15 guides and drivers during the summer season, and sends tour groups to 30-odd vineyards, guesthouses and private houses around the country. His company can be seen as a powerful core diffusing revenue that supports hundreds of people. At the start of the crisis, Japaridze put his employees on unpaid leave (“It was a difficult decision but I had no option,” he said). As tourism vanished, demand has exploded for services that do not require customers to leave their homes. One of Japaridze’s former guides, who used to take tour groups to the beautiful Svaneti region of Georgia, is now making ends meet by delivering food on his motorbike.If one danger of tourism dependency is that the tourists might suddenly stop arriving, a more common problem is overtourism – the saturation of a destination by visitors in numbers it cannot sustain. Near the peak of the pandemic, I spoke by Zoom to Jane da Mosto, whose NGO, We Are Here Venice, fights valiantly to keep the most noxiously over-touristed place on earth a tolerable place to live.While chopping vegetables for the family supper, Da Mosto confessed to a certain unease at the juxtaposition of apocalypse in Italian hospitals and the scenes of serenity and quiet observable from her window. The bridges were empty and seahorses cavorted in the Grand Canal, while peddlers of phallic-shaped pasta had been replaced by boatmen delivering homemade tortellini to the city’s residents.When Da Mosto moved out of view to attend to her potatoes, her place was occupied by her 19-year-old son, Pierangelo. From the day he first slid behind the wheel of his father’s boat, Pierangelo has lived for the water, and he feels queasy if obliged to sit in a car. He works as a carpenter and a restorer of the city’s famous keel-less boats, while also beetling about on an electric launch and showing tourists “Venice from a Venetian perspective”.A Venetian who acknowledges the importance of tourism but longs to relax its grip, Pierangelo and his friends – designers, students, fellow carpenters – had been discussing life after the virus, when, with fewer visitors, they would be faced with a steep drop in income, and would be obliged to make up the shortfall by drumming up business from local residents.And how, I asked, does he feel when he’s bobbing on the Giudecca Canal and turns to see a cruise ship bearing down on him?Were it not for tourism, much of Venice’s Gothic fabric would have crumbled or been redeveloped years ago. But while the tourism industry provided much of the economic rationale for the preservation of the city’s architecture provided the economic rationale for visitors, power was handed to investors in hotels, restaurants and boats, many of them outsiders for whom Venice was simply a business opportunity. On 15 July 1989, the global music industry commandeered the city for a free concert, the memory of which vexes Venetians even now. As many as 200,000 people from all over Europe converged that day on the Piazza San Marco, the city’s spiritual and aesthetic core, some of them packed on to boats offshore, to see Pink Floyd on the final leg of their world tour.Panicky city councillors argued almost until the opening note of Shine on You Crazy Diamond about whether the concert should go ahead. In the end, the band agreed to lower the decibels and shorten their playlist to fit global TV schedules (Italian national broadcaster Rai did very nicely), while shopkeepers around the square sold warm beer at triple the price to fans who discovered too late that the authorities hadn’t laid on a single toilet. The following morning, the famous old flagstones were covered by cans, cigarette butts and puddles of urine.As an example of tourism squatting on the public good, an invasion of a medieval city centre by 200,000 people who pay no entry fee and leave the city to clear up their mess is hard to beat. One Italian TV report described the concert as a violation of human rights, “those of the invaders and those of the invaded”. So virulent was criticism of the city council that its members resigned en masse.Long before the invasion by rock fans, residents had been deserting the city. Between 1950 and 2019, Venice’s population dropped from about 180,000 to nearer 50,000, while the number of annual visitors rose from 1 million to 30 million. According to Jan van der Borg, a tourism specialist who teaches at Venice’s Ca’ Foscari University, and advises tourism authorities across Europe, this exceeds the city’s “carrying capacity”, the number it can accommodate without permanently damaging its infrastructure and way of life, by at least 10 million.Whether it is a gondola owner who lives far away and deputes someone else to row tourists through the packed canals, or the budget airlines that deposit thousands of tourists every day in an area barely one and a half times the size of New York’s Central Park, in Da Mosto’s words, “a huge number of people live off Venice without living in it”.According to the unapologetic elitism that informs the thinking of Van der Borg and other industry strategists, “high-impact, low-value” excursionists should be made less welcome than the affluent independent travellers who stay in a hotel, eat at neighbourhood restaurants and perhaps round off a day in the city’s lesser-known churches with a bellini at Harry’s Bar – like Truman Capote before them. At every step, runs this line of reasoning, “quality” tourists contribute to the city’s wellbeing through taxes, tips and human interaction.So is the package holiday on the way out? According to a UK trend report by Abta in 2019, people considering their next holiday abroad were looking, above all, to spend less. If the budget holidaymaker is to be given a lukewarm welcome, British tourists have not got the hint.In the past 10 years, the curse of “Venetianisation” – the hollowing out of a place, as it fills with tourist-termites – has beset city after city, as budget airlines and Airbnb have brought a weekend somewhere cobbled within reach of millions. That hasn’t just meant long-established destinations such as Venice or Paris, but sleepy coastal towns such as Porto, on Portugal’s Atlantic coast, that were completely unprepared for the numbers of tourists unleashed on them.The fightback can be dated to July 2015, when the city council in Barcelona – whose famous promenade, La Rambla, had been rendered all but impassable by the sheer number of tourists – introduced a moratorium on new hotels. The following year Airbnb was served a €600,000 fine for listing unlicensed properties – small beer for a company whose revenues from a single quarter have been known to exceed $1bn, but a sign of growing hostility towards an industry that could make a city unrecognisable to its residents in a short space of time.There is, of course, a financial cost to limiting tourism. As Fermín Villar, the president of the Friends of La Rambla, which represents the street’s residential and commercial interests, told the  two years ago, “La Rambla is above all a business … every year more than 100 million people walk along this street. Imagine,” he enthused, “if each person spends only €1.” But mass tourism displaces other businesses, while the exodus of many creative and productive residents, as well as the stress placed on local infrastructure by visitors in such numbers, carry a cost of their own. Da Mosto told me that, in purely economic terms, Venice is a net loser from an industry that has set up shop on its premises and remits much of its revenues elsewhere.A certain nimbleness is required of companies that make money out of tourism but do not want to be seen as blind to its effects. The guide book publisher Fodor’s issues an annual “no list” of destinations that people should altruistically abstain from visiting. This year’s list features Easter Island and the Cambodian temple complex of Angkor Wat. Meanwhile Fodor’s also promotes “twenty-five places to see in the US before you die”. That list includes Big Sur, a stretch of Californian coastline that was recently festooned with a banner reading “Overtourism is killing Big Sur”.Gazing at the distant profile of Mount Kenya from lightly chlorinated water in the African bush might seem like a bearable way to sit out the crisis, but the infinity pool at the Loisaba tented camp, one of three safari lodges in a 23,000-hectare reserve of the same name, hasn’t seen a swimmer in months. Less than a month after flights into the country were suspended on 25 March, Loisaba’s CEO, a Kenyan veteran of bush tourism called Tom Silvester, told me that he had laid off 90 employees, “and with each job around here carrying up to 10 dependents, that’s a big impact”.The damage done by the collapse of Kenya’s tourism industry, which is worth $1.6bn and employs 1.6 million people, is fearsome. After shuttering 24 properties across east Africa, Elewana, the hotel company that operates Loisaba’s three lodges, is drawing on cash reserves to support its 2,000-odd employees and their families. The website of another reserve, the Nashulai, is emblazoned with a plea for donations to combat starvation among the communities that rely on it.While in many places getting rid of tourists may be the only way to restore a healthy natural world, in countries where the tourist industry focuses on the environment, the opposite may be true. When I suggested to Karim Wissanji, Elewana’s CEO, that the best way to conserve Africa’s wildlife might be for human beings to migrate to the cities and leave them in peace, he retorted: “The future of our wildlife and their habitats are intrinsically linked to the future of the safari adventure industry.”Three-quarters of the 2 million foreign tourists who came to Kenya last year came for the wildlife. Were it not for tourism, many of the 160 private reserves that provide vital corridors for migrating animals and excess grazing capacity for the country’s national parks would revert to being hunting grounds or be turned over for agriculture, threatening one of the greatest concentrations of animal life in the world. Competition for grazing land, especially during times of drought, has intensified long-standing conflict between the needs of local communities and the region’s unique wildlife. As Paula Kahumbu, the CEO of conservation organisation Wildlife Direct, wrote in the , “most Kenyan youth see wildlife as irrelevant, something that benefits a few, rich visitors or white landowners”. In the wake of violent incursions on ranches and wildlife parks over the years, safari outfits have looked for ways to make tourism directly support the local population.The loss of incomes caused by the pandemic might yet precipitate disaster. On 21 April, Conservation International, a US charity that protects areas of exceptional bioersity, reported that there has been an “alarming rise in bushmeat and ivory poaching in Kenya”. Loisaba has only been able to maintain its anti-poaching patrols thanks to a donation from The Nature Conservancy, another charity that funds and gives scientific advice for conservation projects around the world.For all the money that foreigners bring to Loisaba, the reserve lacks the ersity of clientele that is an ingredient of the most resilient tourist businesses. Bush tourism in general is attracting too few of Kenya’s growing middle class – while the high cost of living keeps many at home, those who do travel for holidays tend to head for the coast.Now that the country’s borders are shut and rich foreign tourists won’t be back for months, a new conservation strategy will be needed. From an environmental point of view, the immediate peril is that the great apes catch coronavirus. The longer-term challenge is to protect them from a rise in poaching for gorilla meat, and from getting caught in snares laid for antelopes.Covid-19 has exposed the flaw in the model of elite tourism with a conscience. There is no plan B.Among the nations that have, in recent years, tried to build up wildlife tourism is Indonesia, home to the world’s largest lizard, the Komodo dragon. Last year, the government announced a plan to make the town of Labuan Bajo, which is currently the access point for Komodo national park’s numerous islands, into one of 10 major tourism destinations. Ominously, the government scheme is called “10 new Balis”.The idea isn’t to ease pressure on the over-touristed island of Bali, for which a major new airport is planned, but to emulate its success at attracting millions of tourists on cut-price holidays every year. In the process, Bali’s combination of heaving beaches, growing water shortages and mountains of rubbish may also be replicated at the 10 other destinations. “What was once a small fishing village is now supercharged with boom-town zeal and non-stop construction of restaurants and hotels,” reported a CNBC correspondent visiting Labuan Bajo in January.Between 2008 and 2018, the annual number of visitors to Komodo national park increased from 44,000 to 176,000. One big attraction, apart from the nature itself, is the price. After your $50 flight from Bali lands at Labuan Bajo’s new airport, I was told by Glenn Wappett, a former British serviceman who skippers yachts around eastern Indonesia, “you can stay in a hostel and take a day boat to see the dragons and still get change from $100”. That includes the roughly $12 park entry fee. Lonely Planet named the island chain that includes Komodo its “best-value destination” for 2020. (That was before the guidebook publisher was hit by the global lockdown and suspended most of its commercial activities in April.)Indonesia’s preference for mass over elite tourism has been guided by the addition of 2 million young people to the labour market each year. More tourists means more jobs. After all, even if their per-capita outlay is low, large numbers of visitors need more waiters, taxi drivers and marine guides than a handful of extravagant ones.But as visitor numbers to the islands have risen, the dragon population has fallen. Mating practices were disrupted by tourists, while deer poaching depleted their main food source and logging destroyed their habitat. In 2018, Viktor Bungtilu Laiskodat, the governor of the province of East Nusa Tenggara, in which the park lies, advocated increasing the entrance fee to $500 with the aim of attracting richer tourists, reducing visitor numbers and protecting the lizards. In March 2019, after smugglers stole more than 40 Komodo dragons, his administration went a step further and announced that the island of Komodo, home to around 1,700 giant lizards, would close for the whole of 2020 to allow the reptiles, the deer they feed on and their shared habitat, to recuperate.But the governor’s attempts at conserving the region’s main attraction went down badly with many of the locals who make a living from tourism. “There was a huge backlash from e companies, hotels and restaurants,” recalled Wappett. They demanded that tourists be allowed on Komodo, and in October, the national government overruled the governor and the plan was scrapped.The virus is succeeding where the governor of East Nusa Tenggara failed. Entry to the Komodo National Park has been barred to all but the fishing communities that inhabit it. The dragons sup on venison and fish, which, according to Wappett’s friends in the area, have returned in spectacular numbers to these overvisited waters.Still, it’s not hard to imagine what will happen once tourism becomes feasible again. On 14 April, Indonesia’s finance minister predicted that coronavirus, by freezing the tourist trade, could leave as many as 5.2 million Indonesians unemployed. Unless some alternative path for job creation can be found in the future, as soon as flights resume, tourists will be encouraged to return en masse and the dragons will once again come under threat.On 7 May, the UN World Tourism Organisation suggested that the coronavirus crisis would squeeze the industry so hard that progress towards making tourism sustainable – principally by reducing overcrowding and addressing climate change – would be not just halted but reversed. Indeed, since the start of the crisis, airlines and cruise companies have been lobbying hard for tax breaks and the lifting of environmental measures.Destructive though it is, the virus has offered us the opportunity to imagine a different world – one in which we start decarbonising, and staying local. The absence of tourism has forced us to consider ways in which the industry can ersify, indigenise and reduce its dependency on the all-singing, all-dancing carbon disaster that is global aviation.For Komodo in Indonesia the alternative ending involves fewer visitors paying more to visit the national park while the surrounding communities develop the fishing and textile industries that have kept them going for centuries. In Georgia’s Svaneti region, where the lure of tourist dollars has drawn people to abandon animal husbandry in favour of opening guesthouses and cafes, Tsotne Japaridze told me the crisis could be a “lesson not to forget their traditional means of making a living”.More broadly, tourism must be valued not as a quickfire source of foreign exchange, but as an integrated part of a nation’s economy, subject to the same forward planning and cost-benefit analysis as any other sector. In places where tourism is too dominant, it needs to shrink. All this needs to happen in tandem with wider efforts to decarbonise society.As an international industry, tourism means nothing less than the aggregate of activities that range from building airline engines at Rolls-Royce’s plant in Derbyshire to pulling pints in the Irish pub in Montego Bay. From this global perspective, it cannot easily be planned or controlled. Its natural bosses are municipal, provincial and national governments, and it is to these institutions that responsibility for reform now falls. Some have already begun. The council in Barcelona, for example, reclaimed parts of town that had been lost to holiday lets the governor of East Nusa Tenggara tried to price the Komodo Dragon out of danger. Such instincts to tame tourism’s excesses through taxes and pricing need to be adopted everywhere. Tourism isn’t the right that many holidaymakers, whatever their budgets, seem to think it is. It’s a luxury that needs to pay its way. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3940ee2ed9dcc3b356369d49e1260ad983670dab/0_238_5426_3258/master/5426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c630da81f4dc272a842f60a493f90a0","title":"the great review this imperious catherine romp reaches for the tsars elle fanning","story":"Boo to historical accuracy. Hooray to the great comedy cast and script, and watching a ruthless young woman coming up on the inside laneThe Great opens with an asterisk. “The Great,” read the credits, “*an occasionally true story”. It sets the tone admirably. And also acts as a deterrent to all those who thought they might be settling down in front of a new 10-part series by Starzplay devoted to an AJP Taylor-esque exploration of 18th-century Russia and Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst’s rise to power from naive German bridal import to legendary empress Catherine the Great.Instead, this is the story of Empress Catherine (Elle Fanning) for those who found the Helen Mirren thing last year a bit too taxing. And for those who find The Tudors too lacking in jokes and The Borgias just … too bad. In short, most of us.We open in 1761, with aristocratic but impoverished but optimistic but naive young Soph sitting on a swing, regaling her friend with the news that she is soon to be married to Emperor Peter. “Of Russia?” says the friend. In real life, Catherine married the emperor (of Russia) in 1745 and by this point he was a year away from a coup d’etat. But again, if you are someone who already knows this and has been frothing since the beginning of the paragraph, this is not the satirical comedydrama series for you. Go and read a big book, it’s fine.Soon Sophie-known-as-Catherine-because-you-know-what-poshos-are-like is delivered to St Petersburg and Peter. He is played by Nicholas Hoult as Blackadder meets Tom Hulce’s Amadeus, and it’s brilliant. He inspects his blushing bride-to-be fiancee, who hands him a piece of evergreen spruce to symbolise their love. “She’s given me a twig,” he says, concerned, to his advisors. “She’s not another inbred, is she?” Reassured on this point, he resumes courtship. “You’re perfect,” he tells her. “Aristocratic but not powerful or a player. Your family, apparently, are fucked! … You smell funny. Is that usual?” “I’ve been travelling,” ventures his slightly discombobulated fiancee. “Let’s hope it’s that!” he replies, cheerfully, before heading off to hang with his bro-skis.The Archbishop (Adam Godley) tests her religious faith (“How is your relationship with the Lord Our God?” “We’ve had no trouble”) and her hymen and pronounces her fit for purpose. Which, despite Catherine’s love of books, education and all things European and progressive, is to bear heirs (“Let’s hope my seed has found purchase! I must empty myself into you again soon” says Peter, because egomaniacal hedonists are rarely much with the foreplay) and play boules on the lawn with the “cruel and vapid” ladies of the court until Peter’s sack fills again.Gradually Catherine finds a few friends and allies in the house of idiots: Marial (Phoebe Fox, and while I’m here – could we have more Phoebe Fox in our viewing lives, please?), a court lady with a brain but busted down to servant after her father incurred Peter’s wrath, and master strategist General Velementov – the butt of many of the emperor’s brutal practical jokes but whom he keeps around because, as Peter puts it: “He’s good at the thinking part of running the country.” As the mood and marriage darken, they are there to light her way to greatness.It is a romp, with every actor pitch-perfect in their role. Hoult has never been better, Fanning does a fantastic job as the Pollyanna with steel at her core, and Gwilym Lee as cuckolded Grigor Dymov hits his every scene out of the park. The script, adapted by Tony McNamara from his own play, shines – from the rapturous monologue in which Catherine imagines the pleasures of her forthcoming wedding night (“The man caresses you softly … your souls mesh … you fall into a black sky full of stars … end spent and unified!” “Ye-es,” says Marial. “That’s pretty much it”) to the throwaway gags scattered with a liberal hand.The whole is possibly slightly overlong – eight episodes might have done better, especially if they lost some of the more gratuitously violent scenes that occasionally overstep even the broad bounds set by its comic and satirical intentions. But it also offers oblique commentary on the dangers of letting a capricious, narcissistic, bullying man-child rule a nation – to say nothing of the sublime satisfaction of watching someone not just capable coming up on the inside lane but also ruthless enough and sufficiently free of the trappings of modern western democracy to install herself forthwith. I mean, I’m not saying Keir Starmer and Joe Biden should really stage a bilateral coup on both sides of the Atlantic. I’m just saying they could watch this and take a few notes, you know? That would be great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dcd825fd86903c7fbe4283e29055c7c29a91310/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc81c2b8e82e1b43a7797df9826a5b0","title":"himalayan flashpoint could spiral out of control as india and china face off","story":"At least 20 died after soldiers fought with clubs and rocks along the disputed border, making de-escalation hard for the nuclear statesThe forces of two nuclear weapons states have set about each other with clubs and rocks at one of the most forbidding flashpoints in the world, in a bloody incident that highlights the constant dangers posed by expansionist nationalism.India has confirmed that it lost at least 20 of its men in a clash with Chinese soldiers near the disputed mountain border running along the Ladakh area of Kashmir. It is the first fatal confrontation since 1975 and the most serious since 1967, and so can be expected to have a powerful galvanising effect on the populations of both countries, already primed by a constant stream of nationalist rhetoric.There is a long history of such encounters ever since the two nations fought a short war there in 1962. After that conflict a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was declared, but there is no agreed line and limited control, as the events of recent weeks have confirmed. Thus far at least, both Indian and Chinese forces have stuck to an agreement not to carry firearms on patrol near the LAC.Beijing has put out a string of statements blaming India but giving no hint of Chinese casualties, estimated in the Indian press to total 43, including some deaths. In the past, such accounting has come decades later, if at all, from a regime that tightly controls information. For that reason, the only detailed accounts to have emerged so far have come from the Indian press.What is clear is that there will be more of these clashes without a clear change of direction and an attempt to agree on where the LAC should be, and how both sides should behave around it. Both Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping have built their images as warriors for national greatness.In his remarks on Wednesday, Modi warned the sacrifice of the soldiers would not be in vain and that India is capable of giving a “befitting reply” if provoked.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, after speaking to his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, issued his own warning, that India should not underestimate “China’s firm will to safeguard territorial sovereignty”.In the broadest terms the deadly brawl in the Galwan valley was the latest symptom of an increasingly aggressive Chinese policy on territory and borders, of the sort that has been playing out among the rocks and reefs of the South China Sea.Over the decades China has been more assertive than India in building infrastructure around the LAC, with roads and bunkers. In recent years, India has been trying to catch up, in particular with a road to the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), the highest airstrip in the world, with feeder roads leading off it. China has been trying to push back against that Indian construction work, so that its creeping occupation of the Galwan valley goes unchallenged.Since May, Chinese troops appear to have stopped their Indian counterparts from approaching areas where both sides have patrolled over the years. And Beijing has sent in reinforcements. What distinguishes the current confrontation from previous incidents is not just the death toll but the fact that there have been standoffs in multiple locations.“This kind of territory is incredibly hard to hold, but also to move multiple troops over,” said Tanvi Madan, director of the India project at the Brookings Institution. “So it’s not considered to be something that just happened on the ground. It’s clearly a decision made by the Chinese at a more senior level.”It is not just about bragging rights over crags. China has built a road, Highway 219, linking Tibet and Xinjiang, that passes through territory near the LAC that India considers its own. India’s foothold at the DBO airfield, on the other hand, allows its forces to look down at the Karakoram highway linking China and Pakistan.The timing of the incident may be connected to the weather. The melting snows of spring provide an opportunity for aggressive moves. The pandemic may also have played a role. It led to India putting off military exercises, and an extra motive for Beijing to look for distractions from its own failures in governance.The deadly clash happened at a time and a place where officers from both sides were trying to negotiate a disengagement of forces. Neither government wants this to escalate, and the foreign ministers on Wednesday agreed on resuming the disengagement process. But the fact that there has been significant loss of life, at least on the Indian side, makes the situation much harder to defuse.“Now domestic politics and public opinion, especially nationalist pressure to avenge their deaths and escalate, becomes a dangerous force,” Vipin Narang, a security studies professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. “It will be hard for India at least, with a relatively open media, to de-escalate as easily now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97df78339637318a1bc4a2799707668f14f3651/0_37_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd8fa2d22f233f174ad390c4946fe34b","title":"argentina president enters voluntary isolation amid coronavirus surge","story":"The sudden spike in cases has also struck a number of current and former senior politiciansArgentina’s president Alberto Fernández has gone into voluntary isolation amid growing concerns over a surge of coronavirus infections, including several cases among the country’s political elite.The decision to quarantine the president – whose popularity is riding high on his no-nonsense response to the pandemic – was taken due to the “significant increase in the circulation of the virus,” presidential doctor Federico Saavedra said in a statement on Wednesday.Until now, Argentina’s strong coronavirus lockdown, had been a standout success in the containment of the pandemic that is ripping through its South American neighbours Brazil and Chile.But that may start changing after Argentina’s reported cases more than quadrupled in the last month following the gradual lockdown relaxation that began on 10 May.The sudden spike in cases has also struck a number of current and former senior politicians, including former Buenos Aires governor María Eugenia Vidal, 46, a presidential hopeful for the 2023 elections for the opposition PRO party.Fears for the president’s safety were sparked by a lunch Vidal had on Friday with fellow PRO politician and Buenos Aires City mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, who meets regularly with Fernández to coordinate pandemic strategies for Buenos Aires City, with a population of 3 million, and its surrounding Greater Buenos Aires urban area, with a population of 11 million, where nearly all of Argentina’s coronavirus cases are concentrated.Other positive cases Vidal had recently been in contact with include Martín Insaurralde, mayor of the district of Lomas de Zamora in the Greater Buenos Aires area, and Buenos Aires provincial legislator Alex Campbell.Argentina’s reported cases have more than quadrupled from only 8,000 on 17 May to some 35,000 cases now, with almost 16,000 of those cases in Buenos Aires City and another 14,000 in the surrounding Greater Buenos Aires area.The number of nationwide deaths has risen from 373 one month ago to 878 Wednesday.Despite the recent surge in cases, Argentina’s numbers remain far below those of its giant northern neighbour Brazil, the country with the second highest caseload in the world, 923,000, and its western neighbour Chile, ranking ninth worldwide with 221,000 cases. Argentina by comparison ranks 34th in number of cases.President Fernández has already started following his doctor’s order to suspend all “travel and personal meetings” and remain within the walls of the Quinta de Olivos presidential compound in Greater Buenos Aires, cancelling his attendance at the forthcoming national flag day ceremony in the central city of Rosario Friday, a major Argentinian festivity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ecf43ee0f1c8fc7a0532702506a81c97dd63bc/0_64_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9d3c11bf8121793e2b4b9d37ae7d2aad","title":"pandemics destruction nature un who legislation trade green recovery","story":"Experts call for legislation and trade deals worldwide to encourage green recoveryPandemics such as coronavirus are the result of humanity’s destruction of nature, according to leaders at the UN, WHO and WWF International, and the world has been ignoring this stark reality for decades.The illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade as well as the devastation of forests and other wild places were still the driving forces behind the increasing number of diseases leaping from wildlife to humans, the leaders told the .They are calling for a green and healthy recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular by reforming destructive farming and unsustainable diets.WWF’s head in the UK said post-Brexit trade deals that fail to protect nature would leave Britain “complicit in increasing the risk of the next pandemic”.High-level figures have issued a series of warnings since March, with the world’s leading bioersity experts saying even more deadly disease outbreaks are likely in future unless the rampant destruction of the natural world is rapidly halted.Earlier in June, the UN environment chief and a leading economist said Covid-19 was an “SOS signal for the human enterprise” and that current economic thinking did not recognise that human wealth depends on nature’s health.“We have seen many diseases emerge over the years, such as Zika, Aids, Sars and Ebola and they all originated from animal populations under conditions of severe environmental pressures,” said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, head of the UN convention on biological ersity, Maria Neira, the World Health Organization director for environment and health, and Marco Lambertini, head of WWF International, in the  article.With coronavirus, “these outbreaks are manifestations of our dangerously unbalanced relationship with nature”, they said. “They all illustrate that our own destructive behaviour towards nature is endangering our own health – a stark reality we’ve been collectively ignoring for decades.“Worryingly, while Covid-19 has given us yet another reason to protect and preserve nature, we have seen the reverse take place. From the Greater Mekong, to the Amazon and Madagascar, alarming reports have emerged of increased poaching, illegal logging and forest fires, while many countries are engaging in hasty environmental rollbacks and cuts in funding for conservation. This all comes at a time when we need it most.“We must embrace a just, healthy and green recovery and kickstart a wider transformation towards a model that values nature as the foundation for a healthy society. Not doing so, and instead attempting to save money by neglecting environmental protection, health systems, and social safety nets, has already proven to be a false economy. The bill will be paid many times over.”The WWF report concludes the key drivers for diseases that move from wild animals to humans are the destruction of nature, the intensification of agriculture and livestock production, as well as the trading and consumption of high-risk wildlife.The report urges all governments to introduce and enforce laws to eliminate the destruction of nature from supply chains of goods and on the public to make their diets more sustainable.Beef, palm oil and soy are among the commodities frequently linked to deforestation and scientists have said avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way for people to reduce their environmental impact on the planet.Tanya Steele, the head of WWF UK, said the post-Brexit trade deals must protect nature: “We cannot be complicit in increasing the risk of the next pandemic. We need strong legislation and trade deals that stop us importing food that is the result of rampant deforestation or whose production ignores poor welfare and environmental standards in producer countries. The government has a golden opportunity to make transformative, world-leading change happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea83d0e5344cd58810caef54434dca3d6f7de043/0_134_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e66f662007d7d4fe94820b2b4eeb76","title":"uk ministers order urgent vitamin d coronavirus review","story":"Exclusive: emerging evidence studied to see if ‘sunshine nutrient’ could lower Covid-19 riskPublic health officials are urgently reviewing the potential ability of vitamin D to reduce the risk of coronavirus.A delayed Public Health England review into the reasons why BAME people are disproportionately affected, which pointed to historical racism, did not review the role of diet and vitamin D.The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) began this work last month and is considering recent evidence on vitamin D and acute respiratory tract infection in the general population. Evidence will be considered on specific population groups, including those of different ages and BAME groups. In a parallel development, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is conducting a “rapid” evidence review on vitamin D “in the context of Covid-19” with support from Public Health England (PHE).It is understood the reviews will be published in the coming weeks. The Nice review may be used alongside other available information, such as specific patient circumstances, to inform inidual healthcare decisions. Public Health Scotland and NHS boards are also assessing emerging evidence to see whether the so-called sunshine nutrient should be prescribed in hospitals and to high-risk groups to mitigate a second wave of Covid-19.Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, welcomed the reviews and said deaths among BAME NHS staff had brought the question of vitamin D deficiency to the fore.“Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections,” he said. “It boosts the ability of cells to kill and resist viruses and simultaneously dampens down harmful inflammation, which is one of the big problems with Covid.”He is leading a national study collecting information about risk factors for Covid-19 with a focus on vitamin D deficiency to address the absence of research in this area. Any UK resident aged above 16 is eligible to participate.“There are no clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent Covid ongoing anywhere in the world to my knowledge and clinical evidence for its use to reduce risk of acute respiratory infections is mixed,” Martineau added.However, studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation is safe and protects against acute respiratory tract infection. Higher levels of melanin in the skin lead to lower levels of vitamin D creation which are exacerbated in countries which have less sunlight. This can cause immune systems to be weaker.PHE has acknowledged reports about vitamin D potentially reducing the risk of coronavirus but said there was not enough evidence to support this.It has since April recommended all people take 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to maintain bone and muscle health owing to concerns they may not be getting enough sunlight, particularly during the lockdown.UK vitamin D advice is focused on musculoskeletal health conditions such as rickets and there are fears that its effect on general immune systems has been overlooked. On 3 June the Scottish government specifically recommended people from minority ethnic groups with dark skin to take the supplement.Across the UK, as many as 750 NHS staff have received free wellness packs including liposomal vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc from a voluntary initiative called the Frontline Immune Support Team, and there has been some frustration that a more holistic approach to the pandemic has not been implemented.Singapore general hospital reportedly routinely gives coronavirus patients aged over 50 a mix of vitamin D, magnesium and vitamin B12, while countries which have recently had summers have generally been less affected by the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/467586257a2044eadfb27b903fa2d6af73dcd949/0_80_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8adb5fe805414bb925ceb2437c249dc3","title":"china us uighur sanctions pacific aircraft carriers","story":"Washington legislation allows US to freeze assets of Chinese officials it deems responsible for arbitrary detentions in Xinjiang regionBeijing has criticised a new US law that would sanction Chinese officials over the mass incarceration of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, saying it “maliciously attacks” China’s policy in the Xinjiang region.China will “resolutely hit back and the US will bear the burden of all subsequent consequences”, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement after US President Donald Trump signed the Uighur Human Rights Act into law on Wednesday.The statement came after secretary of state Mike Pompeo met with top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii on Wednesday, during which Yang expressed “strong dissatisfaction” with the new law. They also discussed the need for transparency in tackling the coronavirus outbreak and “fully reciprocal dealings”, as the US put it, in terms of commercial, security, and diplomatic ties. The legislation, which passed Congress almost unanimously, requires the US administration to determine which Chinese officials are responsible for the “arbitrary detention, torture and harassment” of Uighurs and other minorities.The United States would then freeze any assets the officials hold in the US and ban their entry into the country.China’s foreign ministry said in a statement that the act “rudely interferes in China’s internal affairs”, and urged the US to “immediately correct its mistakes”.“This so-called act deliberately slanders the human rights situation in Xinjiang and maliciously attacks China’s policy in governing Xinjiang,” the ministry said.Activists say China has rounded up at least one million Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims and is trying to forcibly assimilate them by wiping out their culture and punishing basic Islamic practices.Beijing’s explanation is that it is running vocational educational centres that offer an alternative to Islamic extremism.Trump signed the act just as excerpts emerged from an explosive new book by his former national security advisor John Bolton, who said the president told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that he approved of the vast detention camps.The tensions come amid the US’s simultaneously deployed three of its 11 nuclear aircraft carriers in the Pacific, a military posture seen as signal to China of US military resilience and ongoing commitment to the region.The move also drew swift rebuke from Beijing. The state-run, hawkish tabloid Global Times newspaper, described the US deployment as a “mere show of vanity”, quoting research that argued the US “seems to worry that the outside world is doubting its military capability”.The newspaper warned that “countermeasures” may be taken against US ships, noting that China “possesses aircraft carrier killer weapons”.Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, was quoted as saying: “By massing these aircraft carriers, the US is attempting to demonstrate to the whole region and even the world that it remains the most powerful naval force, as they could enter the South China Sea and threaten Chinese troops on the Xisha and Nansha islands (Paracel and Spratly Islands) as well as vessels passing through nearby waters, so the US could carry out its hegemonic politics.”This is the first time since 2017, when tensions with North Korea were acutely high, that three US aircraft carriers have been in the Pacific: the USS Theodore Roosevelt, back at sea after being sidelined by an outbreak of Covid-19 on board, was patrolling around Guam in the Philippine Sea the USS Nimitz was off the west coast of the US mainland and the USS Ronald Reagan was in the Philippine Sea, south of Japan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0facb0c732d39ca401534fee9322c09ff7898dbd/0_217_2944_1767/master/2944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e599cde286f3b0035d6422191c7ce15","title":"india cautions china against exaggerated and untenable claims in border standoff","story":"Both sides have accused each other of instigating the clash on Himalayan frontier in which at least 20 troops diedIndia on Thursday cautioned China against making “exaggerated and untenable claims” to the Galvan valley area even as both nations tried to end a standoff in the high Himalayan region after their armies engaged in a deadly clash.Twenty Indian troops were killed in the clash on Monday night that was the deadliest conflict between the sides in 45 years. China has not disclosed whether its forces suffered any casualties.Responding to China’s claim to the valley, India’s external affairs ministry spokesman, Anurag Srivastava, said both sides had agreed to handle the situation responsibly. “Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding,” he said in a statement.Both sides have accused each other of instigating the clash between their forces in the valley, part of the disputed Ladakh region along the Himalayan frontier.Media reports said senior army officers of the two sides met on Wednesday to defuse the situation, but there was no confirmation from either side.Indian security forces said neither side fired any shots, instead throwing rocks and trading blows. The Indian soldiers, including a colonel, died of severe injuries and exposure in the area’s sub-zero temperatures, the officials said.The clash escalated a standoff in the disputed region that began in early May, when Indian officials said Chinese soldiers crossed the boundary at three different points, erecting tents and guard posts and ignoring warnings to leave. That triggered shouting matches, stone-throwing and fistfights, much of it replayed on television news channels and social media.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, warned New Delhi not to underestimate Beijing’s determination to safeguard what it considers its sovereign territory. His comments came in a phone call on Wednesday with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.Wang said China demanded that India conduct a thorough investigation and “harshly punish” those responsible.“The Indian side would best not make an incorrect judgment of the situation, would best not underestimate China’s strong determination to safety its sovereign territory,” Wang said in a statement issued by the foreign ministry.He repeated China’s claims that India was solely responsible for the conflict, saying Indian forces had crossed the Line of Actual Control that ides the thousands of troops from both sides deployed in the area.Jaishankar, in turn, accused China of erecting a structure in the Galvan valley, which he called a “premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties,” according to a statement.He added that the incident would have “serious repercussions” on India’s relationship with China, but that both sides were committed to further disengaging on the remote plateau of the Himalayan terrain.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi hailed the soldiers killed in the clashes. “Their sacrifices won’t go to waste,” he said. “For us, the unity and sovereignty of the country is the most important thing. India wants peace, but when provoked, it is capable of giving a fitting reply, be it any kind of situation.”While experts said the two nations were unlikely to head to war, they also believe easing tensions quickly will be difficult.Josep Borrell, a European Union vice president, urged both sides to show restraint and engage in military deescalation.“We express our deep regrets for the casualties incurred and offer our condolences to their loved ones,” the statement said. It called India and China both important partners of the EU and “crucial actors for regional and global stability.”China claims about 90,000 sq km (35,000 square miles) of territory in India’s northeast, while India says China occupies 38,000 sq km (15,000 square miles) of its territory in the Aksai Chin plateau in the Himalayas, a contiguous part of the Ladakh region.India unilaterally declared Ladakh a federal territory while separating it from disputed Kashmir in August 2019. China was among the handful of countries to strongly condemn the move, raising it at international forums including the U.N. Security Council.Thousands of soldiers on both sides have faced off over a month along a remote stretch of the 3,380km (2,100-mile) Line of Actual Control, the border established following a war between India and China in 1962 that resulted in an uneasy truce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddffd522e954f1d834e2f0f680f02bd679bcee56/0_105_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5588911602602ef47fe4a2029396358","title":"lloyds of london and greene king to make slave trade reparations","story":"Firms will make payments to benefit the BAME community and promote ersityTwo major British firms have pledged to make payments to representatives of black people, as well as those of other minority ethnic backgrounds, as they seek to address their founders’ roles in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.The pub chain and brewer Greene King and the insurance market Lloyd’s of London both revealed on Wednesday evening that they would be making the reparations.The news, first reported by the , comes as people outraged by the killing of an African American man in Minnesota, George Floyd, as well as continuing racial discrimination closer to home, demand that the UK recognise the ongoing legacy of the British empire’s extensive role in the enslavement of millions of Africans.Records archived by researchers at University College London (UCL) show that one of Greene King’s founders, Benjamin Greene, held at least 231 human beings in slavery and became an enthusiastic supporter of the practice.When slavery was abolished in the British empire in 1833, the government agreed to pay compensation not to the enslaved people, but to the slaveholders.The records show Greene was given the equivalent of about £500,000 at today’s rate when he surrendered rights to plantations in Montserrat and Saint Kitts.He handed over control of his brewery to his son three years later and it was given its current name after a merger in 1887. Several of Greene’s descendants went on to hold prominent positions in British society, including a Bank of England governor, Conservative MP and BBC director general.“It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s,” said Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive officer on Wednesday.“We don’t have all the answers, so that is why we are taking time to listen and learn from all the voices, including our team members and charity partners as we strengthen our ersity and inclusion work.”MacKenzie added that the firm will “make a substantial investment to benefit the BAME community and support our race ersity in the business”. He added that the firm now employs people “across the UK from all backgrounds”, adding that “racism and discrimination have no place at Greene King”.Lloyd’s of London said it would “invest in positive programmes to attract, retain and develop black and minority ethnic talent”, as well as providing “financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for black and minority ethnic groups”.A spokesman said Lloyd’s was in the process of identifying suitable groups, while Greene King is understood to be consulting on which would be most appropriate. Neither firm was able to say on Wednesday evening how much money they intended to pay in charitable donations or investments in relevant schemes.The UCL records show that Simon Fraser, a founder subscriber member of Lloyd’s, held at least 162 people in slavery and was paid the equivalent of nearly £400,000 at today’s rate for ceding a plantation in Dominica, while yet more were held at a site in British Guiana researchers believe either belonged to him or to his son.“Lloyd’s has a long and rich history dating back over 330 years, but there are some aspects of our history that we are not proud of. In particular, we are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd’s market in the eighteenth and nineteenth century slave trade. This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period,” a spokesman said on Wednesday.The firm said it wanted to both acknowledge its history and identify what it could do to foster a more inclusive culture in the present. Besides the investments, it said it intended to provide education and research, as well as reviewing its “organisational artefacts to ensure that they are explicitly non-racist”.The spokesman added: “We are grateful to our black and minority ethnic colleagues who have helped to shape our conversations and actions to ensure that we create an environment free from injustice for them and for all. Our commitment is that we will continue to listen and learn as we act and to measure our progress.“There is a long way to go but we are determined that we can and will create a culture in the Lloyd’s market in which everybody can flourish.”Records show that, far from a system involving a few wealthy slaveholders, many ordinary Britons benefited directly from fairly small stakes in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, while the country in general grew rich as a result of its proceeds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/683edf92ac46450c29ac144fb039c0bd1b7fba86/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca735d4f63a067999d939ed20d072707","title":"new zealand coronavirus defences under scrutiny as more breaches emerge","story":"Third case flew from Pakistan via Doha and Melbourne, says director general of health as further reports surface of ill-advised birthday parties and funeral gatheringsA fresh coronavirus case has been reported in New Zealand as officials scramble to contain the fallout from Tuesday’s embarrassing quarantine breach and reports emerge of people disappearing after leaving isolation early.Thursday’s case – the third to emerge this week after a 24-day streak of no cases – was a man in his 60s who arrived in Auckland from Pakistan on 13 June on Flight NZ124, transiting through Doha and Melbourne.Officials were contacting all passengers on the flight and have alerted overseas counterparts for the other flights, said Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health. The man was wearing a mask on all flights and was now in a quarantine facility in Auckland, Bloomfield said.It came as police said six people absconded from managed isolation after being granted compassionate leave from Covid-19 quarantine to attend a funeral in Hamilton. And TVNZ reported that a birthday party for a girl in isolation brought people together who should not have been mingling.Bloomfield was forced to apologise on Thursday after initially claiming the sisters behind Tuesday’s new cases had not contacted anyone during their road trip from Wellington to Auckland. It was revealed late on Wednesday that they came into contact with at least two friends who helped them after they got lost on a motorway.The director general said neither of the New Zealand women recalled they had brief physical contact with anyone and so the public health unit did not feel the need to report that. “When I found that out, I followed up,” Bloomfield said. “Yes, the situation has changed, and I’ve been open about that.”“The case of these two women will have upset people, I am certainly upset by it,” he said. “I apologise that we’ve ended up in this position.”Bloomfield wanted to assure New Zealanders that they could trust what he said. The friends of the women have been tested, he added, and one has returned a negative result and the other is waiting for her result.On Tuesday, New Zealand recorded its first new cases of the virus for 24 days after the two New Zealanders, sisters returning after travelling to the UK, were found to be infected. The pair, who were permitted to leave their managed isolation early to visit a dying parent, had not been tested.Since then more reports have emerged. A Christchurch funeral director told Stuff that about 10 people had been let out of quarantine early to attend one of the funerals it had arranged on Tuesday. Steve Parkyn, chief executive of funeral directors Lamb and Hayward, said he refused to let them attend the service after being contacted by health authorities, but they joined mourners at the burial, accompanied by a health official. Around 200 people attended the funeral.Government policy is for everyone in 14-day managed isolation to be tested twice for Covid-19 and to return a negative result before leaving. However, exemptions on compassionate grounds were allowed.Officials are tracing 313 “close contacts”– instead of the previously stated 320 – of the first two cases, which includes hotel workers, guests, health staff and aircrew.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the military would audit and oversee quarantine arrangements.The opposition health spokesperson, Michael Woodhouse, said health minister David Clark should step down for being “completely disengaged from his role”.“If I was the minister this wouldn’t have happened,” Woodhouse said.Winston Peters, the minister of foreign affairs said that a potential trans-Tasman travel bubble had not been jeopardised despite the breaches, because it still dealt with two “Covid-safe states”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/686c9fc7dc38a5e04ad8045654b9598e2c81b6f0/0_287_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d725348ac6dcb12c15f046f7b9bd4620","title":"papua new guinea chiefs call for halt to plan for countrys largest ever mine","story":"Locals say the Sepik river region must be protected from ‘exploitation and destruction from outsiders’Chiefs from 28 haus tambarans – “spirit houses” – representing 78,000 people along Papua New Guinea’s remote Sepik river have formally declared they want a proposal for the country’s largest ever mine halted.PanAust, an Australian-registered miner ultimately owned by the Chinese state-owned Guangdong Rising Assets Management, has proposed building a gold, silver and copper mine on the Frieda river, a tributary to the Sepik.The mine would be the largest in PNG’s history, and one of the largest in the world, covering 16,000 hectares, and is forecast to yield gold, silver and copper worth an estimated US$1.5bn a year for more than 30 years.Haus tambarans are the cultural and political hub of villages in the Sepik region. Pre-colonisation their function was analogous to a local parliament, where debates were held and collective decisions taken. But they also play important roles in spiritual and ancestral connection and in rituals and initiations. In an unprecedented move, the 28 haus tambarans issued a collective Supreme Sukundimi Declaration calling for “a total ban on the Frieda river mine”.It said: “The river is the life of the Sepik and therefore it must be protected at all cost. It is our innate role to guard the river from exploitation and destruction by outsiders. Our future is in peril from this proposed mine and, therefore, we have gathered together as s of the river to stand firm as one.”In its environmental impact statement for the Frieda river mine, PanAust said the “nation-building project … presents broad commercial and socioeconomic development opportunities for Papua New Guinea”.PanAust said it had engaged in “extensive and ongoing engagement … over several decades” with those affected by the mine, running information sessions in nearly 140 villages, attended by more than 18,000 people.“Local opinions and issues have been sought through engagement campaigns … formal and informal meetings with village leaders, and through socioeconomic surveys conducted in villages between 2010 and 2018,” the company said in the statement.The mine plan also includes a hydroelectric plant, power grid, and road, airport and seaport upgrades.In March, campaign group Project Sepik and the Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights (CELCOR) submitted several expert reports to the PNG government’s Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (CEPA), arguing the mine’s environmental impact statement was deficient because it lacked critical information about a tailings dam, analysis on the probability and consequence of a dam break, and settlement plans for displaced villages.Mine campaigner Emmanuel Peni told the  PanAust had not been “honest or transparent” in its consultations with those who live in the Sepik river valley.He said people whose lives and livelihoods depended on the river feared their villages could be permanently damaged or destroyed by the mine, citing the case of Rio Tinto’s Panguna mine, which has left downstream villages with poisoned water, polluted fields and a ruined river valley.“If the dam collapses it will be catastrophic and destroy the Sepik river and our way of life,” he said. “We need to ensure that the Sepik is protected. It is our identity, our life, and the heartbeat of our culture. A life without the Sepik river as we know it would devastate our communities forever.”Peni, from Korogu village on the Sepik River, said the villages felt the need to make the collective declaration – admissible in court – because “they do not trust the government, the police, the army and the outsider who is the owner of the Frieda mine”.Peni said villages along the Frieda and Sepik rivers would seek to halt the mine through legal and legislative channels but would ultimately defend their ancestral lands.“There will be an uprising in the Sepik region and lives will be lost.

Follow the latest updatesGermany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has urged the European Union to reach an agreement €750bn stimulus package by the end of July to help European economy recover from the impact of the pandemic, AFP reports.“It would be best if we could reach an agreement before the summer break,” Merkel said, calling for compromise from member states to enable the deal to be ratified by the end of the year.“We must act quickly and decisively,” she said.The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed the huge fund to help the EU out of its deepest-ever recession, but the plan was immediately met with fierce opposition from fiscally conservative member states including Austria and the Netherlands.The proposed package consists of €500bn in grants and €250bn in loans, but requires unanimous EU approval.“The starting position is far from easy but I hope that all member states will act in a spirit of compromise in the face of this unprecedented situation,” Merkel said.“Cohesion and solidarity have never been more important than today. The crisis can only be overcome if we act for and with each other,” she said.The European Council is due to hold a video summit on 19 June on the controversial stimulus package, the EU’s largest to date.However, a decision is not expected until the leaders have met in person, said Merkel, whose country assumes the EU presidency in July.The German chancellor had in late May stunned observers by proposing along with French President Emmanuel Macron the plan for €500bn in grants to help the hardest hit EU members to get their economies back on track.That proposal, now making up the bulk of von der Leyen’s package, shattered a long-standing German taboo as it included taking on shared debt, a dramatic U-turn after years of obstinate German opposition to joint borrowing.Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former president of Kazakhstan who remains its national leader, has tested positive for coronavirus. At 79, Nazarbayev retains sweeping powers as national leader, chair of the security council and head of the ruling party.“There is no reason for concern,” his spokesman, Aidos Ukibay, said on Twitter. Several members of the Kazakhstan’s government self-isolated earlier this week after the health minister Yelzhan Birtanov and lower house speaker Nurlan Nigmatulin tested positive for Covid-19.Kazakhstan announced a tightening of restrictions for the coming weekend amid fears that outbreak is worsening, according to Reuters. Shopping malls, markets and parks will be closed in big cities on 20-21 June and additional hospital beds will be made available for Covid-19 patients, the government said. It also ordered all provinces to broaden testing for the disease.The spread of the virus has accelerated in the nation of 19 million since it ended a nationwide lockdown last month. Kazakhstan had reported about 23,000 cases as of Friday, with 100 deaths, up from about 5,000 at the end of its lockdown.Afghanistan has announced 42 new Covid-19 deaths, its highest daily toll in an outbreak that has now killed 546 Afghans. The country’s health ministry also announced 658 new cases bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 27,532.The country, which has admitted it has a lack of testing capacity, has tested 61,599 suspected patients since the outbreak began. There have been 7,660 recoveries.Most of the new cases (415) have been reported in the capital, Kabul. It is the country’s worst-affected area so far, with 11,339 cases and 126 deaths.Most of the new deaths reported in the western province of Herat where its laboratory – which is responsible for testing samples of patients in Herat and nearby areas – has halted work due to a lack of kits for Neara week.The health ministry recorded 19 deaths of Covid-19 in the province on Thursday. Herat which borders Iran has so far recorded 4,304 confirmed cases and 108 deaths.Wahid Qatali, the governor of Herat recently said that the actual number of infections may be more than 60,000 in the province. The first case of the virus was reported in the province after thousands of Afghan migrants returned from the neighbouring country in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined.The Afghan health ministry has previously said it was unable to increase testing for coronavirus due to a lack of laboratories and an overload of suspected patients.The UK’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said the case of two women who had reintroduced Covid-19 to New Zealand after travelling to the UK, showed how important it was for people to follow guidelines.The two women infected with Covid-19 were allowed to leave quarantine without being tested and then met up with friends in New Zealand.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Raab said: It shows how careful we need to be, but the travel advice for a while now has been to advise against all but essential global travel. We need to see it applied consistently. Overall, the public have been terrific in following the guidelines. And it gets trickier as you come out of lockdown because the changes are incremental. But we do need to keep following the guidance as we take those careful steps out of the previous regime. The New Zealand officials said the women had “done everything right” after they were released from quarantine, but the New Zealand government is facing questions about why they were not tested before being allowed to leave an Auckland hotel after they arrived from the UK on 7 June. The women had received a compassionate exemption to the compulsory 14-day isolation period for returning travellers in order to visit a dying relative 400 miles (650km) away in Wellington. The compassionate dispensation policy has been suspended.Extensive surveillance measures introduced around the world during the coronavirus outbreak have widened and become entrenched, digital rights experts have said, three months after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic.The measures have often been billed as temporary necessities rushed into place to help track infections, but governments have been accused of denting civil rights with the widespread use of techniques such as phone monitoring, contact tracing apps, and physical surveillance such as CCTV with facial recognition.Top10VPN, a pro-digital privacy website that reviews secure internet connection software, has maintained a database since March of digital and physical surveillance measures implemented to fight the virus.As of Wednesday, it showed digital tracking was in use in 35 countries, with contact tracing apps in at least 28 countries, half of which use GPS location data. Meanwhile, more than half of the apps do not disclose how long users’ data is stored.Three more coronavirus deaths have been announced in El Salvador.Central America’s smallest and most densely populated country has recorded more than 80 deaths from the virus and more than 4,000 cases.In neighbouring Honduras, the president Juan Orlando Hernández, has been admitted to hospital two days after testing positive for the virus.This is Matthew Weaver picking up the global coronavirus live blog from Helen.

Thank for following along.Before I head off, here’s what it is like to be able to go to the pub again (it is even better than the night, early on in lockdown, when I listened to a group of women singing Abba from a nearby apartment while a man across the way yelled “SOCIAL. DISTANCING.” at them from his window, repeatedly):At a video-conferenced summit on Wednesday with leaders of African nations, Chinese president Xi Jinping pledged they would be “among the first” to benefit from a Chinese-developed vaccine.” China will continue to do whatever it can to support Africa’s response to Covid-19,” Xi said, according to an English translation of his speech on Xinhua.“Together, we will build a China-Africa community of health for all. We pledge that once the development and deployment of Covid-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit.”China currently has five vaccine candidates for Covid-19 in human trials, the most in any country. It recently asked for volunteers from among state-owned firms and who were planning to travel, to test candidates in phase three trials.The Chinese government has been pushing hard to build relations with African countries, particularly as its relationships with other nations like the US, UK and Australia, have soured.Beijing’s cluster of new cases may have begun a month earlier than first thought, partly due to asymptomatic infections, according to the director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Amid tight restrictions to stop the spread of the capital’s cluster, which now numbers more than 150 cases, Gao Fu said the outbreak probably did not occur in early June or late May, but probably a month earlier, according to state media.Gao said the volume of asymptomatic cases detected in the outbreak may be partially responsible, but that further investigation was needed.“A lot of asymptomatic or mild cases were detected in this outbreak and that is why the environment has such amount of virus,” said Gao at a seminar in Shanghai on Tuesday.On Thursday, Beijing reported 21 new cases of Covid-19, down slightly from the 31 reported on Wednesday. There were two additional cases in Hebei province that were also linked to the Beijing cluster.The city on Thursday ordered all hotels be shut down, as well as restaurants in high-risk areas. Officials said Beijing was not under lockdown but urged all residents not to travel or gather unnecessarily, and pledged to ensure continued food supply.As always, it would be great to hear from you on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@the – questions, comments, tips and news from your part of the world are most welcome.An interesting initiative here from China Eastern Airlines: Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Thailand on Thursday reported six new coronavirus infections and no new deaths, bringing its total to 3,141 confirmed cases, of which 58 were fatalities.The new cases were quarantined Thais returning from Saudi Arabia and India, said Panprapa Yongtrakul, a spokeswoman for the government’s Covid-19 Administration Centre.Thailand has eased many of its restrictions and has recorded no new local transmissions for 24 days in a row, while 2,997 patients have recovered.India has reported its highest cases in the pandemic so far, with 12,881 confirmed in the last 24 hours, for a total of 366,946 cases. There have been 334 additional deaths, bringing the toll to 12,237. Armies of workers in protective masks are racing to complete the mammoth Dubai Expo 2020 site despite the coronavirus that has sickened some employees, forced a one-year postponement, and created a logistical headache, AFP reports.

It is important to realise that where there is an impact it will not be the same for everyone.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"But a lot of \u0026lsquoheavy lifting\u0026rsquo is being postponed to 2025-2030, according to climatologistChoice for Greens is to take its winnings in the three-party coalition or risk them in pursuit of a \u0026lsquogreener\u0026rsquo prize\u0026lsquoWhat\u0026rsquos happening in Ireland is small cheese compared to somewhere like Brazil\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Avian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Previously, the original HPSC guidance stated that this should be collected for the full group.The guidance says that where at all practical workers in pubs should provide services to only one gathering and should not move between different function rooms.It says toilets should not be used simultaneously by multiple gatherings. Pubs will also be asked to make regular announcements to remind customers to follow social distancing advice and wash their hands regularly and will be asked to place plexiglass barriers at tills and counters.Customers will also have to be seated at a table except when using the toilet, paying and departing.Pubs will be required to serve a “substantial meal” for which it would be reasonable to charge not less than €9. Physical distancing of at least one metre should be maintained between people seated at tables.Pre booking will be encouraged as much as possible and a text may be sent to remind the customer to stay away if unwell.A distance of two metres and a minimum of one metre should be maintained between employees.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The Senior figures in the Green Party say Thursday’s eight-hour online convention involving almost 2,500 members will be crucial in determining the outcome of its vote on entering government.As the deadline for registration closed yesterday, more than 2,400 of the party’s 3,600 members had contacted the party to say they would vote on the programme for government, with postal votes being counted on June 26th.The convention will begin with speeches by leader Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin. The deputy leader’s speech, in particular, will be closely monitored to see if there are any major conditionalities or reservations in her endorsement of the coalition deal.In what was portrayed as a significant boost by Green members campaigning for the coalition, the prominent climate change expert Prof John Sweeney yesterday endorsed the deal saying it had the potential to turn Ireland from a climate change laggard into a leader.Prof Sweeney had raised concerns on Tuesday about references to methane in the document, which was received by some as him opposing the programme.However, in a video message yesterday he clarified his position saying he supported the programme in the round, while disagreeing with some inidual issues.“Pragmatically, this is the best deal we are going to get in the near future and I am supporting it,” he said.While TDs campaigning to adopt the programme for government have said they have received positive feedback, it was accepted that the opposition to the deal is much larger than it was in 2007, when only a handful of members publicly opposed it.“There is certainly a more vocal and organised opposition than there was in 2007,” said Gavin Nugent, the chair of the Young Greens.Party sources said yesterday that the votes of the 800 members based in Northern Ireland could also be critical to the outcome on Friday. Neither the Northern Green organisation, nor its 10n public representatives (two MLAs and eight councillors), has as yet taken a public position on the programme. Northern leader Clare Bailey abstained when a vote was taken by the wider parliamentary party on Monday night, on the basis that she had not had the opportunity to read the document in its entirety.The party needs to get approval from two thirds of its members if it is to enter coalition.‘Jeopardised’The national executive of Young Fine Gael yesterday unanimously voted to instruct its three representatives on the party’s executive council to vote against the deal.In a statement, it said: “It is our members’ view that (the party’s) values and Fine Gael’s distinct identity, will be irreparably jeopardised by entering into a government with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.”Ógra Fianna Fáil yesterday restated its opposition to a coalition with Fine Gael. Its chair, Tom Cahill, it said: “We cannot reconcile the neglect the country has endured under Fine Gael in government. We fought and campaigned hard to remove them from office in this year’s general election.”The Young Greens have yet to adopt a formal position on coalition. Mr Nugent said yesterday it would do so after the party’s special convention.However, Mr Nugent said the preponderance of sentiment among the Young Greens was to vote against.He said the concerns raised by younger members of the party included he lack of costings, timelines and delivery plans. “There is a fear of history repeating itself,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274713.1591714317!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prof denis o sullivan the irishman who shone light on cosmic rays","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Denis O’Sullivan. Analysed moon rocks brought back by Neil Armstrong on board the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Photograph: Eric LukeIf you are resorting to virtual table quizzes to break the Covid-19 lockdown boredom, try this question: who links these three things – moon rocks, high-energy physics and watercolour painting?This is a tricky one unless you knew that an Irish scientist was among the very first in the world to receive and begin analysing the moon rocks brought back by Neil Armstrong on board the Apollo 11 spacecraft.The link in this case is Prof Denis O’Sullivan, a high-energy physicist based at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS). He got his PhD at the institute back in 1966 and was still an emeritus professor at the institute right up to his death on February 27th last.He built a career on the study of cosmic rays, ephemeral but powerful particles that travel at close to light speed and reach us from the sun and sources in deep space. Astronomers speculate about where they come from, for example supernova explosions and other cataclysmic events out at the fringes of the universe.While we don’t know the source, we do see the results in the form of incoming cosmic rays. These are mostly protons but some are much heavier atomic nuclei and because of their speed they are extremely powerful – and potentially damaging.Lucky for the residents of Earth, the planet’s magnetic field channels cosmic rays away towards the poles and almost all the rest are rendered near-harmless by our atmosphere.That is fine for us down at the surface but the higher you go – for example up a mountain or in a commercial aircraft – the higher the radiation exposure. You absorb about one chest X-ray’s worth of radiation in a flight from Dublin to New York. Now move higher still, up to where astronauts orbit. Radiation levels climb with altitude and the flux of cosmic rays increases to the point that they pose a serious safety risk. Beyond the atmosphere there is nothing to protect you in the event of a solar flare.Capture dataIt was in this research area – measuring and studying cosmic rays and developing devices to capture data – that Denis O’Sullivan worked, and at such an advanced level that he became of interest to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). It was moving quickly towards a manned flight to the moon and it wanted to better understand radiation exposures in open space beyond the protections offered by Earth.At this time O’Sullivan was studying ways to use specialised plastics to measure radiation exposure, working with institute colleague Alex Thompson. O’Sullivan temporarily moved on sabbatical to the research lab of P Buford Price at University of California, Berkeley, where similar work was being done. Nasa agreed to support research with Price for the development of detectors and O’Sullivan was a central part of the team.He was there from 1969 through early 1972 and the team developed a device that could measure cosmic radiation. It needed refinement so could not fly on Apollo 11 but versions were carried to the moon fixed to the leg of the moon lander on Apollo 16 and 17. One of the devices brought back from the moon is now on display at the National Museum.This work put O’Sullivan at the forefront of radiation detection and safety and established a research link with Nasa that carried throughout his long career.And what of the watercolours? O’Sullivan took up painting in the 1950s and became an accomplished artist, exhibiting at the royal academies in Dublin, London and Belfast.Denis O’Sullivan (1938-2020). Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anamIn the right place at the right timeDenis O’Sullivan was on research sabbatical at University of California, Berkeley in 1969 a classic case of being at the right place at just the right time. He was in the lab of P Buford Price who had just agreed a research project with Nasa to develop detectors to measure radiation exposures to astronauts. O’Sullivan had been involved in similar work in Dublin and the race was on to develop them.It was an exciting time in the lab but also on the tumultuous Berkeley campus. It had long been a hotbed of protest and dissent and O’Sullivan witnessed student marches, police charges and the arrival of the California National Guard.He had taken up a research position and was there with his wife, Carmel Madden, and children Tanya and Gavin, who were little more than toddlers at that time.The cosmic ray detectors were blocks of a specialised plastic that when struck by a cosmic ray particle would excavate a telltale track in the block. The more particles colliding with the detectors, the more tracks and the more information. It was not simply a counting operation the tracks provided a wealth of data that helped to identify the particle causing the track.O’Sullivan had also studied whether cosmic ray tracks could be trapped by other materials and this opened up the possibility of searching for tracks left behind in moon rocks.The rocks brought back from the moon in question arrived early in 1970 and O’Sullivan was in the midst of it with Price and his team looking for cosmic rays from the sun, and O’Sullivan looking for cosmic rays from deep space.

Photograph: Andrew Parsons10 Downing StreetAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union is preparing to redouble efforts and work through the summer to hammer out a deal with Britain following a meeting between prime minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders on Monday.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, held a video conference with the British leader to take stock of the lack of progress in the talks, with just six months remaining before barriers to trade between Britain and its neighbours make an abrupt return, after decades spent removing them.The political leadership on both sides sent the message to their negotiators to go back over the areas where they had encountered stumbling blocks and try again to see if they can inch their way to a compromise that would avoid the most drastic ‘no trade deal’ option.“We agreed . . . that new momentum was required,” Ms von der Leyen said following the meeting.The mood in Brussels was upbeat towards the prospects of reaching a deal following the meeting, with those working close to the negotiations expecting a summer of late-night marathon talks that would likely run through the traditional holiday period.\u0026nbspBritain had initially briefed that it would abandon attempts to find a deal at this stage if it felt insufficient progress had been made, and focus its work instead on preparing for an automatic switch from January 1st to World Trade Organisation terms – a global default system of tariffs expected to cause a significant blow to trade.London’s shift away from this position and commitment to the talks has been taken as an indication that a deal can be found.Joint statementIn a joint statement following the meeting, both sides committed to “create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020”.“The parties underlined their intention to work hard to deliver a relationship which would work in the interests of the citizens of the union and of the United Kingdom, ” the joint statement read. “They also confirmed their commitment to the full and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement.”The two sides have agreed to six rounds of negotiations between June 29th and August 21st, held physically if possible and alternating between London and Brussels. Since February, negotiations have been over video conference because of the pandemic, ruling out informal side chats that often help find common ground.Sticking points include fishing rights and fair competition provisions for business.On policing and security co-operation, a way through could be possible, as the EU is open to workarounds through the international policing co-operation body Interpol. However, this would be a far more distant kind of co-operation than once hoped for.The British side has bridled at insistence by the EU that the deal should contain a commitment to uphold the Paris Climate Accord, insisting that this goes far beyond the stipulations of past trade deals. But in the EU’s view, modern-day trade deals have evolved to include such commitments, and they are appropriate because Britain is a like-minded country that has signed up to the agreement anyway.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Stephane LemoutonAFPIreland has won a seat on the UN Security Council, in a major boost for the country’s foreign policy credentials.Ireland secured 128 votes – exactly the two-thirds majority needed to qualify – in a vote at UN headquarters in New York on Wednesday.Norway was also elected in the first round, securing 130 votes. In a blow to Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, Canada failed to win a seat – the second time it has lost a bid over the last decade.Ireland’s two-year term on the 15-member council will begin in January and will mark the fourth time the country has held a seat on the influential international body.Ireland’s ambassador to the United Nations, Geraldine Byrne Nason, had been leading efforts to secure a seat on the council in New York, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney liaised with countries across the globe in an effort to drum up support for Ireland’s bid.At a press conference in Government Buildings, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste both said Ireland had “punched above its weight”.Tough electionMr Varadkar said it had been a “tough election” and the contest against Canada and Norway made it the “group of death”.“We are a small country that has a big presence and is a force of good,” he said. He said the fact that Ireland was the only member of the EU vying for the position was a factor, as was our relationship with African and island states and the work done by the Irish Defence Forces in the UN.“For a small country, we have a lot of influence,” said Mr Coveney, adding that the result showed a lot of countries respected the good standing that Ireland has had.Both said the €800,000 spent on the campaign was justified, and noted it was half that spent by Norway and Canada.“It was money well spent to ensure that Irish values and Irish foreign policy is shaping global decision-making for the next two years,” said Mr Coveney.While Norway had been expected to be elected in the first round, Ireland’s qualification in the first round of voting was particularly noteworthy. Voting had been expected to stretch into a second round on Thursday.Ireland’s track record on foreign development aid, its history as a colonised country and affinity with other small nations, as well as its commitment to UN peacekeeping, are likely to have persuaded its fellow UN members to support the bid.Peace processIn addition, Ireland was the only country in its group that is a member of the European Union. Its stance on the Middle East peace process and support for the two-state solution is also likely to have sat well with Arab nations.President Michael D Higgins, who hosted several events during the UN General Assembly in New York last September to highlight Ireland’s international credentials and track record on climate change and poverty reduction, congratulated those involved in the bid, noting that the campaign “engaged with global issues, such as peace-building and peacekeeping, the elimination of global poverty, the strengthening of multilateralism, and reform of the United Nations.”Former US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, who was born in Ireland, was among those who congratulated Ireland on its campaign.Goal’s chief executive, Siobhan Walsh, said the result “both speaks to our ambition as a nation to meaningfully contribute to the global community, while representing an acknowledgement by other nations of Ireland’s unique offering to the world”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

This is what they intend to convey to the Independent Commission of Inquiry.“Both of these decisions were reached after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection, and with the full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world.”The statement came after the majority of both undergraduates and postgraduates studying at Oriel had this week voted in favour of the statue being removed. Carole Souter CBE, the current master of St Cross College and former chief executive of the National Lottery Heritage Fund, was immediately appointed as the independent chairman of the inquiry - which it said would continue “at pace” and report back by the end of the year.As well as dealing with “the issue of the Rhodes legacy”, the inquiry will also explore “how to improve access and attendance of BAME undergraduate, graduate students and faculty, together with a review of how the College’s 21st Century commitment to ersity can sit more easily with its past”.The statement added that the inquiry would “approach a number of  iniduals drawn from the worlds of academia, education policy, law, politics and journalism, adding:  “The commission is intending to draw upon the greatest possible breadth and depth of experience, opinion and background.”It said written and oral evidence will be taken from a broad range of stakeholders from Oxford and the country, including students, representatives of Rhodes Must Fall and Oxford city council, as well as alumni of Oxford and Oriel and citizens of the city.“The Governing Body believes that this decision will allow a serious, appropriate and productive resolution of a complex series of issues,” the statement added. The statement came after Oriel’s Governing body met for several hours on Wednesday afternoon amid rising tensions in Oxford following the recent Black Lives Matter protests. Students have been writing dozens of letters to vice-chancellor Prof Louise Richardson and College heads demanding that institutional racism be tackled. On Wednesday, Prof Richardson was criticised by 14 of her university’s own professors who accused her of making “unwarranted claims” about Nelson Mandela after she quoted the former President of South Africa as saying: “Hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment.”Writing for the , the dons warned Prof Richardson that she should not “presume to speak for black students or people of colour”, saying it was inappropriate for her to “ventriloquise” the late anti-apartheid leader. Prof Richardson hinted that Mr Mandela might not support the Rhodes Must Fall campaign because “he was a man of deep nuance who recognised complex problems for what they were.” Pointing to a speech given by Mr Mandela in 2003 to launch the Mandela Rhodes Foundation, a partnership with the Rhodes Trust to offer scholarships to African students, she said: “He said that we have to acknowledge our past but focus on the future.”The letter was signed by Oxford academics including Robert Gildea, a professor of modern history, Elleke Boehmer, a professor of world literature and Miles Trendi, an associate professor in African politics and Faisal Devji, a professor of India history. A separate open letter was sent to the vice-chancellor this week from the university’s black and ethnic minority staff network, which accused her of “limited and inadequate” messages to staff about countering institutional racism. On Wednesday, Oriel students Neil Misra and Swaraj Dash, who continued the Rhodes Must Fall campaign that started in 2015, told the : We are absolutely delighted. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"companies britain linked slave trade say today","story":"Greene received nearly £500,000 in today\u0027s money when he surrendered rights to three plantations in the West Indies.There is also evidence that other partners of RBSG predecessors may have been part owners of ships involved in slave trading voyages during the 18th and 19th centuries.Layla Moran, a challenger for the Liberal Democrat leadership, said she would be writing to the bosses of companies highlighted in the UCL database, urging them to make donations to BAME causes.How Greene King is linked to the slave trade:How RBS is linked to the slave trade:How Lloyds Banking Group is linked to the slave trade:How RSA Insurance is linked to the slave trade:How Lloyd\u0027s of London is linked to the slave trade:What Lloyd\u0027s of London says today:How P\u0026ampO is linked to the slave trade:How Danske Bank is linked to the slave trade:How Barclays is linked to the slave trade:How HSBC is linked to the slave trade:More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive british companies made money slavery abolished","story":"Over the following years, Greene became an enthusiastic advocate of slavery. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he threw himself \u0027with enormous vigour into representing the interests of the West Indian slave proprietors at a critical juncture of their affairs\u0027.Greene handed control of his Suffolk brewery to his son Edward in 1836, and it was renamed Greene King after merging with Frederick King\u0027s nearby brewery in 1887.Yet on the page of the company\u0027s website devoted to its 200 years of rich heritage, no mention is made of Benjamin Greene\u0027s slaving past.He said: It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s.We don\u0027t have all the answers, so that is why we are taking time to listen and learn from all the voices, including our team members and charity partners, as we strengthen our ersity and inclusion work.James Cheyne, a director of the National Bank of Scotland, which later became part of RBS, received a share of three claims over estates in Tobago, worth £375,141 today.In 2006, RBS\u0027s US arm, Citizens and Charter One, pledged $5 million to support local economic and educational initiatives for African-American communities. A further $2 million will pay for scholarships for African-Americans over the next four years.On Wednesday, a spokesman said RBS has looked into its past links with slavery very extensively and thoroughly over the past 15 years.Eight former companies associated with Lloyds Banking Group also have links to claimants or beneficiaries in the UCL database.His son-in law, Sir Anthony Lechmere, was awarded compensation for 286 enslaved people in the Virgin Islands, totalling £489,985 in today\u0027s money, and was an investor in the bank.A Lloyds spokesman said: Like any institution that is so interwoven with our country\u0027s history, we must acknowledge and learn from our past.One of them – William Tetlow Hibbert, who founded the bank in 1839 – was paid £4.5 million in today\u0027s money for compensation over nine claims relations to estates in Jamaica, two as a mortgagee.A Barclays spokesman said: The history of Barclays, like other institutions, is being examined following recent events. We can\u0027t change what\u0027s gone before us, only how we go forward.HSBC is linked to the compensation scheme through George Pollard, the first manager of London Joint Stock Bank, which was later absorbed by Midland Bank and eventually merged into HSBC.Danske Bank said it had a zero-tolerance policy against all forms of discrimination, disrespectful behaviour, bullying, and harassment of any kind.Insurer Lloyd\u0027s of London, with founder subscriber Simon Fraser, was the former owner of the Castle Bruce estate in Dominica, which was handed compensation totalling £397,451 in today\u0027s money.We will provide financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for black and minority ethnic groups.Modern-day insurance giant RSA Insurance also has links through the database through five company directors and a governor of London Assurance – which was merged into Sun Insurance in 1959 and eventually RSA Insurance in 2008 – who received money from the database.An RSA spokesman said: There are aspects of that history that don\u0027t reflect the values we hold today.Shipping company P\u0026ampO, now owned by DP World, can also trace its routes to slavery in the database through Joseph Christopher Ewart, who later became a director of P\u0026ampO Steam Navigation Co and received £334,336.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government finished paying uks slavery debt 2015","story":"The huge debt, named the Slavery Abolition Act (1835) Loan, ultimately became an undated gilt which could not be repaid until 1957.In a Freedom of Information response in 2018, HM Treasury said: Money borrowed to fund the Slavery Abolition Act (1835) was fully repaid in 2015.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meant conservative government finally acting like one","story":"Is Theresa May still in charge? Has Sir Keir Starmer suddenly become Prime Minister? What’s happened to the ebullient, optimistic, can-do Boris? These were the questions that even the Prime Minister’s greatest fans had started to ask after the drift, chaos and lack of direction of the past few weeks.With Boris Johnson almost invisible, the Government felt rudderless, bogged down in detail, strangely unable to lead us out of lockdown, excessively risk-averse and in hock to discredited “experts”. It gave the impression of being blase about the calamitous economic, educational and welfarist cultural consequences of the never-ending lockdown and insufficiently self-confident to be able to admit publicly that the state apparatus had failed.Then came the hijacking of the anti-racist protests, the traducing of a heartfelt movement decrying the despicable murder of George Floyd in America, the lawlessness, the hard-Left and hard-Right protests, the smack of cultural revolution, the orgy of officially-sanctioned wokeness.Where was Boris? Wasn’t this meant to be a conservative, patriotic and competent government? Why was Churchill’s statue boarded up, and the mob allowed to tear down or deface with impunity in what purports to be a law-governed democracy? Where was the modern, anti-racist, pro-meritocracy, conservative side of the argument, the alternative narrative that Boris ought to have been so great at delivering?Priti Patel and others did a great job putting that argument, but it felt piecemeal. The void from the centre was mystifying. It was as if the virus had blown the Government up, that it was still suffering from shell-shock, its confidence shot to pieces by the death toll, its ability to readjust to a new political landscape severely impaired.Some of this was unfair: No 10 has been forced to micromanage much of the fight against Covid as a result of the failure of our nationalised health establishment. Massive improvements have been quietly pushed through. Johnson was exhausted: the coronavirus is exceptionally draining and damaging, and its victims take ages to recover fully. But political warfare isn’t fair, and the Government made unforced errors, not least in imposing a quarantine even on countries that have defeated the virus. Its inability to reopen schools has proved especially debilitating, as has its obsession with a two-metre rule that isn’t followed in nations that have reopened without a second wave.Yes, the Government is right to be worried: Covid is a terrible threat, and the number of cases is shooting up again in the US and elsewhere. But the only way forward is to reopen regardless, as France, Spain and Italy have done, to shift the narrative towards one of co-existence with a contained virus, to hope that new drugs and vaccines are arriving soon, to tell the public that they can go back to work, to put in place genuinely mass testing and tracing systems. We cannot lock down forever and we cannot afford to lock down again.The drift of the past two months has allowed the Left-wing establishment to reassert itself. The BBC has appointed one of its own as its new boss an ex-Treasury, ex-IMF, Left-wing think tanker was appointed as head of the Office for Budget Responsibility the CBI’s new boss used to advise Gordon Brown and work for the . The only economic policy we heard about – apart from the necessary spending of hundreds of billions to cushion the economy – were “green jobs”, state-infrastructure, government this and government that. The Left-liberal elites were beginning to hope again that Boris’ project was about to fail. The EU detected weakness, crashing the talks before seeking to prolong the transition.Yet with luck all of this is now history. The Government has finally launched its comeback, to the great relief of its base. It is holding firm on Brexit and reinjecting energy into the talks. Johnson sounds like himself his mojo is returning. The first real signs of this fightback came on Sunday, with the revelation of a crackdown against those defacing war monuments. We were also reminded that May’s gender-identifying reform plans would be ditched.Then Johnson wrote one of his classic, barnstorming articles for this newspaper. The new equalities commission, set up by the brilliant Munira Mirza, suggests an innovative, authentically liberal-conservative and anti-Marxist approach to tackling entrenched inequalities, racism and poverty. Kemi Badenoch, another Tory star who deserves to be promoted to the cabinet at the next reshuffle, will be leading the group. The significance of this endeavour and the excellence of the personnel selected for it cannot be underplayed.Next came the abolition of the Department for International Development, and its absorption into the Foreign Office. Australia and others have long since pushed through such a sensible reform, which will reduce waste, junkets and ineffective, counterproductive spending, and allow a unified foreign policy. It’s a great step in the right direction: the useless aid-industrial complex hates it.There have still been some missteps such as the fiasco over free school meals. It was never a battle worth fighting and should have been nipped in the bud. But the trend is hugely positive: Johnson was on his old form at PMQs, trouncing Starmer over the latter’s refusal to accept that it’s safe for children to return to school. His language is Johnsonian again: “A great ox has stood on your tongue”, he said of Starmer the aid reforms end “the great cashpoint in the sky”.Which takes us to the virus: Boris’s relaunch must extend to shaking-up the Government’s frightened approach. He needs to tell his Johnsonian stories again. Scientists can no longer be used as human shields. All schools will open fully in September, with no social distancing. He must ditch the two-metre rule immediately. Above all, he must display leadership, passion and optimism, dragging Britain back to quasi-normality.His language has shifted the signs are promising. But a PM elected with such support and promise can no longer allow his Government to falter. The next 12 months will determine his fate and legacy: the old Boris has returned, and the country cannot allow him to disappear again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden surprisingly slow achieving herd immunity study finds","story":"Sweden’s state epidemiologist has said the country has been “surprisingly slow” at achieving herd immunity.The death toll in Sweden passed 5,000 on Wednesday and the Scandinavian nation has one of the highest mortality rates in the world at 487 per 1m population, approximately ten times higher than neighbouring Norway.Yet an analysis by Werlabs AB of 50,000 tests showed that only 14 per cent of those living in the Stockholm region tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. In Bergamo, considered to be the epicentre of Italy’s deadly outbreak, about 57 per cent of people had antibodies.

There had been expectations that this policy choice would have allowed Sweden to achieve herd immunity without imposing an economically and socially crippling lockdown.However, in an interview with Swedish Radio, Anders Tegnell, Sweden\u0027s chief epidemiologist, admitted that immunity rates were low and that “it’s difficult to explain why this is so.”Mr Tegnell and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven have long defended their softer approach to lockdown, stating the disease is not something that can be defeated with a short term fix but that nation’s must learn to live with the virus.A minute’s silence was observed in the country’s parliament to honour the 5,000 people who lost their lives.Andres Norlen, the parliamentary speaker, said “parliament is mourning.

It did so using an experiment known as XENON1T, which was located deep underground in Italy.Seeing evidence of dark matter would be one of the biggest possible breakthroughs in science. Though it is though to make up 85 per cent of the matter in the universe, it has never been detected directly.Scientists see the \u0027rarest event ever recorded\u0027The XENON1T experiment aimed to find them by filling a detector with 3.2 tonnes of ultra-pure liquefied xenon, a chemical element. If a particle passes through that xenon, it creates a tiny flash of light – since most of those interactions occur from particles that are known to exist, scientists are able to predict how many there will be, and any excess ones would be evidence of some unexpected physics.Scientists expected to find 232 such events as they looked through the data from the experiment. But in addition to those they found a surprising excess of 53 events, which would not have been predicted in the data.There is no definitive answer to the question of where those flashes are coming from. But some of the leading explanations could offer a new insight into some of the most profound question of physics.The flashes could for instance be the result of the existence of a new particle, the scientists say. The excess events is roughly in line with those expected to be seen from hypothetical particles known as axions, which can be produced in the Sun.Solar axions are not dark matter candidates, and their discovery would not be evidence that it exists. But it would be the first time that scientist have ever detected this class of new particles, and finding them could lead to new discoveries about fundamental physics as well as astrophysical phenomena, they say.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

There is a roughly one in 5,000 chance that the results would be a random fluctuation rather than lining up with this hypothesis – but other explanations are similarly statistically significant, the researchers say.Otherwise, the excess events could be the result of neutrinos, trillions of which are passing through us and everything around us ever second. The result could be an indication that our understanding of the characteristics of those particles is wrong, a discovery that may require new physics to be explained.Perhaps the most pedestrian explanation would be an unexpected new kind of background noise, caused by the detector having more of an isotope known as tritium inside than expected. It would only need a tiny number of such atoms to be present in the detector to explain the excess – but such an amount would also be so small that it is not possible to detect whether it is there or not.Scientists are currently upgrading the XENON1T experiment to its next phase, known as XENONnT. That will have a much larger amount of active xenon in its detector, as well as a lower background, allowing for cleaner data.Researchers hope that future work can help explain whether the unexpected events are coming from a contaminant in the detector, a statistical fluke – or a particle or behaviour that has never before been detected, or even explained by current physics.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Theroux said he attended a QPR game in 2001, and was told to watch out for Crouch, the “ungainly” but “very useful” new striker. While in the box for the match, he encountered Banksy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“This is the random part of this,” he said. ”One of the other people in the box was a young artist. He was a little bit sheepish, he wasn’t terribly outgoing, and I said, ‘What do you do?’“He said, ‘I’m a street artist,’ and he gave me a little booklet of his art, and I looked at it and it looked quite good and I kind of made awkward chit-chat, and I said, ‘Oh, what’s your name?’ and he said, ‘Banksy.’”Amy Levy was a queer Jewish writer shunned by Victorian societyPee Wee Ellis: ‘America was built on slavery – but change is coming’Theroux continued: “Fast-forward a year, and people kept going, ‘Have you heard of this bloke Banksy? No-one knows who he is.’ And I said, ‘Banksy? Yeah, I know who he is – we went to a QPR game together!’”Banksy is known for keeping his identity a secret to this day, the artist’s real name has never been confirmed.“I couldn’t really remember anything about the encounter,” said Theroux, “but just the fact of having met Banksy at this random thing has stood me in good stead the last 20 years.

At its maximum point of total eclipse, the Moon will block approximately 99.4 per cent of the Sun, though this will only last for a fraction of a second.Nasa has mapped the trajectory of the annular solar eclipse, which sees its path pass over the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, Oman, Pakistan, India, Nepal, China, Taiwan and Guam.The eclipse will not be visible for people in the southern hemisphere, nor in more northerly latitudes like the UK. It will also be impossible to view from North America, while travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic mean that people will be unable to fly to locations where it will be visible.For those unable to see it in person, Timeanddate will be hosting a live stream of the eclipse on its website.Created with Sketch.

Though they must come from some very extreme, intense part of the universe, there is no way of knowing what process gives rise to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe first FRB was picked up in 2007 and scientists have gone on to find more than 100 since. Initially, they were detected only as inidual blasts, but in recent times researchers have found repeating sources.Now astronomers have started to find bursts repeating in a pattern, where they seem to switch off and on in a predictable pattern.Scientists find exact location of radio blasts coming from spaceThe latest discovery sends out random bursts of radio waves over a four-day window, and then goes quiet for 12 days, before beginning again.Researchers watched the bursts for more than 500 days, noting that the 16-day pattern occurred consistently over that time, making it the most definitive pattern yet seen.“This FRB we’re reporting now is like clockwork,” says Kiyoshi Masui, assistant professor of physics in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.“It’s the most definitive pattern we’ve seen from one of these sources. And it’s a big clue that we can use to start hunting down the physics of what’s causing these bright flashes, which nobody really understands.”The discovery is reported in a new article, titled \u0027Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source\u0027, published in Nature today.The latest FRBs were picked up by CHIME, a radio telescope in British Columbia that began its work in 2017. Since then, it quickly started picking up FRBs, using a technique that allows it to stare at the entire sky rather than moving around if and when any burst is detected.The repeating nature of the burst could give new insight into where they are coming from.Possibilities include one single object such as a neutron star that is spinning and wobbling in space. That could explain the pattern to the blasts, since the 16-day period may be the time it takes for the object to spin around, with the four days of activity the ones in which it is pointing towards us.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pattern could be the result of the orbit between , and the interaction between the two objects, which would explain their regular pattern, scientists say.Another involves a static radio source that is going around a central star – that star could be letting out a cloud of gas that magnify the radio emissions and send them powerfully towards Earth. The repeating pattern could therefore be an indication of when that source travels through its clouds.The CHIME telescope works to keep exploring FRB, measuring one roughly each day. It will also keep watching the newly discovered burst, and any changes in its properties could offer an important hint about where it is coming from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial.

They also expect the overall welfare of the UK of the population to be slightly lower as a result of the deal. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA trade agreement with New Zealand could have limited effects on UK GDP in the long run, with the estimated impact on GDP being close to zero under both scenarios compared to the UK not having a trade deal with New Zealand (between 0.00 per cent and 0.01 per cent in scenario 1 and -0.01 per cent and 0.00 per cent in scenario 2), the document says.However the trade deal would be slightly more beneficial to New Zealand itself, the government found, noting that GDP in New Zealand is estimated to see economic growth of 0.14 per cent or 0.35 per cent as a result of this FTA in scenario 1 and 2, respectively.UK and EU agree to intensify trade talks as Brexit deadline loomsExtend Brexit transition period to save stalling trade talks, EU urgesWhile the government expects a trade deal to slightly increase productivity and gross value added, its modelling also warns that not all areas of the country would benefit.In Northern Ireland, output may decrease relative to the baseline, reflecting a higher concentration of the agriculture and semi-processed food sectors, the document says. Exports to New Zealand are expected to increase by between 3.8 per cent and 7.3 per cent under the deal. The government expects there to be a significant increase in imports of New Zealand lamb coming to Britain.Overall the government projects that a substantial deal will reduce the welfare of the population. The document says: Headline welfare changes are limited under scenario 1 and are estimated to decrease by 0.01 per cent in scenario 2.Despite the potential damage to the UK economy from the deal, negotiations were formally launched on Wednesday, alongside talks with Australia.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK economy shrank by 20 per cent in April alone on the back of the coronavirus crisis.The government also admitted in March that its flagship trade deal with Donald Trump\u0027s United States would boost UK GDP by 0.16 per cent. However, the government is keen to sign trade deals with other countries to illustrate the benefits of leaving the European Union\u0027s customs union, in which Britain could not sign its own agreements but benefits from collective deals negotiated by the EU. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: Today\u0027s launch of trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand is a historic moment for this county.When we left the EU we did so on the promise of trading more with friends and allies across the world. Deals with Australia and New Zealand are a powerful expression of our newfound independence and our intent to build a global Britain.

The businesses I speak to around the country simply cannot understand why the government is spending so much time and effort trying to negotiate international trade deals of relatively low value when it is yet to secure our continued trade with Europe. When the 47 per cent of our trade that depends on Europe is still hanging on the balance then that is where the government\u0027s priority should lie.Speaking at the Commons international trade committee on Wednesday, Nick von Westenholz director of EU exit at the National Farmers\u0027 Union said: There is a huge market of 450m consumers on our doorstep in very close proximity so it will remain hugely important market for us. Absolutely we should look for trade opportunities elsewhere around the world in the years ahead but none of those even collectively will make up for the significant damage agriculture might experience if we have a very hard end of the transition period next year. Absolutely the EU negotiation would be our priority.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

China ‘should take a step back’ on Hong Kong, Dominic Raab says“What you’re seeing with the merger is that we want to bring our world-beating aid budget and development expertise we’ve got in DfID right to the beating heart of foreign policy decision making and give not just taxpayers benefit but that have the maximum impact they need at this crucial time,” he said. “So I do think we are learning lessons from the crisis and trying to turn that into the kind of innovation which will sharpen our cutting edge in terms of foreign policy.” Addressing the issue of statues in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, the foreign secretary also told Radio 4’s Today programme that the UK should be careful not to “airbrush” its history, but should “update it”. “One thing I do accept is that people will think that we ought to keep updating our history, and make sure the symbols reflect the spirit and the values of the age,” he added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A statue of Christopher Columbus will be removed from California‘s state capitol, amid a growing campaign to take down monuments of the Italian explorer.The statue, which also features Queen Isabella of Castile, who sponsored Columbus’ voyage in 1492, currently stands in the rotunda of the capitol in Sacramento and is titled “Columbus’ Last Appeal to Queen Isabella.”It has stood there since 1883, when it was gifted to the state.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, in a joint statement the legislative leadership in California claimed that the statue is now “completely out of place.”The statement was a combined effort from Senate president pro tempore Toni G Atkins, assembly speaker Anthony Rendon and Assembly Rules Committee chair Ken Cooley.Christopher Columbus statue set alight, thrown in lake by protesters“Christopher Columbus is a deeply polarizing historical figure given the deadly impact his arrival in this hemisphere had on indigenous populations,” the statement read.“The continued presence of this statue in California’s Capitol, where it has been since 1883, is completely out of place today. It will be removed.The decision was praised by California assemblywoman Lorena Gonzales, who also serves as the head of the Latino Caucus.“It’s important that children today learn the difference between real heroes and fake ones,” Ms Gonzales tweeted.The announcement by the leadership comes after statues of Columbus have been taken down across the US, in response to protests around racial injustice.Monuments to Confederate officials have also been removed in numerous states in the past couple of weeks, and House speaker, Nancy Pelosi has called for 11 monuments to be removed from the US Capitol.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A coronavirus vaccine will only be successful if black participants are included in clinical trials, experts have warned.Medical experts have expressed fear that black people are not being proportionately represented in Covid-19 trials and have said that their participation is critical.Researchers stress that medicine could produce different results based on race and genetic, socioeconomic and environmental dynamics, and need to be accounted for during clinical trials.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Genetics related to racial differences make it essential that we be involved in broad-based and erse clinical trials of medications and vaccines,” Dr Larry Graham, a retired pulmonologist, told NBC News.“The expanding discipline of pharmacogenetics has taught us that we may respond differently than other races to both medicines and vaccines. We must be sure it works in black folks. This can only be determined by our inclusion in the research-based trials of such vaccines.”Black reporter sues newspaper for prohibiting coverage of BLM protestsHow to volunteer for human coronavirus vaccine trials Vaccine might be ready in first half of 2021, says Imperial professorPharmacogenetics is the study of how people respond differently to drug therapy based upon their genetic makeup or genes.Data has emerged throughout the pandemic showing that African Americans are being disproportionately affected by the virus, both in terms of infections and deaths.Experts say there are several reasons for this including a number of socio-economic factors such as limited access to healthcare.“Over the last couple of decades we’ve seen conservative forces destroying the social safety net. And it’s meant black communities and brown communities and indigenous communities, have pre-existing conditions that make iniduals more susceptible to the worst ravages of Covid-19,” Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a group that works to promote the political power of women of colour, said.“Those pre-existing conditions are caused by socio-economic factors. You can’t shelter in place if you don’t have shelter.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For the 40-year study, 399 syphilis infected black men were enlisted to the trial and offered free medical exams, free meals, and burial insurance.The men were not given any effective treatment, only placebos, and 28 of the men died of syphilis while 100 died of related complications. A number of the wives and children of the men were also infected.Calethia Hodges works to persuade black people to participate in trials, but has said that predispositions are “tough to overcome”.“The reasons I hear African Americans will not participate are heartbreaking and disappointing,” Ms Hodges told NBC News.Other experts also note that institutions have also failed to push the inclusion of black Americans in the number of vaccine studies under way.Don\u0027t tell me I should stop protesting and wait to vote in Joe Biden“There is a fear with Covid-19 how intentional the hundreds of trials are about ersity,” Dr Aletha Maybank, the American Medical Association\u0027s chief equity officer and group vice president of its Centre for Health told the outlet.“I\u0027m not clear and would make the assumption that they are not intentional. If so, I haven\u0027t heard about it yet.But if the distrust pre-Covid-19 was strong, the chances are even less now that black people will participate. I worry about exploitation and medicines\u0027 being used on patients without their knowledge or consent.”Dr John Maupin, the former president of Meharry Medical College and Morehouse School of Medicine, argued that the country needs more historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) conducting research to build trust.Dr Maybank said that building relationships is key to convincing people to participate in the trials and trust research.“Folks doing work from leading institutions have asked, \u0027How do we build trust?\u0027 Well, it\u0027s not rocket science. It\u0027s about building relationships.Are you getting to know me beforehand? Are you speaking in a language I understand? Are the concepts broken down so that they are digestible? Are you present? Are you giving resources to our neighbourhoods beforehand? That\u0027s not rocket science.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Border officers eavesdropped, and trucks sped by, drowning out their already muffled conversations, they said.Other couples and families started showing up at the 0 Avenue ditch, too. For months, it was a strange and dusty meetup spot where couples would go to see each other and would often notice others doing the same.Meeting this way was painful, Ms Bosello said, “but it was still better than nothing”.As the weather warmed and shutdowns lifted, a superior reunion spot emerged in mid-May: Peace Arch Park. There, cross-national couples and families could actually embrace ⁠— at long last.The recently reopened park is situated between Blaine, Wash., and Surrey, BC.“When I finally hugged him again, it felt like it was the first time I ever did,” Ms Bosello said.In fact, the couple, who has been together for five years, was so ecstatic to reunite, they took a huge relationship leap. On 6 June, they gathered a small group of family and friends and got married.“Being separated made us realise what’s truly important to us,” Mr Smith said. “The circumstances we found ourselves in really highlighted that we wanted to make it official.”The couple ordered silicone rings online to use as temporary wedding bands, and Ms Bosello wore a navy dress she had ordered for a friend’s wedding ⁠— paired with sneakers.“It was all very casual and improvised,” Ms Bosello said. “But it was such a wonderful day, and so nice to just turn off everything else going on in the world.”The couple, who meet at the park daily, hopes their marriage will speed up the process of Mr Smith becoming a permanent Canadian resident, for which he submitted an application nearly two years ago.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Smith is originally from Beltsville, Md., and was serving in the military in South Korea when he met Ms Bosello, who was temporarily working abroad as a teacher.Ms Bosello moved home to Canada three weeks after the couple hit it off at a bar in Seoul, and they’ve been in a long-distance relationship ever since. She stayed in Vancouver while Mr Smith moved to Seattle and finally to Blaine.The couple would see each other regularly because the drive between their respective homes is only about 40 minutes.“For a while, the distance was very manageable,” Ms Bosello said. “Then the pandemic hit.”They are not the only couple who had the idea to tie the knot at the border.Before the park reopened, Liz Peters’ parents drove seven hours from Portland, Oregon, to celebrate her wedding along 0 Avenue, while still standing on American soil. The couple married nearby and met her parents right after to celebrate because they couldn’t be at the ceremony.“I’m very close with my parents and could never imagine them not being there on my wedding day,” said Ms Peters who lives in Abbotsford, BC.But as word started getting out about the lucky loophole at Peace Arch Park, lovesick Americans and Canadians began showing up there to be together.The day after Mr Smith and Ms Bosello tied the knot, Ryan Hamilton and Savannah Koop did too.Ms Koop, a Canadian, and her American husband also met regularly along 0 Avenue before the park reopened, each with their own coffee and snacks, for weekly date nights.“It was so hard to be so close yet so far,” Ms Koop said.When the couple heard the park reopened, they also decided to make their love official in the only place they could be together after their original wedding was cancelled because of the pandemic.This spontaneous ceremony, they said, was even more special after their time apart.The park is considered equal parts American and Canadian ⁠— a shared territory for citizens of both countries to visit. The southern half is owned by Washington State Parks, while the northern half is owned by British Columbia Provincial Parks.Entryways from both the American and Canadian sides are patrolled, and the park itself is surveyed to ensure no one exits the wrong side. But as long as visitors stay within the 42-acre area, they are permitted to roam freely throughout the grounds. According to the park’s website, it is a space that is “devoted to peace and serenity”.Chelsea Horner who is in the midst of an American immigration process, took a ferry with her two kids from Canada to meet her husband, who is based on Whidbey Island, Wash.US border agents save three migrant teenagers from ‘perilous canal’US border agent found dead after disappearing on patrol in New MexicoResidents warn workers building Trump’s wall could spread coronavirusPregnant teen falls to her death trying to climb over US border wall“Anything is worth it to be able to see the person you love and unite your family,” she said.The couple, who normally commute back and forth, have plans to meet at the park again for Father’s Day this weekend.In addition to couples, it’s been an important meeting spot for other loved ones.Kylie Hults visits with her parents at the park. She drives two hours from Brenton, Wash., while her folks travel 10 minutes from the Canadian border.Ms Hults, who is an only child, said this time together has been very important for her parents during the pandemic.For them, and many others, Peace Arch Park is “the happiest place on earth”.“It is the Disneyland of the Pacific Northwest,” said Erik Buddingh.The Canadian man ventured to the park to reunite with his American girlfriend, who flew from Indiana to Seattle and then drove to the border for a few stolen hours with him.“The park is filled with grandparents meeting their grandchildren for the first time, families reuniting after being ided by the border closure, couples coming together and even old friends meeting just to catch up,” Mr Buddingh said.Time apart from his long-distance love has taught him to appreciate the little things, he said.Above all, though, “this park shows that love knows no borders”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

CEO Eric Yuan had said that the decision was so Zoom could allow law enforcement access to its calls.That led to a flurry of criticism from activists and privacy groups who argued that the app was unnecessarily endangering conversations.Google brings Meet video calls into Gmail appThe company also shut down the account of a Tiananmen Square activist, who had a paid account, at the behest of the Chinese government. The account was later reinstated.End-to-end encryption means only the communicating users can read the messages. It is a feature of messaging services such as WhatsApp and Signal, but not Facebook Messenger or text messages.Messages, or calls, that are not end-to-end encrypted are less private than those which are.Both free and paid users of Zoom will need to go through a one-time process when making calls to verify their identity, such as confirming a phone number through text message, in order to get end-to-end encryption.Account administrators would be able to enable end-to-end encryption on any group calls, in order to allow phone lines or older conferences room phones to access the call.“Many leading companies perform similar steps on account creation to reduce the mass creation of abusive accounts.

On his death in  the Rhodes Scholarship was set up to help non-British students study at Oxford.Rhodes Scholars include Bill Clinton and three former Australian PMs.The focus of attention is on the statue which is above the entrance to Oriel College, part of Oxford University.The Rhodes Memorial Museum was established in his home town of Bishops Stortford in  but has since changed its name to the Bishops Stortford Museum.The town also has an Arts Centre and road named after him.A protest group called Stortford Against Rhodes has been set up to rename both. It currently has more than , signatures.The cottage in Muizenberg where he died is a provincial heritage site in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.A Rhodes Memorial stands on what is said to have been his favourite spot on Devil’s Peak in Cape Town.Rhodes University College, now Rhodes University, is in Grahamstown, which was set up in his name by trustees.A bronze statue of Rhodes sitting on his horse stands in Kimberley, Northern Cape, which was erected in .The statue marking the le of Cecil Rhodes has long been a contentious issue. As an imperialist and colonist, the legacy of Rhodes has come under intense scrutiny in recent years.He believed the English were the first race in the world and worked hard to extend British influence worldwide, saying: The more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race. Campaigners say Rhodes was a white supremacist.A previous campaign to have the statue removed in  was rejected.The Rhodes Must Fall Oxford campaign group previously called for the image of the controversial mining magnate and empire builder to be removed from Oriel College, arguing the university has failed to address its institutional racism.Demonstrators have protested in front of the Rhodes statue on the High Street in Oxford as part of the Black Lives Matter movement.An open letter from campaigners to the universitys vice-chancellor claims the institution has only made inconsequential inroads into tackling the material legacy of imperialism, adding it is not enough.Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran said, while she did not endorse vigilante action, the statue must come down.She said: The statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. Thats why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.Im not endorsing vigilante action - but I would urge Oriel College in the strongest terms to think about what message this statue sends in , and to remove it.However, following protests the college said it had recommended to take down the statue and added that consultations will now take place into the issue and Rhodes legacy.Rhodes suffered ill health throughout his relatively short le.His heart condition ed when he was  with increasing severity until his death from heart failure in , aged , at his seaside cottage in Muizenberg.To mark his death the South African government organised a train to travel from the Cape to Rhodesia with it stopping at every station so mourners could pay their respect.He was eventually buried at World’s View, a hilltop some  miles from Bulawayo in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits. If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.THREE cheers for Marcus Rashford, a magnicent role model who yesterday won his campaign to make sure Britain’s poorest kids get one square meal a day over the summer. We know it will have been tough for the PM to swallow his pride and U-turn. But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense. So their instincts tell them to keep Britain in lockdown for as long as possible. But elected politicians know that  poverty and  mass unemployment kill just as surely as the virus. It’s time they showed some leadership and started easing restrictions in earnest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The court heard that before the Graydons bought the home, the adjoining house had been converted so that up to seven rooms were rented inidually as bedsits to tenants.Mr Graydon, , who runs his own PR and communications company, told the judge police attended the bedsit very frequently and they had to put up with the noise of loud partying and people coming and going at all hours.Mrs Graydon, who is a communications director for Caterham School, claimed groups would gather outside the house for drunken sessions - which sometimes ended in violence and police cars or ambulances turning up.She said at times her family felt unsafe using their own back garden because of the type of noise coming from the garden of the next door property.Mr and Mrs Graydon claimed the former owners made adeliberate omission about the neighbouring property.Barrister Kwabena Owusu, representing Mr and Mrs Cook, argued it was a case of having a dferent experience compared to the current owners.He told the judge: Their case is that they werent signicantly disturbed by noise.Mr and Mrs Crook had no such experience .They have been perfectly sincere in the answers they have given the court and gave you at the time.Mr Owusu added that in the  years the couple lived at the property they never had a reason to call the police because of next door.The Graydons accepted that the current occupants are quieter than some of the previous tenants.They claimed damaged for the alleged misrepresentation and said their house was actually worth £, less than what they boughtor.The judge rejected the Graydons claim and he said he was not convinced that Mr and Mrs Crook had the same experience when they lived in the house.The Graydons now face a court bill which is expected to run well into five figures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Rhodes Scholars include Bill Clinton and three former Australian PMs.Students campaigned to have the figure of Victorian empire builder torn down in  over claims he was a racist. But Oriel College decided to keep it following threats from wealthy donors to withdraw £million in funding. “Both of these decisions were reached after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection, and with the full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world.The commission will deal with the issue of the Rhodes legacy and how to improve access and attendance of BAME undergraduate, graduate students and faculty, together with a review of how the colleges st-century commitment to ersity can sit more easily with its past.An open letter from campaigners to the universitys vice-chancellor claimed the institution has only made inconsequential inroads into tackling the material legacy of imperialism, adding it is not enough.Thousands of people signed two petitions calling for the statue of colonialist Rhodes at Oriel College to be taken down.A student at Oriel in his youth, Rhodes left the college money and also endowed the Rhodes Scholarships, which have allowed more than , students from countries around the world, including former US President Bill Clinton, to study at Oxford.The mining magnate was a central figure in Britains colonial project in southern Africa, giving his name to Rhodesia, present-day Zimbabwe, and founding the De Beers diamond empire.It comes amid a wider decolonise movement sweeping universities across the world in recent years.The Rhodes Must Fall movement was established in  at Cape Town University, and later spread to Oxford, where students demanded the statue of Rhodes was removed from Oriel College.In , Oriel College decided to keep the statue following threats from wealthy donors to withdraw £million in funding.Elsewhere today work started in central London to remove the metal boards covering Sir Winston Churchills statue ahead of the French presidents visit to London tomorrow.Sir Winstons statue, along with those of Nelson Mandela and Gandhi, was boarded up on June , after it was defaced with graffiti saying he was a racist during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.The news comes after a statue of th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and dumped into Bristol Harbour during a recent Black Lives Matter protest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year.

Preexisting risk factors such as levels of obesity, the number of people aged above , and the number of international arrivals were also taken into account. The most signicant reason for the UKs low score was its levels of excess deaths. The report singled out the countrys low levels of testing and a controversial decision to stop contact tracing in March as contributing factors. It added that the UKs position as an international travel hub, and the number of people passing through airports like Heathrow, could have played a part. The government has also been criticised for delaying the decision to lockdown until after the country was already seeing signicant spread of the virus. The UK has so far seen , deaths from the pandemic, signicantly more than any other country with a comparable population. Only Brazil and the US, whose populations are three and five times that of the UK respectively, have seen more deaths.In spite of its high death toll, the US performed well in the rankings once its initial risk factors were taken into account. In contrast to Britain, other poorly-performing countries like Spain and Italy were hit early on in the pandemic and had little time to prepare, the report said. It also said that the UKs centralised healthcare system meant the government had a wealth of public health data that should have aided its response.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UKs relatively low levels of sunshine and Brits diets mean vitamin D deficiency is a widespread problem in the country. An estimated one in five adults and one in six children dont get enough vitamin D - a problem that its feared could be being exacerbated by the lockdown. One study by Anglia Ruskin University found that European countries in which vitamin D deficiency is prevalent have seen elevated death tolls since the start of the pandemic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, part of the Department of Health, has now announced a rapid evidence review looking at the trend, thereported. The results of the review are set to be published in the coming weeks. The Scientic Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which advises Public Health England and other government organisations on nutrition, will also complete a report. Heightened vulnerability caused by a lack of vitamin D could be part of the reason that both the elderly and certain ethnic minority groups have seen higher fatality rates from the virus.Melanin, the pigment that makes a persons skin darker, lowers the skins ability to produce vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. The bodys ability to produce the vitamin also diminishes as a person gets older. In April, Public Health England advised Brits to begin taking vitamin D supplements to help maintain bone and muscle health during the lockdown.Earlier this month, the Scottish government also recommended that anyone from an ethnic group with darker skin should begin taking the supplement. Officials are said to be discussing whether the supplement could be prescribed in hospitals to help mitigate the impact of any second wave.Professor Adrian Martineau of Queen Mary University, currently leading a study into the vulnerability to coronavirus of people with dferent lestyles, told thethe benefits of vitamin D could be considerable. Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections, he said. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

International Trade Secretary Liz Truss revealed the UK wanted to become a member of the -strong Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacic Partnership. Countries signed-up to the pact include Australia and New Zealand – which the UK will open separate talks in the coming weeks – as well as Brunei, Vietnam and Peru. Ms Truss told the Commons: Agreements with New Zealand and Australia are an important step towards our vision of a truly global Britain – a Britain that is once again a fierce campaigner for free trade.  A Britain that leads by example and membership of CPTPP is the next logical step. “Joining the agreement would show the rest of the world we are back as a proud, independent nation prepared to look far beyond our own shores.Her Labour counterpart Emily Thornberry said trade deal talks were already underway with CPTPP countries apart from “Malaysia and Brunei, which between them accounted for just .% of the UKaposs total world trade last year”.Urging the Government to target efforts on securing a deal with the EU, she added: “The businesses I speak to around the country simply cannot understand why the Government is spending so much time and effort trying to negotiate international trade deals of relatively little value when it is yet to secure our continued trade with Europe.  “When the % of our trade that depends on Europe is still hanging in the balance then that is where the Governmentaposs priorities should lie.” While Britain formally left the bloc on January , exit triggered an -month transition to allow time to agree a trade pact. The clock is ticking down to the December  deadline when, the Government insists, the transition will end and not be extended. However, talks have stalled over allowing EU boats to fish in British waters and the UK having access to the single market. Sue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at consumer group Which , said: There are many potential benefits to be gained from trade deals with Australia and New Zealand. “Ultimately, their success will be judged by the impact they have on the price, choice and safety of products and services we use everyday so any deals must reflect consumersapos expectations.

Today, the Mirror is calling for the Government to work with parents, teachers, education unions and council leaders to get children back into school. We want ministers to to find alternative spaces, such as church halls, community centres, sports venues and libraries to give schools the space they need to maintain social distancing. Heads should be given funding to hire extra staff, including supply and trainee teachers and –it’s safe for them – recently retired teachers. The poorest children should be given free internet and equipment to narrow the ide, so no child is left behind.  And we need a massive catch-up programme to run over the over the summer, and beyond, to help those who have missed out on education at home. Prof Viner said: “Children need their schools. Every child deserves to have an uninterrupted education. But teachers do so much more than teach and schools provide so much more than education. Schools are vital to the wellbeing of children, providing a range of services from vaccinations to mental health support. Schools are also where at-risk children are looked out for and supported. Schools are also where our children run around, play and laugh and argue with each other. They need toto that sort of a healthy normality as soon as possible.”  Lib Dem’s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: “Making our High Streets Covid-secure is critical. But it seems the Prime Minister is more concerned about allowing betting shops to re-open than getting children safely back into school. “It shows where the Government’s priorities lie. Schools urgently need the resources for more space and staff so that more pupils cansafely. Boris Johnson needs to take responsibility for this shambles, work with teachers and experts to agree a plan and stop treating our schools like a political football.” Labour Leader Keir Starmer told the Mirror: “It was Education Secretary Gavin Williamson who said on June  we’re not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer. I have said repeatedly that I want schools to reopen as soon as possible. I’ve offered to work with the Prime Minister to address this issue.” Coronavirusandschools.org.uk is giving parents and carers educational advice from real teachers while the schools are closed. The website has been set up by the National Education Union who represent almost half a million teachers and support staff. It features video tips from teachers, QAs on exams and tests, learning at home and child wellbeing. Plus there are fun activities parents can do with their children to stimulate their brains and keep them learning.  Click here to check it out for advice, resources and useful links. Mr Starmer, who has sent his own children to school through the lockdown because his we works for the NHS, added: “This is a Government with a majority of , it has its responsibilities and it should be doing everything in its power to reopen schools as soon as possible. The PM wants all England’s children back in school from September, after six months of coronavirus disruption. But he has tried to sht the blame for the fact that many of those in the years that are eligible tohave not yet done so.  Government plans to bring in Years R,  and  are in chaos, and a third of England’s primary failed to do so by June . Proposals to bring back Years , ,  and  by the start of July had to be dropped after officials accepted there was not enough space to maintain social distancing. Distancing rules have left schools scrambling to find space and rope in support staff to lead lessons. Ministers have been urged to adopt more creative proposals, including taking a Nightingale approach – based on the temporary hospitals set up to treat Covid- patients – to schools by providing extra space in community centres and town halls.  They have also been told to make sure heads have enough funding to encourage recently retired and supply teachers back into the classroomit is safe for them to do so. Downing Street is planning to set out its “catch up” plans for the summer later this week, and further plans “within weeks” to get more children back into the classroom after the summer holidays. The PM’s official spokesman said: “The PM has set out a very clear message… school is safe and he wants parents to send their children back to school. We’ll continue to encourage parents to have their kids back in school and I’m sure those numbers will continue to rise.” But Mr Johnson suggested that Labour and the trade unions were hampering efforts to reopen. He said: “The kids that can go to school, should go to school and wouldn’t it be a fine thingwe heard from all sides of the House that schools are safe to go to, rather than the wibble-wobble that we’ve heard from the Opposition ” But four education unions being quizzed by the Commons Education committee hit back, and demanded more clarity and action from the Government.  Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned MPs something would have to givethe Government wanted schools to open fully in September under current rules. “If the Government retains its social distancing rules, then they can’t [opne],” she said. “So that’s why we then need to look at an education recovery plan, which is focused on more than school buildings. “[It’s] about increasing the physical footprint of the school, about increasing the numbers of teachers available to teach smaller classes, and about a national plan for blended learning.” Jon Richards, National Secretary at Unison, said “you have to have facilities set up” and there were still “serious issues” around cleaning and canteens. Julie McCulloch, of the ASCL union, said: “If it’s at all possible and considered safe then absolutely we want all children to be back in school from September. “That is by far the best solution. But we’re not able to do that at the moment within the Government’s own protective measures guidance. The maths just doesn’t work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gyms leisure centres five aside","story":"NewsGyms, leisure centres and five-a-side games couldin July, minister saysYoga, weight sessions, five-a-side footie with pals - all could be allowed from as early as July  after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden hinted that grassroots sport will be the next focus now the Premier League is back on TV screensShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video oliver-dowden-quizzed-public-toilets-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics gyms-leisure-centres-five-aside-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Premier League football ed tonight, but in empty stadiums. Dowden said: Sports recovery is never just about elite sports. I know people are itching to get back to their gyms, their leisure centres, their five-a-side leagues… and all the normal fitness activities. So we are working closely to get grassroots and community sport back and up running as soon as it’s safe to so - with an aim at the start of July at the very earliest.  There are warnings however, that gym users may find social distancing dficult, while swimming pool etiquette will be markedly dferent. Swimmers were today warned they will need to get used to a new normal when pools reopen. People will be asked to avoid swimming butterfly at busy times or overtaking other pool users in order to maintain social distancing in the water, according to new guidance released today.  Swim England is also recommending arriving with a swimming costume under clothes and showering at home to reduce the amount of time spent in changing rooms when facilities are allowed to welcome visitors again. Pools are being encouraged to only offer sessions that can be booked in advance and apply one-way systems on poolside to help keep swimmers apart. Facilities were forced to close in March alongside gyms and other public spaces as the Government established strict measures to try and slow the spread of coronavirus. Chief executive of Swim England Jane Nickerson said: When pools reopen it will not be a case of business as usual and we know that things will have to be dferent. However,we are to play our part in protecting the NHS from another wave of Covid- admissions it is important we follow the latest guidance and adjust to the new normal. .

A source told Sky News: Boris doesnapost like it being grey.

One in five in this “lost generation” have suffered deteriorating physical health during the lockdown, and a third say their mental health has worsened. Nearly half believe their personal finances will take a hit in the next year, found an Ipsos Mori poll for the Centre for Ageing Better. The charity’s chief Anna Dixon said: “This group are being ignored when it comes to proposed actions to support the recovery. At the same time, it’s clear this group also face serious risks to their health.“If this generation continues to be an afterthought in the coronavirus recovery we’ll see a lost generation entering retirement in poorer health and worse financial circumstances than those before them.” It came amid suggestions that Chancellor Rishi Sunak was considering suspending the Tories’ triple-lock pensions manesto pledge.The mechanism ensures the state pension rises in line with the highest of wages, inflation or .%, so any change would save the Treasury billions – but also risks angering millions of pensioners. Experts believe a temporary suspension is inevitable unless the Government is prepared to pay a massive bill next year. There are signs that the bounce back in wages for furloughed workers could push up average earnings and put pensioners in line for an % increase. There is also uncertainty over inflation. Boris Johnson yesterday warned of “tough times ahead” as ministers faced pressure to increase support for some of the poorest households.The triple lock could be replaced with a lower guaranteed minimum of % or .%, or a “double lock” – raising the pension by the highest of inflation or earnings growth, but with no guaranteed minimum.  Retirement expert and former Tory Pensions Minister Ros Altmann said: “The Government absolutely must protect pensioners... However, all policy decisions are likely to be revisited in light of the health and economic crisis. “It is important not to rush to hasty conclusions, but I hope [people] will consider the way the triple lock actually works and objectively assess whether it may have run its course.” Downing Street played down the suggestion the triple lock could be suspended or scrapped. But a No source said: “These are unique and challenging economic circumstances and we can’t hide from that.”A spokesman for Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “We’ve long said the triple lock is an important means of addressing the relatively low state pension by international standards.”The TUC also warned the triple lock must stay because our state pension is one of the lowest in the developed world.

Teachersapos leaders demanded public buildings are taken over for extra classroom space - saying there just isnapost room to bring back whole schools of -strong mini-classes.

Distancing rules say children must be taught in bubbles of  kids, each in a separate room. That has left schools scrambling to find space and rope in support staff to lead lessons.

Askedschools could open fully in September under current restrictions, she told the Education Committee: If the Government retains its social distancing rules then they canapost.  So thataposs why we then need to look at an education recovery plan, which is focused on more than school buildings. “We’ve got one, the NEU has got one, about increasing the physical footprint of the school, about increasing the numbers of teachers available to teach smaller classes, and about a national plan for blended learning. Jon Richards, National Secretary at UNISON, said you have to have facilities set up and there were still “serious issues” around cleaning and canteens. He added: I’m hoping we’ll be open to reopen schools, as many as we can, in September. But as Mary said, it will depend to an extent on what the government says.  Julie McCulloch, Director of Policy at the ASCL union, said: If it’s at all possible and considered safe then absolutely we want all children to be back in school from September. That is by far the best solution. But as colleagues have said we’re not able to do that at the moment within the government’s own protective measures guidance. The maths just doesn’t work. If you can only have up to  children in a class, and you’re bringing back all children, you need twice as many classrooms and twice as many teachers. Now clearly there are conversations we can have about how we might be able to have more space and how we might be able to increase the teaching workforce, but neither of those is straightforward. She added the best outcome -the science says that this is safe and appropriate - would be to have all children back with some of those measures relaxed in September.  Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT, added: Schools should open as quickly as possible, we’ve been very very clear about that. We want to see clarity from government about what the expectations are from September in terms of what schooling will look like. The union chiefs have hit back at Tory MPs in a furious clash over whether schools are safe. Tensions bubbled over at the Education Committee, where an MP accused unions of running a political campaign to keep schools shut. Tory Jonathan Gullis, a former teacher, accused unions of breathing fear into parents and making them think schools are death traps. The MP blasted: I am absolutely outraged at the sheer damage the unions have done to the teaching profession. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman insisted today: The PM has set out a very clear message… school is safe and he wants parents to send their children back to school. But the four unions being quizzed by the committee hit back - and demanded more clarity and action from the government. Union chiefs warned it was impossible to bring all pupils back while following guidance to keep them socially distanced and in -pupil classes.

They have previously been free of overt political content - which would require broadcasters to offer opposition politicians equal airtime under impartiality rules.But Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden broke with convention, using today’s briefing to attack Labour leader Keir Starmer.A Labour spokesperson said: People are understandably worried about the health and economic impacts of this pandemic. Rather than inappropriately using the daily briefing for political attacks, the government should be focussed on updating the public on the steps it is taking to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Answering a question from the BBCaposs Hugh Pym on schools, Mr Dowden said: I do think itaposs important as part of this that we really reassure parents that itaposs safe for their kids to go back. And Iaposve been really heartened by the incredible hard work that Iaposve seen from teachers up and down the country, whoaposve worked so hard in dficult circumstances to get kids back to school. I do think itaposs a bit of a shame that their unions and indeed, it appears, the leader of the Labour party is not also providing them with that kind of backing and support.Earlier at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Boris Johnson repeatedly demanded Mr Starmer declare schools safe.But just last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson scrapped plans tomore year groups to the classroom. And the government came under fire after it emerged only % of school and Further Education pupils were currently attending lessons.

We face the prospect of a generation in their s and s retiring in poor health and without enough money to support themselves. Research by the Centre for Ageing Better suggests a fth of people in those age groups have seen their physical health deteriorate during lockdown, and over a third say their mental health has worsened. This Government has already decided to scrap free TV licences for the over-s. Now there are reports that the pension triple-lock is in its sights too. With an estimated .million pensioners on or below the poverty line, this would be not only a shortsighted move but a vindictive one.

Fitting rooms are to be closed wherever possible butsomething needs to be tried on then new protocols are in place - which involve a kind of aposquarantineapos for items. This UK government advice applies in England only. The guidance states that shoes or clothes which have been tried on should be storied in a container or separate room for  hours...before displaying them on the shop floor.

A study of , adults found one third have been putting extra money aside - an average of £ - since lockdown began. More than two thirds of thoseare saving more by putting away the money they would normally spend on eating out, while almost half have banked refunds from cancelled holidays. And  per cent have saved the money they would have spent commuting to work. A fortunate three in  adults said they are currently financially better off than before the Covid- pandemic, while  per cent have managed to maintain their level of wealth. It also emerged spending habits have changed dramatically since the start of the lockdown, with the average adult £ better off after cutting back on unnecessary things such as clothing, takeaway coffee, eating out and entertaining. Maitham Mohsin, head of savings at Skipton Building Society, which commissioned the research, said: These are financially challenging times for many, so it is reassuring to see that some adults are able to set aside savings for a rainy day, to make the best use of their reduced savings. This pandemic is witnessing a change in attitudes to wealth, savings, and money - as people, are more than before understanding the real need to have a financial buffer for unforeseen eventualities such as furlough or job loss. Many people have had to take payment holidays on mortgages, and dip into savings to get by over these last two or three months never before has a savings pot been so needed. And this in itself is likely to encourage a more sensible approach to financial planning moving forward.  The study also found that Brits have seen their spending reduce on things like fuel, commuting and alcohol, which is helping them to save more than before. It emerged those who are saving more during lockdown have also been able to do so because they are spending less on childcare costs , family days outand birthday presents . Instead, more has been spent on cleaning products , TV streaming servicesand books or magazines to pass the time . However, the survey also highlights that one quarter of adults are worse off financially since the pandemic struck. One in four have had to accept a pay reduction since the crisis began, and  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, have taken either a loan or mortgage holiday - or both. It also emerged  per cent of adults have had to dip into their savings during lockdown - spending an average of £ to pay for essential bills , foodand council tax . But regardless of a personaposs current financial situation, six in  adults now say they are more likely to put money away for a rainy day, rather than spend it when they do have it. And while a fth are putting less money into savings at the moment, eight in  say theyaposd feel even more nervousthey didnapost have any rainy day fund to fall back on. In particular,  per cent of adults like to have savings for unexpected or emergency payments, and  per cent like to put money aside for home improvements.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove.  He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter. It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds. No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum. He worked as a policeman, and a certicate from  and a framed picture of him in his unorm was found in one of the bedrooms.

Questions such as aposWhere you going on holiday apos or aposWhat you up to this weekend apos are to be discouraged during hair washing. Instead,they get the go-ahead to reopen in early July, hairdressers are being asked to observe a apossilence ruleapos. The National Hair and Beauty Federationhas advised members to keep chat to a minimum to protect both staff and customers. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   It comes as the federation is urging the Government to publish full guidance as salons will need two weeks to redesign. In a letter to Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, NHBF has expressed disappointment that “despite a real sense of progress” no official guidance is yet available. One hairdressing group, meanwhile, has already told its staff not to talk to customers whilst theyaposre having their hair washed and head massaged. Contemporary Salons, which has shops throughout the North East and North Yorkshire will make sure all staff have PPE.  Customers will also take part in a aposvirtual consultationapos so theof appointment can be assessed. Alan Simpson, Managing Director, said salons would be looking at aposmaintenance appointmentsapos to begin with before making more complicated sessions available in the coming weeks. No formal decision has been made by the Prime Minister on when salons and barber shops will be allowed to reopen. The National Hair and Beauty Federationare advising members to talk to clients side by side looking into the mirror and to limit discussions. Their advice issued to barbers and walk-in salons is: Avoid face-to-face discussions with clients. Discussions about cut, colour and treatments should be made via the mirror while standing behind the client and kept to a minimum. You can lower the risk of infectionyou stand or sit side-to-side rather than facing people. Consider offering online consultations to reduce the appointment time. “This could be done before your salon or barbershop is fully open for business. This also gives you an opportunity to talk to clients about safety measures you’re taking to protect them and your team and to establishan allergy alert test is needed.Other tips include urging customers not to bring coats or jackets into salonsthe weather is good because the virus can stay on fabrics for days.And salons have been encouraged to put out a slotted container for tips. A spokesman for NHBF said: Salons are putting their own rules in place based on common sense and trying to limit contact with clients as much as possible.

He said Wednesday saw some spectacular lightning bolts, with rain continuing into the night for many, though all Brits experienced a warm and muggy lead into Thursday. The rain across the south should spread northwards and westwards all the while against some heavy bursts in it, but generally it should be dry for much of Scotland and Northern Ireland, he continued.Loch Rannoch could see the peak of the warmth on Thursday, with the Met Office predicting a high of C by the afternoon, while Norwichaposs expected C is the hottest England can hope for. Given some sunshine and bright spells across southern England [and] South Wales, more thunderstorms will break out into the afternoon, said Mr Danaos. Again, like the last few days, they could cause some problems.  Friday will see storms developing in central, northern and eastern areas and it could also be the last of the warm and humid air. The forecaster said the weekend will see a big change, feeling windier and fresher as an Atlantic low sweeps across our shores.

The notice demands a number of changes which need to be made by the coupleaposs attorney by August - or the application will be thrown out. The notice reads: The wording aposproviding a website featuring content relating to philanthropy, monetary giving, volunteer and career opportunitiesapos in International Class  is also indefinite and over broad, and must be claried to specy the nature of the content provided.  The notice also states that Meghan and Harry have failed to cough up additional fees to process the application. To make matters worse the non-final office action was unsigned which meant that the application could not be veried. Despite this, their trademark can be held without being active until the amendments are made. Harry and Meghan are launching Archewell, a well-being empire that is named after their son Archie, which will reportedly run emotional support groups and a multi-media educational empire.  The couple said Archewell was created to do something of meaning, to do something that matters. The Duke and Duchess told the Daily : Like you, our focus is on supporting efforts to tackle the global Covid- pandemic but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how this came to be. Before SussexRoyal, came the idea of aposArcheapos - the Greek word meaning apossource of actionapos.  We connected to this concept for the charitable organisation we hoped to build one day, and it became the inspiration for our sonaposs name.  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman uks biggest lips makes","story":"NewsWoman with UKs biggest lips makes £, each month by financially degrading menADULT CONTENT.

She wants a full head-to-toe transformation, and is willing to go to extreme s to get her dream appearance. She said: “Facial feminisation is one of my big procedures I have planned as I’m trans and have certain features on my face that I don’t like. Although I’ve been changing my appearance for a few years now, I know this is just the start for me!

Sofia, from Lancashire, hopes her next surgery, which sheaposs planning to travel to Florida for, will give her her dream boobs. But getting her dream look isnapost cheap, and Sofia has come up with an unusual way to make cash.  She makes thousands of pounds each month by sharing saucy photos of herself online, specialising in financially degrading men. She started off working as an escort then realised she could make extra cash with the unusual approach which sees men pay her to demand money from them. She said: I started off escorting then quickly realised there is this whole world of findomand cash pigs and cash slaves.  My mind was blown and I’ve not looked back since.

I told him, ‘yes, start by emptying your bank account into mine and then I want you to write lines saying, I must obey goddess Sofia Lips’ and he sent me £ and is still writing lines. She had some very bizarre requests since starting the unusual role, and she claims that some men just ask to meet her at cashpoints. They enter their pin and allow her to withdraw however much money she likes. She said: Some men are very strange.

German expert Dr Mark Benecke, who once examined Adolf and Eva Hitleraposs skulls in Moscow, suspects Christian Brueckner is a narcissist with an antisocial personality disorder. Brueckneraposs previous convictions for violence point towards classic psychopathic crimes, and the ages of his victims suggest it is more about power than a sexual liking of a particular age group, said Dr Benecke. Many violent criminals who prey on children are in fact total weaklings, choosing easier targets such as kids or the elderly because those victims put up less of a fight, the expert added.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Dr Benecke, a university lecturer who has been an expert witness in criminal trials around the world, told : Since he committed so many dferent offences he might have an antisocial personality disorder. He might be psychopathic, which means antisocial plus narcissistic personality disorder. A chilling portrait has emerged of Brueckner since he was identied as the chief suspect in the McCann case He has almost  convictions in Germany for crimes including sexually abusing two girls, raping a -year-old woman, drug trafficking and theft.  Previous girlfriends claim he was violent towards them and former neighbours and friends claim he made cryptic comments about Madeleine and children, had a -year-old girlfriend when he was in his s, was aggressive and threatening towards them, and threw drug and booze-fuelled parties. It has emerged police found girlsapos swimwear, childrenaposs clothes and , child abuse images - showing the abuse of infants, children and adolescents - while investigating the child sex predator four years ago. Brueckner does not have any children. Police found about  pictures of Brueckner partly naked or wearing black stockings and committing a sex act. Officers were looking for the body of five-year-old Inga Gehricke, who vanished in a forest near Stendal, northern Germany, in May . Nine months after she disappeared, officers raided a disused factory site near Braunschweig, which Brueckner had bought six years earlier at auction. Germany’s Spiegel TV revealed in a documentary that police seized a red and white Tfin Allegro Bay motor home in May , as part of the investigation into the disappearance of Inga, the so-called German Maddie. During a six-day examination of the site, police also found computer memory sticks with more than , files, mostly containing pictures and videos of child abuse, the documentary said.  The items were in a carrier bag buried beneath the body of Brueckner’s dog. Police claim they also discovered an online chat where he told someone he wanted to catch something little and use it for days, record maaaany videos clips and document in detail how sheaposs being tortured. Brueckner also allegedly boasted the motorhome he owned and drove repeatedly between Germany and Portugal was ideal for hiding “drugs and children”. He was charged in relation to the child abuse images, but not in relation to Inga, who went missing during a family picnic and has never been found.  After Brueckner was named the prime suspect in the McCann case, police forces across Europe began taking another look at unsolved child disappearances or murders, and rapes of women. In Germany, police are reviewing several cases, including the disappearance of Inga. Brueckner lived in rundown homes in Portugal and when Maddie vanished he was living a transient lestyle in a VW camper van. When he was in the Algarve he worked in a bar and fixed up cars for cash. But prosecutors say he became a drter and supplemented his income through burglaries and theft. A former neighbour said Brueckner in a disgusting and absolutely vile farm building near Praia da Luz, the same resort where Madeleine disappeared in May , and left behind wigs and exotic clothing when he abruptly moved out.  The ex-neighbour told Sky News: “He arrived in the mid-s and rented the place from the English owner. He went back to Germany at one stage and moved another German guy in to look after it, then came back and threw him out on the street. “He was always a bit angry, driving fast up and down the lane. And then one day, around , he just disappeared without a word. I think he left some rent unpaid. Born Christian Fischer in , Brueckner spent time in a childrenaposs home and was adopted by Brigitte and Fritz Brueckner, who later sent him away after he got into trouble, according to neighbours.  Neighbours said the couple were unable to control him and sent him to a reform school for delinquent teenagers in Wurzburg. As an adult he has split his time between Portugal and Germany, where he ran a kiosk in Braunschweig and had a -year-old girlfriend when he was in his s. German prosecutors have described the suspect as a child sex predator. He was convicted in Germany of sexually abusing two girls in Germany - one when he was just  - and of raping the -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz. Brueckner entered her flat at night and tied her up before raping her and beating her with a weapon as he filmed the carefully planned attack in September .  Last December, he was sentenced to seven years in a German prison after the attack went unsolved for almost  years. Cologne-based Dr Benecke, , said: His previouspoint towards classic psychopathic crimes on the one hand, but it might also be more due to a possible drug habit. Of course, both or all three - drugs plus antisocial plus narcissistic traits - can mix. The age range of Brueckneraposs victims - from young girls to a pensioner - means it might be more about power than about a particular age group he likes sexually, said Dr Benecke.  The expert added: Some offenders even deny the sexual part and insist it was only about the apospureapos abuse, killing, stealing etc. For example, Samuel Little, a recent case from the US, said so. Little, now  and in prison, is the most prolic serial killer in US history, recently confessing to almost  murders that took place between  and . Dr Benecke added: Also, many offenders are not paedophiles but just use a person that may resist less since they, the offenders, are total weaklings.  I had cases like this where the offenders really just picked kids because the kids could be convinced more easily to come with the offenders because the offenders were not actual paedophiles, just extremely soft, weak, unexperienced, aposlimpapos personalities, far away from psychopathy. Careful planning suggests Brueckner is most likely a narcissist - an I am better than anybody -type who thinks all others are idiots - and antisocial, said Dr Benecke. The antisocial traits reflect a person with a mindset of I do not care about the needs of others, my needs are all that is of relevance, he added. How to get a confession  Investigators face an uphill battle in trying to get any information from their suspect, who is in solitary confinement in jail to protect him from fellow inmates. Brueckneraposs lawyer has said the suspect will refuse to answer questions because German prosecutors must produce proof he was involved in Maddieaposs disappearance.  Lawyer Friedrich Fulscher told the Mirror he asked Brueckner about the McCann case and his client denied any involvement. Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was just three years old when she vanished from her familyaposs holiday apartment in Praia da Luz  years ago. German prosecutors suspect she is dead, but have said they do not know where her body is and they do not have enough evidence to charge anyone with murder. Dr Benecke said investigators will probably need to work Brueckner to make him feel as though he is the smartest person in the room and that he stands to gain something from speaking. He added:need the feeling of being more clever than anybody  and to get something out of it - higher status, money, deals, for example. Sometimes, they also cooperate - like Juergen Bartsch, Samuel Little and Luis Garavito, who even drew us a map with all the corpses - because the want to tell their story... in a proud manner that shows how aposcleverapos they are. Also, it is important to understand the true motives. True paedophile  True sexual reasons  Because,not, they will consider the interviewer to be an idiot. Dr Benecke is the only forensic scientist to work on the case of Luis Garavito, one of the worldaposs worst serial killers.

Players pick up on that.“Having Gordon Strachan and Jimmy Nicholl’s experience is fantastic as well.“We might have our playing experience but they have  years more experience in the game than any of us. That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places. I was unfortunate because I’d chosen to have surgery to tidy up an ankle problem that had niggled me.“The plan was that would tie in with the close season and I could start pre-season.“But it hindered me and I was behind with my fitness and struggled a bit to get back to form.“Dave, obviously, came in and did well and I think him being able to play in a few positions helped him, too.“I recognised at that time, being in my mid-s I wanted to be playing every week and I wouldn’t get that at St Johnstone.“I’ve nothing against Del, that’s the decisions that have to be made to win games – when Dave came in, the manager couldn’t guarantee me games and I heard there was interest from Dundee.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Adventures full of wholesome family fun.A video is doing the rounds of alternative lockdown titles for the tales – Mum Wonders If am Is Too Early To Crack Open The Gin, The Kids Watch Netflix for  Hours, Mum Wishes Kipper Would Give Her Five Minutes Peace and Dad Gives Kipper a Really Stupid Haircut.I’m all about the stories in the news that make us feel better about ourselves.I’ve got to laugh when I compare the first week of lockdown me with the current one.Back in March, we – along with more than a million households worldwide – logged on to YouTube for an exciting daily morning Joe Wicks PE lesson, doing his Spider-man lunges and Pokemon jumps with vigour. This lasted two days .One night during that first week, the kids were watching a movie and I took the opportunity to start day one of  of a YouTube yoga course which promised to turn you into a zen goddess with a flat stomach.Then,  seconds in, the instructor said: “Place your yoga mat somewhere in the house and do not move it for  days – that way, you will remember to do your daily workout. That is your space, your time, every day.”I actually laughed. This was for someone without kids. I did the class, enjoyed it, then somehow never found a quiet half hour again.Well, that’s a lie.I find quiet time when the kids are in bed, but frankly, who has the motivation to do anything other than watch mindless TV by then I started off teaching the kids’ a Spanish phrase every day. Total phrases learned  One.Total pounds gained  I’ve stopped counting after my last check resulted in a near panic attack.As one pal with a wee girl put it: “I started off teaching her adverbsand French.“Now I’m happywe make it out of our pyjamas.”I like putting myself down– and I like the stories of self-deprecation that make me feel better too.If I do have any friends who have become Jane Fonda or whose kids have learnt fluent Mandarin or how to play Mozart during lockdown, they are doing the decent and kindest thing – keeping it to themselves.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The football was great.

Twelve ICU beds will be kept for coronavirus patients, with a total capacity of  beds with extra available areas.Emergency and unscheduled care and protected services will be kept, and theatre capacity will be re-mobilised to allow patients requiring urgent and cancer surgeries to take place.Albyn Hospital is also to help with additional theatre capacity, and the health board is working with the Golden Jubilee Hospital and other areas to increase out of area capacity.Woodend Hospital will provide minor trauma surgical interventions, and will also continue to provide critical services such as stroke, neuro and ortho rehabilitations.A total of  new domestic staff have joined NHS Grampian, and  existing staff have increased their contracts to help out, with touch surface cleaning increasing in some areas to every  minutes.A statement from NHS Grampian said: #We are aware there will be many other efforts and changes being made across Grampian.#We are very proud of and would like to thank all health and social care staff who have been working tirelessly to adapt and flex to what has been required of them during this changing time.#During the months ahead we will continue to work closely together, learning from what has worked well and building on the progress and successes we have had.#We hope all staff will input to this journey, to make sure the services we provide are the best they can be for those who receive them, and those who work in them.#More technological-based services are being utilised where possible, such as mental health and learning disability services being offered via telephone or Near Me sessions for those who require ongoing contact.The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicesdepartment also using Near Me technology, however most young people continue to be seen on site.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

His neice Cathie McLellan contacted the Advertiser to tell her uncle#s story.#I was too young to remember him, but I know he worked as a male nurse at the Argyll and Bute Hospital before the war.#Like most of the young men in the area he and his pals had joined the territorial army and enjoyed going away to training camps and things.#When the war began Donald, not long engaged to be married, and his friends were called up with the th Argylls. After basic training in Aldershot, they were sent with the st Highland Division to northern France with the British Expeditionary Force to help defend the Maginot Line.The force was no match for Hitler#s blitzkreig and the British and French were forced to retreat to the channel ports, but a number of troops, including the st Highland Division, fought a continuous rearguard action against superior forces.Lance Corporal Donald McLellan was killed in action on June   at the age of .

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly.

work to ldquoensure it follows through on that wish and provides ldquoclarity on the commission.ldquoI think that all efforts will now be directed towards making that intention a reality, he

critically contextualise the statue but will focus on ways that Oriel itself can become much more representative and in fact can offer scholarships and educational opportunities in the places where Rhodesrsquos crimes were committed.Mr Mpofu-Walsh said Rhodes could not ldquoatone for his legacy through the international Rhodes scholarship programme, set up through his will, because it helps some African students.ldquoThe legacy of Rhodes extends wide and deep and affects people in the tens of millions, both in Zimbabwe and South Africa, through the foundations laid for apartheid, he

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

But in Scotland, thanks to Covid it could be within sight. Schoolrsquos out, not just for summer but for the foreseeable future.At least that was the educational prognosis from the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, at the weekend. He announced a new ldquoblended learning, which sounds like something to do with tea, but is a euphemism for Scottish children spending most of the school week at home.:Opinion: Brian Beacom: Why I am edging slowly towards the pro-independence point of viewParents in Edinburgh were told that, when schools go back on August , theyrsquoll be lucky to see their children getting face-to-face teaching for a third of the time. Many Scottish pupils might only get one day a week. This is not so much blended as half-baked.Mr Swinney also endorsed the view of Larry Flanagan, general-secretary of the teachers union the EIS, that next yearrsquos exam diet should be cancelled, like this yearrsquos. Few in the education establishment much like competitive exams at the best of time, so it might seem unsurprising that they have been dropped ndash for the first time since .Parents, who donrsquot seem to have been consulted by Mr Swinneyrsquos misnamed Education Recovery Group, are furious. They see this as an abdication of responsibility by bureaucrats who care nothing about educational attainment and are putting the interests of their own client groups above the welfare of children.Parents in Edinburgh formed an instant pressure group,  , to demand proper, face-to-face education at least  per cent of the week. Sarah Chisnall says they also want serious benchmarked online learning for the other part of the ldquoblended learning experience, with a regular amount of teacher face time.Three months into school lockdown, it is surely a scandal that nothing of the like has been done. Home schooling is practically non-existent in many areas, according to parents, with some children having no contact with anything remotely resembling an actual teacher on line. Google, FIFA  and Instagram are poor substitutes.A UK-wide study from University College London confirmed yesterday that two million children across Britain have done little or no schoolwork at home during the lockdown. Four million have not had regular contact with a teacher and six million have not ed their most recent assignment.Nicola Sturgeon, who recognises a political disaster when she sees one, leaped in to try to undo the damage done by her deputy. ldquoIt is absolutely not the case that we are planning on blended learning to last a year or anything like it, she said on Monday, giving no guarantees that it wonrsquot.The First Minister promised that face-to face-teaching will happen ldquoas soon as possible. Exams will go ahead ndash well maybe ndash and she hinted that the two-metre rule in social distancing might be relaxed in schools.ldquoDelusional. said the SNPrsquos sometime coalition partners, the Scottish Greens, which has a lot of teachers amongst its membership. Like Larry Flanagan of the EIS they think next yearrsquos exams should be cancelled because there is no safe way of preparing children for them.Tell that to the parents. We know that the risk to children is vanishingly small. To prevent pupils spreading the disease to teachers and parents, schools could use masks, hand sanitisers, ldquobubble cohorts, and perspex screens.It is not aschildren arenrsquot associating already out of school. The extra transmission risk from a deep-cleaned environment like a school must surely be negligible. The risks of not going to school ndash mental health, obesity, domestic abuse and the like ndash are almost certainly greater than the risk of Covid.:Coronavirus: Push to prescribe vitamin D to people at highest risk from Covid in bid to curb second wave of virusParents say, rightly, that the two metre rule is not enforced in hospitals. It manestly isnrsquot in supermarkets, parks and public transport either. So why is this bureaucratic red line being applied in schools Why is the education of their children not a priority, they say  With classes and schools only able to handle a third of children, the obvious answer is to increase the number of classrooms and the number of teachers.Break out of the school precincts and start deploying unused venues like cinemas and churches, even marquees. Bring in supply teachers and retired teachers to bump up the numbers.It would of course mean more than the pound million or so in additional funding the Government is currently offering the local authorities. But the Scottish education and skills budget is more than pound. billion. Surely some of that could be reallocated, as was the case in the NHS when they set up ldquopop-up hospitals like the Louisa Jordan.At any rate, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major fight on her hands. The EIS says, correctly, that the two-metre rule is still what the Governmentrsquos scientic advisers say is necessary to prevent a second wave of Covid-. They are not going to sht on that, eventhe World Health Organisation has been talking about reducing it to one metre.There are two million parents out there and only , teachers. Ms Sturgeon can do her political arithmetic. She is going to have to spray some serious cash to get the schools back on any kind of ing basis.Scottish teachers got a  per cent pay hike from the Government last year. I suspect Mr Swinney is going to have to loosen the purse strings again to prevent the deschooling of a generation of Scottish children.The late Ivan Illich, whose thinking influenced the Curriculum for Excellence, envisaged children teaching themselves, using technology, even though he was writing before the internet existed. He would be proud to see the nationrsquos youth gathering around their screens. Unfortunately, parents arenrsquot ndash especiallyit means they lose their chances of educational qualications.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Some will be dedicated, le-long attenders others will have reached retirement before making time to think about faith, and the search for the meaning of le.I have countless friends in their seventies and eighties who are fitter and sharper than many younger folk. It seems invidious to talk of them as a universally frail category perhaps they are better described as having reached a point when there is much less road ahead than in the rear view mirror. Yet, regardless of physical condition, by this stage spiritual sustenance and solace become more pressing and meaningful. Equally comforting is the companionship and consolation of a like-minded community.Brought up as I was in a devout Church of Scotland family, I saw the importance for older members of the routine, ritual and contact weekly services offered. Remembering some of our church-going friends, people of inspiring kindness and integrity, it is deeply upsetting to think that it is iniduals like them, to whom the church owes its very existence, who are being sidelined and devalued. The idea of banishing the elderly, of consigning them to a Zoom link or a virtual coffee morning until the virus has fled, is cruel. Therersquos no other word for it. Those for whom technology is intimidating, confusing, or a second-rate stop-gap, will be left stranded.To withdraw all prospect of real human contact is particularly egregious at a time like this. For months, the -plus have been living in near isolation and confinement, bombarded with terrying news and statistics, and unable to see family or friends. Imprisoned as they have been at home, for them the church represents a calm, still centre during the storm. Many will have been longing to get back into their place of worship, but will now be worried they are not entirely welcome. It doesnrsquot get much more hurtful than that.As well as being harsh, the Kirkrsquos attitude is also short-sighted. Dwindling as its resources are, it relies heavily on bequests. For some parishioners, as they approach old age it is important to know they will continue to contribute to the Church of Scotlandrsquos work, long after they have gone. Their legacies are priceless, not to say essential, but they should not be taken for granted. Codicils and rewrites take minutes.:Bosses warning as Scotland races ahead of other UK nations in unemploymentRegardless of the financial contribution older members have already made, to treat them so negligently is heartless. Of course nobody should fall ill because of attending a Sunday service, butsafety procedures are followed, it will be no more dangerous ndash arguably less so ndash than any other venture or visit.In showing such caution and cowardice, the Kirk has forgotten the principles on which it was founded: it is a Christian duty to tend the sick, befriend the lonely, and to nurture every believerrsquos spirit. This latest salvo smacks more of health and safety or fear of litigation than le-giving care and compassion. The Kirk has never been more necessary for all its members, butever there was a statement of its redundancy, this letter is it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

So we want to make these things easier.ldquoNow the really important thing Irsquove got to stress is wersquove got to still be very careful, because although numbers of cases of the virus and thankfully numbers of people dying or getting very ill with it are declining quite rapidly, it hasnrsquot gone away. Itrsquos still out there.ldquoWe see in other countries right now ndash China is dealing with a new outbreak, some parts of America are seeing cases going up again.ldquoSo itrsquos still a big danger and that means wersquove still got to be careful and take things step by step, which actually it gets harder for me to persuade people of that the more we see levels of the infection reduce, but actually it continues to be really important that we donrsquot get reckless and take too many steps too quickly that then allows it to spread again.During the Capital Scotland radio show Ms Sturgeon was also asked how she looks after her own mental and emotional wellbeing.She said: ldquoItrsquos been dficult I guess over the last wee while because I have been so busy trying to deal with this day by day but Irsquove got a great husband at home who, you know, helps to look after me and make sure Irsquom not getting too stressed out about things.ldquoAnd I suppose, every now and again, Irsquove just tried to take a step back and try to focus on the positives, which during a time like this is not easy to do but there have been positives out of this.ldquoI think the sense of collective and community spirit that we found over the past three months has been really inspiring.ldquoWersquove all done the right thing not just for ourselves but for each other and I hope as we come out of the crisis and get back to normal, we donrsquot lose all of that, that we actually remember that, you know, whether itrsquos enjoying spending a bit more time with immediate family in your own household, or just getting off the treadmill a little bit for some people, that we just remember what really matters in le.

Three years ago teachers were awarded a three-year pay deal, which gave them. per cent each year for three years, not \"a  per cent pay hike\" last year, and this after some years of pay freeze.Ruth Mackay, Kelso.Read More: Letters: Seeds of ision were sown long before the rise of the SNPI AM disappointed with the lack of clarity from the Education Secretary around the reopening of schools and the failure to ensure the young people are given the opportunity toto school with confidence.One of the suggestions is that some pupils attend on Monday and Tuesday with the other half attending on Thursday and Friday to permit deep cleans on Wednesday.Why would we waste the valuable resource of a full day Wednesday for cleaning  I am not denying cleaning is essential to reduce risk of virus transmission, but why can this not be carried out with a back sht after the teaching day ends The young people are the future and decisions cannot be left to inidual schools but must be a priority of the Government at this anxious time. Whether there is a financial cost or not, it should in no way be a barrier to making the best use of the schools and resources available to provide dedicated direct teaching time.Alison Tait, Ayr."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : amOrkney Islands Council#s recycling centres at Hatston and Garson will be accepting heavy corrugated cardboard # as well as garden waste # from Tuesday, June .

Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent.

We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon.

It has allowed the waste crews to collect recyclables that have been stored in folks’ houses, whilst ensuring that our crews are able to work within the requirements of physical distancing. To ensure we have cleared the backlog, we intend to continue with the four-week cycle again.”Green recycling bins and boxes should be put out on your usual bin day – but remember to do this weekly. You should remove the caddies inside # and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as we will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis – again on your usual collection day.This means that the council will collect:• Glass # week commencing June .• Plastic # bottles week commencing June .• Metals and tins # week commencing July .• Paper card # week commencing July .Councillor Drever added: “We want to thank households for their cooperation and patience whilst we continue to clear the backlog of recyclables that folk have been storing during the pandemic.”Just a reminder that paper and card is being collected this week . This should be contained in a single green bin or box. Corrugated cardboard should not be included – either in the bin or left alongside.It is hoped that corrugated cardboard can be accepted from next week at the recycling centres at Hatston and Garson, along with garden waste.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

The updated shielding guidance applies until June  and Dr McBride has said further guidance will be provided before the end of the month.Officials are facing calls to provide clarity to people who are shielding, particularly amid reports that some people are coming under pressure toto work, while concerns have also been raised by younger people who are shielding about the effects the protection measures are having on their children.DUP MLA Alex Easton, a member of the Stormont health committee, said any further letters advising people to shield must include more information for patients and employers.I would like more clarity around shielding in general, he said. My father, who is diabetic and has lost both legs as a result, didn#t receive a letter, so I think that the letters need to include a lot more information.I would like to see the letters include a booklet with a list of conditions and medication that mean patients should shield. There should also be specic information for employers because I have been contacted by people who have been told to shield and they are being expected to work.I think the majority of employers have been very understanding, but the longer this goes on, the more challenging it is going to be for those who are shielding. The next letter should include detailed information for employers about why it is so important that anyone who is shielding should take the precautions that is being sent out by the CMO.People who have been deemed as falling to the highest clinical risk group, and have therefore been told to shield, include anyone who has had an organ transplant, cancer patients, people with motor neurone disease and anyone with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.In the letters being sent out to people this week, Dr McBride explained: I know that this has been a very challenging time for you and that it will not always have been easy to comply with the advice. The Covid- virus still poses a high risksomeone who is shielding is exposed to it. However, infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is signicantly less than it has been over the last two months.Because the risk is lower, I have now updated the guidance for Northern Ireland so that from June  those who are shielding can now spend time outside with people from their own household or one person from another household whilst ensuring that social distancing is observed. I know that you will want to know about our plans for the future of the shielding advice. Please be assured that we are actively reviewing the shielding advice and we will provide new guidance before the end of the first shielding period.Dr McBride is also asking anyone who is shielding to take part in an engagement process which will help advise government policy on shielding in the months ahead.He added: Finally, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts during this very dficult time. The Covid- pandemic has made huge demands on many people across Northern Ireland, and I want you to know that we understand the uncertainty and upheaval that those shielding, their families and carers in particular have faced.Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening dates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have worked hard to make sure that clear signage and extra help will be there to guide them through the changes we have made to allow for social distancing.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCustomers wear masks as they shopPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCustomers wear masks as they shopWe are also asking customers to respect the measures we have put in place to help ensure shopping at Primark is an enjoyable, safe experience for everyone.This is the second time in  months that Primark has had to reopen stores in Belfast after a long absence.They began trading from their two current Belfast properties in the aftermath of the huge fire that threatened to destroy their flagship Bank Buildings premises.The damage caused by the inferno was so extensive that it forced the temporary closure of  surrounding shops and its legacy is still being felt today.

Mark Hamiliton, who is a member of Ash, and his dad, Neil, started the project a year ago and since then the customised bangles have been snapped up by fans. The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic.

Now, though, the towers begin to disappear in the blink of an eye. The coastal mist thickens and in the space of just a few minutes the castle disappears completely.That#s what the conditions along this wonderfully wild stretch of coastline can do, and why those who know the area and the dangers that walk side by side with the stunning scenery always urge caution.Dunluce Castle has stood in one form or another since the th century, a sentry on the clf edge gazing out across the ocean, but it could hardly have witnessed such tragedy over the centuries as on Tuesday evening.Four friends from Belfast, taking advantage of the fine weather. Three made it home, one body recovered from the sea below, a place known locally as The Lord#s Prayer.Today, the pathway leading down to the castle ruins remains closed, as do all our tourism attractions thanks to Covid- precautions.But the temptation of sunny weather still draws. And while the waters below might look calm and serene on a fine June day, what lurks beneath the surface, even the rocks themselves, hold dangers for even the best prepared. An unforgiving landscape.But it#s a landscape that lends itself perfectly to the popular activity of coasteering, where groups make their way along the shoreline by swimming, climbing and jumping from rocks.One wrong move can spell disaster.Coastguard Alistair Simpson said one of the group was unconscious in the water and was taken to White Rocks beach where he was pronounced dead. It#s understood the teenager who died hit his head on a rock.Coasteering around this coastline is a very popular pastime, but we would really encourage people to take part in an organised coasteering group, he said.There are groups here who organise it on a professional basis, they are properly equipped and carry our suitable risk assessments.We would always encourage anyone doing coasteering to wear suitable protective equipment - bare minimum a wetsuit, lejacket and helmet.Colleague Judith McNeice warned that even in the best of weather, the conditions can be treacherous.Although this was an absolutely beautul day, the north coast is notorious for having a large swell, even in the most benign weather, so there is a risk, even on a lovely day, for people going swimming or jumping off rocks, she said.Driving away from the sombre scene, car headlights remain useless as they only illuminate the fog. By the time you reach Ballintoy the sun is streaming through the windows, the temperature hits  degrees and it#s a beautul summer day again.That#s how quickly conditions can change and how suddenly lives can be put at risk.Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening dates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Obviously many people will be nervous, butyou can spend, do - it might save a job or two. Most of Northern Ireland#s often-criticised large public sector still have employment, as do others in IT, agriculture, etc, he said.So the advice is not to be reckless, but economies only grow and jobs are saved by spending. Soyou can, do. Maybe then we can keep less people on furlough from ending up unemployed.Speaking at an online seminar of the Association of Chartered Certied Accountants, Mr Gibson said: It will be our responsibility as citizens and as businesses to show confidence in the sectors of our economy that need it most. This will require a collective effort to go out for a meal, to buy a coffee from our local cafe and to go to the cinema when they open.He told the Belfastthat the public understandably felt powerless in the face of large-scale redundancies, including , jobs lost between aeroplane seat maker Thompson Aero and aerospace giant Bombardier. But he added: We can#t go out and buy aeroplane seats or wings, but what we can do is make those little decisions to support those restaurants, shops and cafes that might close without our support.The money you hand over to that person on the other side of the till could make the dference to whether or not that person still has that job in the future.He added putting up with queues in order to support businesses was the right thing to do. Maybe you look at the coffee shop or ice-cream shop and think you can#t be bothered queuing, he said. But that decision could be a dference between that coffee shop staying open or not. It sounds dramatic, but it#s true.Belfast Most ReadClarity call as medical chief issues letters to NI shieldersCocaine dealer Gareth #Chud# Vannan battered in Belfast#s Victoria Square after court hearingIt#s not just Linfield who have made people shirty or hot under the collar... here are some other strips that have courted controversyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Free parking to end and bus lane enforcement resumes as one further death recordedPrimark confirms Northern Ireland stores# reopening dates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At a meeting of the Western Trust Board on June , Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen provided a snapshot of community services by reading out an email from a community team leader based at Great James Street. In it the worker said: “All the publicity has been about the efforts within the hospital, and quite rightly too, but the hospital didn’t get the expected the surge from COVID-. “However, the volume of work in both our services in the community has been huge and much more intense than usual. googletag.cmd.push “I know the health visiting team are exhausted, this rate of work can’t be maintained, and we’re not going to get any relief as our services are stepping up now again.” The worker explained that staff had pulled together as a team and embraced new ways of working, at one stage managing a % reduction in staff numbers. She said: “This crisis has expedited the process of our team getting smart phones and from the feedback it has made a huge dference in being able to interact with families, especially safeguarding families. In such a short space of time. “Parents are able to send video clips to health visitors, for example to diagnose oral thrush or see the walking gait of a child. googletag.cmd.push “We set up a parents health line and looking at other ways to improve contact with families, a dedicated Facebook page in conjunction with Trust communication’s team but controlled by the health visitor team. “Parents have been emailing parents the information they require. “Our health visiting team has been working extremely hard although home visiting was reduced. Health visitors were ringing families at home with each call lasting about  to  minutes longer than a home visit might have taken.” Health visitors were contacting more families with a total of , calls for home visits completed in April for the Derry, Limavady and Strabane areas. Dr Kilgallen continued reading the email: “They start making them before am and are working consistently throughout the day, one after another which is much more intense. “They also have the worry that many of the safeguarding families are not being seen, they are being tele-linked and that’s harder and very tiring. “We had health visitor redeployed into the hospital therefore leaving vacant caseloads but those on the ground are working to cover those vacant caseloads so there isn’t a backlog.” The team leader went on to speak about the community midwery services who experienced a high volume of work with an increase in the number of antenatal bookings. They anticipate that come November-December onwards there will be a signicant workload due to lockdown. The meeting was told that , people have received help and support from community based teams, including those iniduals who were shielding. That included delivering food parcels and prescriptions, and regular telephone contact. Dr Kilgallen said she brought this feedback to board members so that they can all recognise the ‘very dedicated work’ of this team.

At a Stormont sitting this afternoon questions were put to the First Minister including one from Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan about the Magee project. Arlene Foster said The Executive Officehas reaffirmed the commitment set out in the New Decade New Approach document to establish a graduate entry medical school in Derry. Its objective now is to progress the project to secure a ‘sustainable outcome on the fastest feasible timetable’. “This is a complex project involving a number of departments and external agencies,” the First Minister said, “and TEO is currently working with the departments of health, economy and finance to prepare further advice to the Executive on the issues which need to be addressed to secure that sustainability.” googletag.cmd.push On May  Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that TEO would assume responsibility for the medical school project and on May  that it had been approved. Mark H Durkan askeda ‘cast iron guarantee’ could be given that it will be ready to accept admissions in September  and,so, what specic dates and deadlines must be met. He was told the Executive received an update from the head of the civil service yesterday. The strategic investment board are involved to ensure that any ‘risks are minimised’ around the delivery of this project, she continued. The First Minister stated: “We do not intend to make any announcement about the date of first intake until all the necessary preparation work has been completed and we very much hope that will continue at pace in TEO. googletag.cmd.push “Because as I said this is a cross-departmental issue which is why TEO stepped in to try and assist to make sure that things move smoothly.” FINANCIAL CHALLENGES UUP leader Steve Aiken said one of the key strategic partners for Magee is Ulster University and UU has been involved in ‘very signicant cost over-runs’ at its Belfast campus. “I think there are some investigations ongoing as to whether UU are actually capable of managing projects. “Therefore, can I ask the minister what confidence she has that UU are actually a suitable partner for delivering this vital project for Londonderry.” Arlene Foster responded: “Capacity and finance are clearly issues that will have to be examined as a wider look at risk management in relation to this scheme and that’s why the head of the civil service was able to give us an update yesterday.” Independent East Derry MLA Claire Sugden said she understands there has been ‘considerable capital monies committed to the Magee project’. But she queried whether the department for the economy required additional finances to resource the running and day to day costs ‘or is that something they’ll have to find within their own budget’. DUP leader Mrs Foster said the ‘financial and governance challenges’ currently facing UU will be overseen by the strategic investment board. It’s important to have that body ‘looking in at what we’re trying to achieve’ she said, ‘to give us the confidence that any risks that are identied can be managed and mitigated.’ Those matters will be taken forward but with oversight from TEO. ‘ECONOMIC DAMAGE’ The Derry News has also learned of a letter circulated to UU staff this afternoon. Professor Paul Bartholomew, Interim Vice-Chancellor at Ulster University informed colleagues about the ‘financial sustainability’ of the institution. In the correspondence he cites a dferent Higher Education funding model in NI and the Coronavirus pandemic as major obstacles. He says ‘the immediate economic damage is now becoming clear’ and ‘we need to consider the implications for us within the context of our already stretched financial position.’ “In that context, and as you would expect, we continue to closely monitor the financial trends and outlook to build a sustainable financial strategy that must address not only the financial impacts of COVID, but also the pre-existing challenge of a cost base that has grown, whilst income from government block grant and fees from capped student numbers have remained largely flat.” He makes it clear that its financial strategy is likely to necessitate staff cuts. Prof Bartholomew said: “That sustainable financial strategy has identied a number of options that may, in the near future, be put forward for decision. Representing nearly % of our total cost base, those options necessarily include staff cost reduction measures. “A full strategic review is also proposed to enable clarity around strategic priorities and associated resource allocation we understand that across the institution staff are already operating at full stretch and any decision made to achieve sustainability must, in parallel, address issues of workload and prioritisation.” He adds: “With the full support of SLT and Council, we have been engaging with the Department for the Economy and our own Trade Union colleagues, to ensure there is a full understanding of the position, this has been in advance of considering formally any possible options that offer the best solutions for staff.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, googletag.cmd.push Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. googletag.cmd.push “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”  CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Crossroads Primary School in Kilrea have enlisted the help of Pearse’s GAC for the event, which will take place at Pearse Park on Thursday, June  at .am. The ceremony will be restricted to the families of Primary  pupils only, with designated car parking spaces mapped out for each pupil. Principal Eugene Mullan said the school wanted to do something special to mark the end of the pupils’ time at Crossroads. “I was racking my brain trying to think of something that was memorable and special for the Ps. They’ve missed out on so many experiences in Term ,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “We had a residential planned and we had all the end of season tournaments were ahead of us. We had a trip just before lockdown with the Year s and the school council to Stormont and at least they had that experience and got away together. “I’d considered doing a live stream, but I saw an ad for drive-in bingo in Banagher at the weekend and thought we’d give the prizegiving a go. “At least this way, the children can all come together. They won’t get to socialise with each other the way they normally would have, but at least they’ll be able to see one another.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Mullan said the venture was something the school had never attempted before, but that dficult times need creative thinking. “It’s a first for our school and I’ve never heard of a school doing a drive-in prizegiving before,” he said. “It’s an unprecedented time, though, so we have to come up with creative solutions and try and make it some way memorable for the children. “The big screen is being set up on Thursday morning and we’ll connect up a laptop with photo presentations so everyone can see and follow on with what’s happening. “All the P cars will have a designated parking space in an arc in front of the big screen and then extended family can park in behind.” The Ballerin native said Covid- had frustrated the school’s usual work in preparing the Primary  pupils for their transition to secondary education. “In Term  we would normally talk about moving on and any concerns or anxieties the children have,” he said. “We haven’t had a chance to do any of that and they’ve missed out on open days and taster days in their new schools too. “It’s going to be a big culture shock for them, but this should be special for the boys and girls and give them a nice send off.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Crossroads Primary School in Kilrea have enlisted the help of Pearse’s GAC for the event, which will take place at Pearse Park on Thursday, June  at .am. The ceremony will be restricted to the families of Primary  pupils only, with designated car parking spaces mapped out for each pupil. Principal Eugene Mullan said the school wanted to do something special to mark the end of the pupils’ time at Crossroads. “I was racking my brain trying to think of something that was memorable and special for the Ps. They’ve missed out on so many experiences in Term ,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “We had a residential planned and we had all the end of season tournaments were ahead of us. We had a trip just before lockdown with the Year s and the school council to Stormont and at least they had that experience and got away together. “I’d considered doing a live stream, but I saw an ad for drive-in bingo in Banagher at the weekend and thought we’d give the prizegiving a go. “At least this way, the children can all come together. They won’t get to socialise with each other the way they normally would have, but at least they’ll be able to see one another.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Mullan said the venture was something the school had never attempted before, but that dficult times need creative thinking. “It’s a first for our school and I’ve never heard of a school doing a drive-in prizegiving before,” he said. “It’s an unprecedented time, though, so we have to come up with creative solutions and try and make it some way memorable for the children. “The big screen is being set up on Thursday morning and we’ll connect up a laptop with photo presentations so everyone can see and follow on with what’s happening. “All the P cars will have a designated parking space in an arc in front of the big screen and then extended family can park in behind.” The Ballerin native said Covid- had frustrated the school’s usual work in preparing the Primary  pupils for their transition to secondary education. “In Term  we would normally talk about moving on and any concerns or anxieties the children have,” he said. “We haven’t had a chance to do any of that and they’ve missed out on open days and taster days in their new schools too. “It’s going to be a big culture shock for them, but this should be special for the boys and girls and give them a nice send off.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council have revealed a packed programme for the Virtual LearningFestival, which will take place on July st and nd. Marking the citys membership of the UNESCOS Global Network of Learning Cities, the festival – which is funded by the council, North West Regional College and Ulster University - will offer a wide range of online learning experiences and activities. Events will take the form of information sessions, live presentations, short films and live chats. Ulster University will host of iety of online events, from an interactive session on robotics to a discussion around language and identity. googletag.cmd.push With recent approval from the Executive Office for the opening of Magees Graduate-Entry Medical School, medicine will also be a big focus from Ulster University, with Professor Louise Dubras, Foundation Dean of the GEMS, and Professor Tony Bjourson of C-TRIC discussing medicine in the st century. North West Regional College lecturers will host a series of online events, ranging from swing dance style combinations, health and sport activities to include tips for a healthy lestyle, first aid and holistic health, as well as online cooking demos. For those who are looking for guidance on employment, Craft Training will be providing information sessions on creating a CV and interview skills, and will also provide tutorials on construction and catering. googletag.cmd.push With many people now spending a lot more time at home, the Virtual Learning Festival will also focus on technology and how it can be utilised in many dferent ways.

The North West Japanese Cultural Group will look at Japanese folktale in Irish and creating origami paper crafts. The Cedar Foundation will deliver an important presentation on disability awareness. Participants can also develop their skills in the kitchen with a lesson in making pizza dough and Italian basics from UA, or some crazy kitchen science from STEM Aware. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Brian Tierney, said the range of events really captured the essence of what learning is about for all ages. Looking at the wonderful and wide-ranging programme that has been put in place for this festival is extremely exciting – there really is something for everyone and I think it has been adapted really well to fit in with the current climate in taking the festival online. We can all do with learning new things, whether its a new skill or education on really important issues like disability awareness or the role medicine plays in our society. This programme celebrates everyone, from our young children to our students, and the adults out there as well – its never too late to learn! Our current situation can be overwhelming and frustrating at times, and this festival offers the perfect solution, by picking up new skills and information, and by utilising technology in a way that we may never have needed before.” More details about the festival are available on the councils website.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area. Contractors then moved to Pound Lane and are now in St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Eleanor Telford, who owns Telrsquos Confectionary with her husband Alan, said that she believed that the pipe-laying would start outside her shop imminently.ldquoI suppose the work has to be done sometime and perhaps itrsquos better done now when things are still quiet, but I hope the work is completed within the time we have been told, she said.Motorists have faced some delays in St Patrickrsquos Avenue which feeds into Market Street, the townrsquos main shopping area.Phoenix hopes that by expediting its multi-million pound investment programme now, it will avoid further disruption later in the year, while also providing consumers with additional access to fuel choice before the winter period.The company insists that the safety of its staff and communities is of paramount importance, with the current pipe-laying work scheduled following ldquorobust risk assessment and the implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran also appealed to Phoenix to complete the work as quickly as possible and for road users to remain patient during the work in the town centre which he said will result in inconvenience.He said it was always anticipated the work on such a major investment in towns and villages across the district would result in some degree of disruption and inconvenience.Cllr Curran said that the arrival of natural gas provides consumers with an added element of choice when it comes to their heating needs and said the investment in Downpatrick and right across the district opens up new opportunities to thousands of homeowners and the townrsquos business community.ldquoPipe-laying on such a large scale along congested streets and town centres results in disruption and while issues have arisen in the past, Phoenix has always done it best to minimise disruption, he said.ldquoBringing forward the work in Downpatrick, especially as schools across the town are closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown measures, makes sense. However, there will be concern about this project across the business community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Sam helping lift spirits with nursing home gigs  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH musician is lting the spirits of residents at a local nursing home mdash despite the Coronavirus lockdown and heart surgery.For over  years Sam Miskelly has been entertaining the residents of Fishbourne House at Spa, with his accordion.However, his weekly visits were put on hold after he underwent heart surgery several months ago and had stents fitted.He recovered only for the Covid- virus to spread around the globe, which meant he was no longer to go inside the home.Undaunted, the  year-old former lorry driver now sets up his accordion, amplier and microphone in the garden of the nursing home and residents are still able to enjoy his tuneful medleys.Sam is a regular performer at old tyme dances at a number of local venues and it was at one of them where he met Mr William Brown, owner of Fishbourne House.ldquoOne night he asked meI would play music for the residents.

Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

Itrsquos understanding it.Oriel College said the commission will be chaired by Carole Souter, the current master of St Cross College and former chief executive of the National Lottery Heritage Fund.A report for the governing body will be produced by the end of the year.On Wednesday, the Rhodes Must Fall campaign said the group is ldquooptimistic following the decision but urged the college to commit to removing the statue.ldquoHowever, we have been down this route before, where Oriel College has committed to taking a certain action, but has not followed through: notably, in , when the college committed to engaging in a six-month-long democratic listening exercise, a statement by the campaign said.ldquoTherefore, while we remain hopeful, our optimism is cautious.ldquoWhile the governing body of Oriel College have lsquoexpressed their wishrsquo to take down the statue, we continue to demand their commitment.Alan Rusbridger, principal of the universityrsquos Lady Margaret Hall and former editor-in-chief of thenewspaper, said it is the ldquoright decision and the start of a ldquolonger conversation at Oxford. vw,vw,px, px\"Oxford City Council said it would welcome the early submission of a planning application from Oriel College to accompany the review process Susan Brown, the leader of Oxford City Council, also welcomed the move and said the Rhodes Must Fall campaign is a ldquobig step closer to achieving its aim.She said the council would welcome the early submission of a planning application from Oriel College to accompany the review process.Earlier on Wednesday, universities minister Michelle Donelan called campaigns to remove the statue ldquoshort-sighted.Demonstrations have taken place outside Oriel College, calling for the statue to be removed from the High Street entrance of the building, as well as anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd in the US.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK should be careful not to ldquoairbrush its history, but should ldquoupdate it.He told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoI think we should be very careful not to airbrush our history but to use statues and monuments as a point of debate.ldquoBut one thing I do accept is that people will think that we ought to keep updating our history, and make sure the symbols reflect the spirit and the values of the age..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: College us desire to remove Cecil Rhodes statue met with  ucautious u optimism article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He suggested that in these exceptional circumstances quick decisions are essential to suit local issues.“This is highlighted by the recent decision by the Minister for Infrastructure to ask councils to relax the rules for on-street cafes and bars and also the Department’s investigation into potential widening of pavements to help with social distancing.”“The decision to provide more flexibility on pavement use is welcomed, subject to ensuring disabled access is maintained, and greater pedestrianisation is something that is increasingly seen as a way to help revitalise our towns. But without visibility of these decisions or the processes, timescales and likelihood of funding it is extremely dficult to plan.”“I believe that strategic planning of transport, funding decisions and the development of our townscapes will have a huge bearing on the success of our economic recovery. For example, I believe that a new railway station and park and ride facility in the Rushmere area of Craigavon could create an economic development and sustainable transport hub which would benefit the wider area, including those travelling from Armagh.”“Connectivity is key and enhanced transport links with Belfast and Dublin, the strategic development of the A corridor in Banbridge, and sustainable linkages to build our tourism sector could create new jobs and opportunities. Successfully connecting people and places.”“However, the correct powers and funding decisions are needed to deliver any strategic plan and vision.”“A closer partnership arrangement between councils and the Executive Departments would be a good start. But in these unprecedented times, where pressure is building on businesses, jobs and our citizens there could well be a clamour for greater local control.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
