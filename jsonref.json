Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that the ban, pending government approval, would last 14 days. Israel, the first country to shut its borders completely over the Omicron variant, has so far confirmed one case of the variant and seven other suspected cases. The four additional countries are Malawi, Mozambique, Angola and Zambia, Reuters reports. The ban excludes Bahraini citizens and those with Bahraini residency visa holders, it said. Bahrain on Friday banned entry to travellers from South Africa and five other southern African nations.A statement released by the Rugby Football Union revealed that four players and two members of staff from the invitational side had tested positive for Covid-19. The scrapping of the game followed last year’s fixture against England being called off after 13 players broke the Covid protocols, leading to widespread condemnation of the players’ behaviour. With the government announcing on Saturday that the first UK cases of the Omicron variant had been detected, the former head of the government’s vaccine taskforce said he could see no evidence that his blueprint for tackling the most worrying variants – submitted in the spring – had been acted upon. In response, a government spokesperson said: “This past year we’ve witnessed unprecedented scientific innovations and breakthroughs, made possible by collaboration between medical experts, governments and industry. “Earlier this year, we joined the 100 Days Mission, which will ensure industry is part of a robust collaboration alongside governments, international organisations and academia over the coming months and years to take action towards a common goal: protecting people from future pandemics through developing and deploying safe, targeted and effective diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines at scale.”“The action to ban flights from the most affected countries is never a decision that should be taken lightly, but for a brief period it can buy the time needed to better understand the threat posed by this new variant and ensure the implementation of more robust identification and targeted contact tracing for iniduals arriving from those countries now placed on the red list. “The decision by the government to reimplement the need for a PCR test from all iniduals arriving in the UK from abroad on day two, with self-isolation until a negative test is reported, while frustrating for those travelling, is essential in order to rapidly identify cases of infection with the Omicron variant and implement prompt isolation and targeted contact tracing to limit the spread of the variant in the UK. “The decision to implement a requirement to wear face masks on public transport and in shops is welcomed, and while it is not yet a requirement to wear them in other environments, the British public would be wise to consider wearing them in all circumstances when they are indoors with gatherings of anyone other than close family and friends.” The speed at which Omicron’s initial discovery has led to the detection of cases around the world and the imposition of new restrictions has been startling. It is also a sign of desperation in Downing Street to avoid a lapse back into more severe restrictions, such as those the prime minister was forced to introduce – with great reluctance – last Christmas. The two people with the variant entered Germany at Munich airport on 24 November, before South Africa was designated a virus variant area, and were now isolating, said Bavaria’s health ministry. The two had come forward for further investigations after they heard about the new variant, Reuters reports. The Bavarian ministry said anyone who had been in South Africa in the last 14 days should immediately reduce contacts, take a PCR test and contact their local health authority. “Bavaria has responded early and quickly to the very new variant,” a ministry spokesperson said. “Everything must be done to stop it spreading.” Of passengers arriving from Cape Town on Friday, 50 are in quarantine in Bavaria.  Earlier, officials in the western state of Hesse, home to Frankfurt airport which is one of Europe’s busiest airports, said a suspected case of the Omicron variant had been found in a passenger arriving from South Africa. “In a number of the tested persons the Omicron variant is presumed to have been found,” the Netherlands Institute for Health (RIVM) said. A spokesperson for the RIVM said it was “almost certain” the cases were of the new variant but further testing is needed, Reuters reports.Rickman is one of many Australians frustrated by New Zealand’s gradual border reopening timeline, which keeps Australians out until at least 30 April. Under the plan, fully vaccinated New Zealanders currently in Australia will be able to return home without quarantine from 17 January. But fully vaccinated non-citizens won’t be able to enter the country until 30 April next year, and they will still need to isolate for a week. The countries are South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zambia and Malawi, Reuters reports. The genome was sequenced at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergency Diagnostics of the Sacco Hospital in Milan from a positive sample of a patient coming from Mozambique. The patient and his family contacts were in good health, the ISS said, adding that the sequence of the sample, “attributable to the one now known as variant of concern (VOC) and defined yesterday by WHO as Omicron”, was in the process of further confirmation.“Evidence shows they help stop the virus spreading, and this is a measure I’ve repeatedly urged the Government to take.”Johnson said anyone arriving in the UK will be asked to take a PCR test for Covid-19 on the second day and must self-isolate until they provide a negative test. The rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will also be tightened, he said. Contacts of all confirmed cases of people infected with the Omicron variant will have to self-isolate for 10 days. Health officials are also examining the case for widening access to the booster vaccine programme, he added. The CDC raised its travel recommendation to “Level Four: Very High” for South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana while the state department issued parallel “Do Not Travel” advisories on Saturday.A spokesperson said: “We have repeatedly raised our concerns with the UK Government about its decision to relax international travel rules quickly, precisely because of the risk of introducing new variants into the UK. We also warned against the removal of PCR tests for returning travellers. “The emergence of this new variant is a serious development in the ongoing pandemic and reinforces the need for everyone in Wales to get their vaccine or booster when offered, wear face coverings when necessary, and book a test if they develop symptoms.” "},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland to review uk requirement for passenger pcr test","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.

That might include a decision to follow the UK’s lead requiring all incoming passengers to take a PCR test upon arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. However, that possibility has yet to be discussed by senior ministers and public health advisers.It is also understood that work is also being done this weekend on a new passenger locator form for people arriving into Irish territory. This will ensure that the original place of travel is included in the form. None of the seven countries in Southern Africa which originally notified cases of the new variant have direct flights into Ireland.It comes following the announcement that legislation is being prepared to reintroduce mandatory hotel quarantine. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Saturday it would be the first item on the agenda at the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Saturday it would be the first item on the agenda at the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday.Nphet statementIn a statement issued on Saturday night, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) said it was aware of new cases of Omicron in the UK, Italy, Germany and Belgium even though it has not been formally notified by European Alert Systems as yet.“The Nphet Epidemiological Team are meeting regularly over the weekend to monitor the situation and are currently considering further required measures,” it said.It added that a series of initial measures have been put in place to mitigate against the arrival of this variant to Ireland.“The situation regarding this new variant will be kept under continuous review by all relevant bodies.”Measures currently in place include the emergency brake for travel to and from the seven countries of concern in respect of the variant.The Department of Foreign Affairs has changed its travel advisory to “avoid non-essential travel” to these countries. Irish residents returning home from these countries will be required to undergo strict home quarantine regardless of vaccine status or recovery status. They will also need to undergo PCR testing during quarantine.“Regulations are being drawn up urgently to give effect to the new travel and home quarantine policies,” said the Nphet statement.“The Department of Justice is arranging increased BMU spot-checking of passengers on arrival.”Nphet also confirmed that mandatory hotel quarantine options are being examined on a contingency basis.‘Emergency brake’On Friday, the Irish Government followed the European Union in agreeing to implement an “emergency brake” on arrivals from seven southern African countries.Mr Ryan also said the Department of Foreign Affairs was working with a “small number” of people in southern Africa who were trying to get back to Ireland following the travel restrictions.Mr Ryan said there were limited options available for people with the airlines and the department was looking at chartering a plane to repatriate these people.Mr Ryan said news of the Omicron variant was a shock and one of the most disheartening recent developments in the pandemic.“I’ll be honest, I was frightened yesterday. It was a blow. I was thinking if we get these boosters out in the next few weeks we’ll be in better shape, and we will.”He said it was not clear yet if this new variant was more transmissible or was able to bypass some of the protections offered by vaccines.Asked if the Cabinet would consider other restrictions in addition to mandatory quarantine, Mr Ryan said the truth was that a lot of what has been done will have to be continued.Under the restrictions announced on Friday, people arriving into Ireland from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique will have to present “not-detected” pre-flight PCR result, regardless of vaccination status, and quarantine at home for 10 days, undergoing a further two PCR tests.Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane said it was accepted the Omicron variant was a real concern and there was a need to move fast.A spokesperson for the department said it was providing consular assistance to Irish citizens who had requested it.

But the gap between our positions is still significant and we are ready to use Article 16 to protect the Belfast Agreement if other solutions cannot be found,” Mr Frost said in a statement after meeting European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in London on Friday.“A decisive push is needed to ensure predictability,” Mr Sefcovic said on Twitter after the meeting with Mr Frost. “We’ll meet again next week.” The two sides are seeking to break the deadlock over the implementation of the protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. EU and Irish officials had been concerned that the British government was moving towards triggering Article 16 earlier this month, but momentum appeared to dissipate as the EU warned it would have a severe impact on trade and UK prime minister Boris Johnson faced political trouble at home over a sleaze scandal.Talks between officials from both sides on technical aspects of customs and other arrangements are due to continue throughout the coming week.The EU has been keen to nail down a deal covering medicines, but has found agreement from the UK side to be elusive.There are concerns that time is tight and that a deal on medicines would need to be reached soon in order for the EU to change its laws in time to avoid disruption after the end of this year.A grace period for border checks and regulatory approvals for medicines is due to expire at the end of December and the EU had proposed adjusting its rules to counter any potential disruption to supply.But in order to be in place by the end of the year, the EU had hoped to begin its internal approval procedures in the coming week.Earlier this week, Mr Sefcovic warned that his previously expressed hopes that a deal could be reached before January were “probably too ambitious”.“I think that if there was the clear political will from the UK side these... problems could be solved,” he told Politico. “But looking at how far we progressed over the last four weeks, the level of detail our UK partners want to discuss, I know that we will probably not be able to resolve everything before the end of the year.” How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillPolitical Correspondent Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said that emergence of new variants will mean that, for the foreseeable future, Irish people will have “to learn to live with Covid-19 pending a successful global eradication campaign”. In his keynote address to the party’s annual convention, Mr Ryan began by speaking of the new variant of concern that has emerged in southern Africa in recent days, saying it was a worrying development but that it would ultimately be addressed by vaccines.“I know the TV news bulletins might be alarming but please remember that there are several reasons to remain hopeful,” Mr Ryan, who is also Minister for Climate Change, Communications and Transport told delegates.“While the new variant may prove to be more contagious, our best scientists expect that the vaccines will still provide us with protection. What we need to do now is to accelerate the booster programme here at home, and ensure the whole world gets access to vaccines at urgent speed. The only way to stop this disease in its tracks is to have a co-ordinated global approach,” he said.He said the people would have to learn to live with Covid until the worldwide vaccination campaign had completed.However, he said that people would have to be allowed “to enjoy a normal social life because that too is vital for our health and wellbeing”.The party’s intention had been to hold this year’s convention in the Aviva Stadium but it migrated online once the Government’s advice changed earlier this month in the face of the deteriorating Covid-19 situation.Green policiesThe main theme of Mr Ryan’s speech, and also that of deputy leader Catherine Martin, was that the time for action on Green policies in Government is now. He said that not alone had Green policies been approved by the Government, but they were beginning to be implemented.“We are talking the talk but increasingly we are walking the walk,” he said. “There are challenges ahead, of course. Will there be missteps along the way? Absolutely.“But we will learn as we go and we will emerge as a cleaner, greener, happier Ireland. We can do this and we will. The time is now,” he said.In her speech, Ms Martin said the Greens in Government must move faster and be more courageous in their actions.“Institutions, by their nature, don’t change quickly, but the Green Party knows and recognises the urgency to change course.“The old system is built for the old world. It cannot be business as usual.“And if our institutions can’t get what needs to be done, then let’s never accept no for an answer,” said Ms Martin, who is also Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.She said that the world needed new visions, new leaders and change-makers.She said the Green Party needed to constantly push the boundaries and challenge the status quo.She also said people were demanding the Greens “must do better”.Mr Ryan and Ms Martin argued that the Green Party had achieved a lot in its first 18 months in Government in all of its key areas, including climate change, the environment, bioersity, the arts and tourism (including supports during Covid), children, housing and health.Now, I know there are some people at home who may not share the Green Party’s passion for climate action and who wonder whether it’s all worth it,” said Mr Ryan in his address.“For those listening at home, let me say that the risk isn’t from taking action – the real risk is from standing back and doing nothing at all.Transition“For this new green economy is the one that is emerging across the world. It is an inevitable transition because under business as usual, the world will simply burn…“It is a transition requiring such scale and speed that it needs every person and every place to be involved, which is one of the reasons we have to make sure it is a just transition.”In terms of action, Mr Ryan said a million euro would be spent on active travel every day. He said there would be proposals brought to the Government in the next few weeks to electrify the Maynooth rail line and to order 95 battery electric train carriages for Irish Rail. He said the Bus Connects and Dublin  projects will be brought to Cabinet in the first quarter of next year.He said that under new clean-air regulations there would be no further sales of inefficient solid home-heating fuels from next autumn and that auctions for offshore wind would begin about the same time.“This isn’t all just aspiration by the way, we are already doing this.“We are world leaders at integrating renewable electricity and are well placed to deliver the solar and wind power we have in abundance,” he said.

Photograph:  Phill MagakoeAFPGettyBritain, Germany and Italy detected cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday and British prime minister Boris Johnson announced new steps to contain the virus, while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa. The two linked cases of the new variant detected in Britain were connected to travel to southern Africa, British health minister Sajid Javid said. Speaking later, Johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings. “We will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result,” Johnson told a news conference. People who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of Omicron would have to self-isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings, Johnson said, adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks. EuropeThe health ministry in the German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant. The two people entered Germany at Munich airport on November 24th, before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and were now isolating, said the ministry, indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from South Africa. In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique. Czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in Namibia. Omicron, dubbed a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation, is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe Covid-19 compared with other strains. The variant was first discovered in South Africa and had also since been detected in Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong. Dutch health authorities have said 61 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid-19, and tests for the Omicron variant among the people infected were being conducted.About 600 passengers arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on the two KLM flights on Friday and then faced hours of delays and testing due to concerns over the new virus variant.Meanwhile, a number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an “increased risk of reinfection” and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a “growth advantage”.Travel curbsAlthough epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally, many countries around the world – including the United States, Brazil, Canada and European Union nations – announced travel bans or restrictions on southern Africa on Friday. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department added on Saturday to Washington’s previously announced travel restrictions, advising against travel to eight southern African countries. Also on Saturday, Australia said it would ban non-citizens who have been in nine southern African countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens returning from there. Japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more African countries after imposing curbs on travel from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho on Friday. Britain also said it was expanding its “red list” to put travel curbs on more southern Africa countries, while South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Kuwait and Hungary announced travel restrictions on southern African nations. South Africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"pcr tests required for passengers arriving into uk after omicron variant detected","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.

Photograph: Hollie AdamsPoolAFPGettyBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus including mandatory masks in shops and PCR tests for travellers entering the UK after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.Amid mounting global concern over Omicron, named a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation on Friday, the prime minister set out a series of steps the UK is taking to maximise its defence against Covid-19.The Irish Government is to review the steps taken by the UK government against the new Covid-19 Omicron variant, which requires all travellers entering the State take a PCR test by the second day of arrival. A source said that advice was not to follow the UK lead for the moment but to await the outcome of a series of high-level discussions over the next few days on the best approach.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said anyone arriving in the UK will be asked to take a PCR test for Covid-19 on the second day and must self-isolate until they provide a negative test.The rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will also be tightened, he said.Contacts of all confirmed cases of people infected with the Omicron variant will have to self-isolate for 10 days. Health officials are also examining the case for widening access to the booster vaccine programme, he added. The measures will be reviewed in three weeks.Omicron is potentially more contagious than previous variants, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more severe illness. Mr Johnson warned it could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, as he announced a strengthening of England’s rules after two cases were identified in Nottingham and Brentwood in Essex.Booster campaignIn an effort to slow the spread, Mr Johnson announced “temporary and precautionary” measures to be reviewed in three weeks, alongside an expansion of the vaccine booster campaign.Mr Johnson said he remained confident that this Christmas “will be considerably better than last Christmas”. Asked about the prospect for this year’s festivities, the prime minister said: “We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout and I think I’m going to stick with the formula I’ve used before, which is I’m pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas.”The measures announced fall short of the government’s plan B, which involves advice to work from home and the use of vaccine passports. However, the UK may need to “face up” to the possibility of further action if the Omicron variant is very transmissible, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said.He said: “I think we’ll get more information on transmissibility, we’ll get more information on the ability of the vaccines to protect against the virus, but that’s going to take a little bit of time.“At the moment, the models are more ‘if it spreads very fast, of course it’s going to spread very fast and go into a lot of places, and if it spreads less fast it’s going to do so less’.“But if it’s very transmissible and does cause a big escape, then clearly that’s a major issue we have to face up to. But that isn’t what we know at the moment, we need to get that information.”Prof Chris Whitty told the press conference it was “inevitable” the Omicron variant will spread across the world over the next few days. England’s chief medical officer said that while it is clear Omicron is highly transmissible, it is not yet known how effective the vaccine will be as protection against it – but said those who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill.Red listEarlier on Saturday Sajid Javid, the health secretary, announced that the UK was adding four more southern African nations to the travel red list after two cases of the new variant were detected in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex.The UK Health Security Agency confirmed the cases, which are believed to be connected and linked to travel from southern Africa, after genomic sequencing overnight. The iniduals and their households were ordered into self-isolation and targeted testing was being carried out in areas where they are thought to have been infectious.Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will face travel restrictions from Sunday. Javid said “this is a real reminder that this pandemic is far from over” as he urged people to get their vaccines, including boosters.“We were concerned from the moment we first identified this new variant,” he added. He said anyone who has travelled in the last 10 days to the countries now on the red list, which also includes South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia, must self-isolate and take PCR tests.The UK is the second European nation to have reported the presence of Omicron after Belgium said it had identified a single case on Friday. In the Netherlands authorities said 61 people tested positive for Covid-19 arriving on two flights from South Africa on Friday. Further tests are under way to determine if any of them had the Omicron variant.It was unclear when the two iniduals in the UK were infected, or their full travel history, as countries scrambled to close their borders to much of southern Africa. Ministers said non-UK and non-Irish residents who have been in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola in the previous 10 days will be refused entry into England from 4am on Sunday. Those who are permitted to return will be ordered to isolate in a government-approved facility for 10 days.Risk of reinfectionNumerous pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron after the WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the variant has an increased risk of reinfection and may spread more rapidly than other strains.Commenting on two cases of the Omicron Covid variant being detected in the UK, Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine, Imperial College London, said: “There is no need to get alarmed, but we do need to be prepared and to take rapid action.“It is better to act fast but be prepared to change as new information comes in. Travel restrictions may slow the rate of growth and buy time to establish the important facts about severity, immune evasion, transmission and susceptibility to treatment and prevention.”Openshaw added: “With or without this new variant, Delta is already a crisis in many parts of Europe and still causing a lot of illness and death in the UK, especially in those not vaccinated or in those who do not respond to vaccines.” – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"easy cynical quietly making success brexit","story":"Sir Robert Peel once remarked that public opinion is a compound of folly, weakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs. I’m not so cynical, but any of us who followed the Brexit debate over the last few years could certainly see his views reflected in some of the downbeat corners of the media. All too often, the negative angle taken about our leaving the European Union can feel pessimistic, particularly for those of us who see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to regain our nation’s sovereignty. Our successes are often denied the space they deserve, while challenges — real or imagined — are seized upon and blown up into headlines. For the first time in fifty years, the United Kingdom is an independent trading nation with a government answerable only to the British people. Any big change brings challenges, yes, but to focus solely on them is not only wrong, but means that our tangible successes don’t get a look-in.One area that often flies under the radar is the work we’re doing to open up markets all around the world, beyond trade deals.As we said when launching our Export Strategy last week, research shows firms that export are more productive, more profitable and pay higher wages on average than those that don’t. And there is, understandably, huge appetite for high-quality British goods and services worldwide, making it mutually beneficial. That’s why the Department for International Trade is working flat out to give British businesses the opportunity to sell their brilliant goods and services around the planet more easily than ever before — positioning us to take advantage of the markets of tomorrow and unleashing the UK\u0027s full potential.  That means cutting through unnecessary red tape and working with our trading partners across the world to set the conditions in which British businesses can thrive. This can be tricky, and it can take some time. But, for the country, it’s worth it.   Last year, we opened up access for major names like Diageo and Waitrose, as well as iconic Jersey dairy products and Scotch whisky. We clarified labelling requirements to achieve greater access to Jordan’s £2.5 billion food import market, and worked with Indian counterparts to increase permitted investment in their insurance market by a whopping 25 per cent, supporting British firms to grow their share of a market worth over £4 billion.  In Colombia, we worked with authorities to support development of ambitious environmental regulations that will support green investments from British firms. In Japan, we helped ensure British sausages could be marketed and sold appropriately.   The list goes on. I’m proud to say that figures published yesterday show we successfully resolved a total of 217 trade barriers across 74 countries – up 20 per cent on last year’s total. So much for the doubters, doomsters and gloomsters.  We must never forget just how much the UK has to offer as the world’s second largest services exporter and fifth largest economy. We have agreed trade deals with 70 countries — plus the EU — worth £766 billion. No other nation has secured so many trade deals with so many of its counterparts in such a short space of time. And this is just the beginning. We are making headway in dynamic economies around the world, and we have shaken hands on agreements with our good friends in Australia and New Zealand.   This paves the way for our accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (sometimes called CPTPP), a truly enormous free trade area with a combined GDP well in excess of £8 trillion last year. This Indo-Pacific tilt will hitch us to a fast-growing, dynamic region that we could do so much more with. We’re making great progress in our ground-breaking Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. And we are preparing to begin trade negotiations with India, which is projected to be the world’s third largest economy by 2050.  The opportunities available to a newly independent United Kingdom are all but limitless. In charge of our own destiny, we will bulldoze more and more trade barriers, and sign even more deals in the years and decades to come, giving our brilliant British businesses the freedom to look beyond the horizon and seize the opportunities out there.Ranil Jayawardena MP is Minister for International TradeMore from NewsWhy the omicron Covid variant is the most concerning so farPeerages should be awarded on points rather than nepotism, urges Boris Johnson\u0026#39s anti-corruption tsarPrince to turn on charm in Barbados after BLM \u0026#39lit spark\u0026#39 to cast off QueenBritish researchers to be given \u0026#39safety net\u0026#39 after EU funding fails to materialiseEastern leg of HS2 scrapped before formal value for money analysis was calculatedBBC documentary claims palace ‘senior source’ helped in war against SussexesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"every cat owner knows kitty psychopath","story":"A new “puss personality test” to check whether or not your cat is a psychopath has given me paws for thought.Researchers from the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University have come up with CAT-Tri+ – the first ever tool to measure the extent of your moggy’s nutbaggery.Apparently, cats that sit in high places, torment their prey rather than killing it, purr when attacking people and dominate the neighbourhood as well as the home, are the pet equivalent of Ted Bundy.Without wishing to set the cat among the pigeons, doesn’t this description apply to all kitties?

Those who are identied as being at risk will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government said.The Prime Minister said: This is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new iant and maximises our defences. A tweet from the PMaposs office said: COVID UPDATE: All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. They will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace.  Earlier today officials confirmed the first to Omicron cases in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham, forcing the PM to act. In a press conference from Downing Street, he also announced that all arrivals to the UK will face mandatory PCR tests. The Prime Minister added border measures can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport, Mr Johnson said.  While the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron is currently unclear, Mr Johnson said there are good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. He said weaposre going to boost the booster campaign by asking the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationto consider giving boosters to as wide a group as possible as well as reducing the gap between second doses and the booster. Professor Chris Whitty said it is inevitable the Omicron iant will spread across the world over the next few days. Englandaposs chief medical officer said while it is clear Omicron is highly transmissible, it is not yet clear how effective the vaccine will be as protection against it - but said those who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccine makers are already looking at how they can make them more effective against emerging iants, and that a jab designed to specically target the Omicron iant could be created in about  days.  He told the Downing Street press conference: I think itaposs important to recognise there are three ways in which this can be done and the companies are thinking about this. The first is the boosters will give high enough antibody coverage that actually thataposs going to be enough to cover this. Thataposs the first situation and needs to be tested. But that looks like something that anyway is going to give protection, whether thereaposs more needed on top of that weaposll have to see. The second is that vaccine manufacturers have been producing broader vaccines anyway to get broader coverage across potential new iants. So those are in the pipeline. Then a couple of companies have already said they could tweak their existing vaccines and get a new vaccine out specically against this in about  days. Those are the sort of three scenarios, clearly the one which is the one to really go for now is boost, because it is the case that as you keep boosting the vaccine, you get slightly broader coverage because the immune system knows it needs to get broader. Because the antibody levels are so high, it actually causes enough coverage of other iants to be effective. He added it is expected the iant will spread.

Ron Roberts says the summons is the “final insult” to his partner, Judy Mason after a “catalogue of problems” with the local authority dating back several years. Judy had several chronic health issues and was registered blind and Ron said previous issues with the council involved waiting two years for bathroom renovations on their home.They were also in dispute over Judy’s care package, which Ron told the Liverpool Echo was a huge burden on her le.As a result of the disputes Judy had with Sefton Council, she had refused to pay her Council Tax since .  He said she was “waiting for her day in court” to explain how she felt about the way she was treated by the council and expecting a summons. But in June this year she went in for surgery to remove a toe, and after a number of delays to her surgery due to the pandemic and contracted Covid while in hospital. Ron said: “She was very poorly and she survived it, I used to sit outside the Covid ward in the Royal speaking to her over the phone. It was a very scary time.” Judy was then transferred to Aintree Hospital for rehabilitation, where she suffered a series of bleeds on the brain and died as Ron held her hand on September .  Since then Ron says his “world has fallen apart” and he has struggled to deal with the grief of losing his partner of  years. When he opened a letter addressed to his partner seeking a court summons for Judy’s unpaid council tax it “just added to the devastation.” He said: “It was the final insult to Judy, after everything they put her through. “We were ignored for years by Sefton Council, so she made a stand about how she had been treated and refused to pay Council Tax.  Ron claims Sefton Council had been informed of her death before the letter had been sent out and receiving it has made him “feel like giving up.” He said: “It just feels like the odds were stacked against us and now she’s gone. “We were treated like dirt, Judy was treated like that in le and now she is in her death too. “They were definitely aware she is dead.

People ing to the UK from those countries will have to quarantine. Mr Brown said health leaders had given the Government repeated warnings that new iants could develop due to a lack of vaccines for poorer countries. Writing for the , Mr Brown said: In the absence of mass vaccination, Covid is not only spreading uninhibited among unprotected people but is mutating, with new iants emerging out of the poorest countries and now threatening to unleash themselves on even fully vaccinated people in the richest countries in the world.  Fewer than % of people in Africa have been fully immunised against Covid- and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose. Those conditions can speed up the spread of the virus, offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous iant. Mr Brown wrote: The figure exceeds % in both high-income countries and upper-middle-income countries. Every day, for every vaccine delivered as first vaccine in the poorest countries, six times as many doses are being administered as third and booster vaccines in the richest parts of the world.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mr Brown said the UKaposs failure to deliver  million vaccines, of which it has so far donated %, is probably the biggest international public policy failure of our times.  He added the decision will come back to haunt our own country, and said: The problem is there are enough vaccines to go around. We will have  billion vaccines by the end of the year which is enough to vaccinate the whole world. They are being unequally distributed. We have set aside vaccines for boosters and young people and there are still spare vaccines for other countries. We are depriving people the chance to survive the virus by denying the chance in so many countries to get the vaccines. His thoughts were echoed by Dr Osman Dar, project director at One Health Project, who said: The emergence of a new Covid- iant with all its myriad mutations is not unexpected. What it highlights are the continuing and fundamental risks to everyone associated with not seriously addressing the inequalities still at play globally in the fight against disease and poor health. He added that the travel ban has economically penalised, socially ostracised and socio-politically stigmatised the countries on the red list even though they did the right thing through their timely reporting and sharing of the iantaposs genetic data. Dr Dar added: Whataposs necessary, to limit the negative socio-economic impacts of these restrictive measures on trade and travel, is to have a sufficiently resourced global regime in place. This should support countries reporting new iants through the signicant financial and social hardships that then ensue - a disaster or pandemic fund specically engineered around the impacts of trade and travel restrictions.

Boris Johnson announced theof mandatory face masks in shops and public transport, tighter restrictions on arrivals in the UK and  day self-isolation for anyone who has been in contact with a suspected Omicron case.But Sir Patrick warned that might not be enough to tackle the new iant, first identied in southern Africa this week,it is very transmissible. He told the Downing Street press conference: I think weaposll get more information on transmissibility, weaposll get more information on the ability of the vaccines to protect against the virus, but thataposs going to take a little bit of time. At the moment, the models are more apos it spreads very fast, of course itaposs going to spread very fast and go into a lot of places, andit spreads less fast itaposs going to do so lessapos. Butitaposs very transmissible and does cause big escape, then clearly thataposs a major issue we have to face up to. But that isnapost what we know at the moment, we need to get that information.  The PM warned the new iant, seen for the first time on Tuesday in southern Africa, spreads more easily, and could be more resistant to vaccinations - even spreading betwen two double vaccinated people. The Prime Minister opened a Number  press conference by saying: Apologies for disturbing your Saturday.He said face covering rules in shops and on public transport would be tightened up. He later claried this would mean you have to wear them in retail settings or on public transport, but that Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, would give more detail in the course of the next day or so. The official Number  Twitter account then claried this would not include hospitality settings like pubs and restaurants.And people who have been in contact with people suspected of having the Omicron iant will have to self-isolate for ten days, regardless of their vaccine status. He also announced all arrivals in the UK would have to take a PCR test by day two after entering the country, and isolate until their results are in. Weaposre not going to stop people travelling, I want to stress that, weaposre not going to stop people travelling, but we will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result, he said.  Second, we need to slow down the spread of this iant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together. We will require all contacts of those who test positive with a suspected case of Omicron to self-isolate for  days regardless of your vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport. And he said the government would boost the booster campaign, in a bid to fight the iant. He said: We donapost yet exactly know how effective our vaccines will be against Omicron but we have good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. If youaposre boosted, your response is likely to be stronger so itaposs more vital than ever that people get their jabs and we get those boosters into arms as fast as possible. The PM said all the new measures would be temporary and reviewed in three weeks.

The Home Secretary appointed Dan OaposMahoney, a dashing former Commando, to get a grip on small boat channel crossings in August .But the governmentaposs disastrous handling of the migrant crisis after Brexit has led to record crossings - and little is known of what Mr OaposMahoney has achieved.When he was appointed aposClandestine Channel Threat Commanderapos - a role which was never existed before his arrival - the Home Office said his job as to bring together  agencies involved in security in the channel. The Home Office wonapost say how much heaposs paid - only that employees are paid in accordance with their pay grade. Theyaposve failed to disclose how he got the job, and how many people were considered for it. And no details of his team appeared in the departmentaposs annual report this year, beyond noting that he had been appointed.Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour ’s Shadow Home Secretary said: “On the same day the Home Secretary appointed the Clandestine Channel Threat Commander she said that she wanted to make the dangerous Channel crossing ‘unviable’.“Since then, the Home Secretary has failed to get a grip of this crisis, and has been secretive about the Threat Commander role, its funding and how many people work in the unit. She must now come clean about how it is operating. “Yet more empty rhetoric is not helping the situation.”  Announcing the news of his appointment in August , the Home Office noted Mr OaposMahoney as a trustees of a military charity concerned with mental health support and resettlement into civilian le. The charity - known as the Royal Marines Club, formerly Commando  - has raised almost three quarters of a million since . But the body has failed to submit accounts to the Charity Commission since  - and current documents are  days past their submission deadline. And while Mr OaposMahoney has told MPs he makes regular trips across the channel himself to meet French officials alongside successive immigration ministers, thereaposs not a lot he can point to by way of breakthroughs. The Home Office say the Immigration Enforcement teamaposs investigations have led to  arrests and nine convictions this year . But his team and the Home Office been linked to a series of increasingly bonkers proposals for dealing with the crisis - which heaposs ended up having to walk back. Leaked emails in September  suggested the Home Office was exploring options for aposfloating wallsapos in the channel to block boats - something Mr OaposMahoney later admitted would not be useful. Mr OaposMahoney himself suggested using nets to clog up the propellers of dinghies crossing the Channel. Askedit was like a similar method using nets trialled by the Royal Navy, Mr OaposMahoney told the : Itaposs that type of thing, yes. So, safely disabling the engine and then taking the migrants on board our vessel. Asked about the plan last week he told a Committee of MPs he had been misquoted and that there would be no nets. And he admitted the idea of making a giant wave machine in the channel to push boats back was bizarre, and insisted no minister had ever discussed it with him. One co-venture with France he managed to get up and running - a small squadron of drones monitoring boats and smugglers across the channel - was grounded on the French side after it was found to be against French privacy laws. The French hope to have the legal wrangles resolved in the next few weeks. When he was appointed, Mr OaposMahoney set up a Twitter account, which promised updates on how we’re saving lives by making dangerous Channel crossings unviable.Since October , the account has tweeted just  times - less than six times a month. And all but a handful of the posts are retweets of other Government agencies. The last time Mr OaposMahoney posted to the account himself was in March.  Home Office Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft said: “Dan O’Mahoney plays a vital role leading the operational response to these dangerous and deadly crossings. “Dan has brought together teams across government to improve our response and break the business model of the callous criminal gangs who are facilitating these illegal crossings. The work he has led has, without doubt, has saved many hundreds of lives. “Dan has worked tirelessly with France and other international partners and as a result, we have stopped more than , attempted crossings so far this year, making  arrests and  convictions but there is absolutely more that can be done to step up this enforcement.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Home OfficeRoyal NavyNadine DorriesPriti PatelStanley JohnsonBoris JohnsonArmed forcesMental healthPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is “huge international concern” surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.With Moderna “rapidly advancing” a booster jab to combat Omicron, Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective and may hinder one of the UK’s Covid treatments, Ronapreve.  Ministers were facing calls to impose tougher restrictions to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case. Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a “very, very, very dficult situation”.Ministers were considering adding two more countries to the travel aposred listapos on Friday night, the Daily Mail reported.A government adviser suggested Brits should be ready for the possibility of ato Covid restrictions. However, a senior government source told the newspaper that people should not panic.  In the Netherlands, health officials said dozens of people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday are likely infected with Covid-. They were conducting further testing to seepeople are infected with the recently discovered Omicron iant. Dutch officials estimated that  of about  passengers had Covid. Omicron was first discovered in South Africa and has been designated a “iant of concern” by the World Health Organisation . Senior UK scientists had previously described it as the aposworst everapos Covid iant detected so far. The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the iant, which the organisation named Omicron, has an increased risk of reinfection and may sp rapidly than other strains. The EU, US and Canada all followed Britain’s move to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa ahead of the WHO adding the strain, also known as B..., to its highest category for concerning iants. Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an “increased risk of reinfection” and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a “growth advantage”. No cases have been detected in the UK but its arrival in Belgium – after being found in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel – has heightened concerns. Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the Rega Institute in Belgium, said a sample was confirmed as the iant in a traveller who ed from Egypt on November  before first showing symptoms  days later. The six African countries were added to the UK’s travel red list on Thursday evening and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel quarantine for  days. Downing Street urged anyone who has arrived from those countries recently to get tested. Mr Javid said discussions are ongoing over the prospect of adding further countries to the red list, telling the Commons the Government “won’t hesitate to actwe need to do so”. Mr Johnson held a call with South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday afternoon after foreign minister Naledi Pandor said the flight ban “seems to have been rushed”. The Prime Minister “commended South Africa’s rapid genomic sequencing” and its “leadership in transparently sharing scientic data”, Downing Street said. “They discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid- iant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel,” a statement said. Prof Edmunds said the new strain “is a huge worry” and that “all the data suggests” it would be able to evade current immunity.“Our fears are it would do so to a large extent,” he told BBC Radio ’s PM programme.Prof Edmunds urged ministers to look at extending travel restrictions and to prepare a plan to deal with Omicron because “at some point we’re going to get this iant here in the UK”.  He suggested mass testing and local restrictions must be looked at while other preparations could include making the booster programme more rapid, perhaps by reducing the gap between second and third doses, and widening it to younger age groups. “Even the vaccines don’t work particularly well against this new iant, they do against Delta, and we’re still fighting a Delta wave and we certainly don’t want to be fighting both at the same time,” he said. “There are things we can do and we need to get on with it very rapidly.” The Government said as of am on Friday, there had been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK, the highest reported daily figure since October . It also said a further  people had died within  days of testing positive for Covid- as of Friday, bringing the UK total to ,. South African scientists fear the iant is behind a dramatic rise in cases in some regions, including Gauteng province, which includes the cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg. Pfizer BioNTech, which has produced a vaccine against Covid-, is already studying the new iant’s ability to evade vaccines. Experts have said vaccines can be tweaked to tackle new iants as they emerge.

He says his own experience is the reason he knows the government’s current approach to the influx of migrants wishing to risk their lives crossing the channel simply will not work.He told the Sunday People : “The government’s focus is on how to deter people from coming in the first place. “Britain doesn’t have a al system where people can claim asylum before risking their lives to get here. It’s a policy of deterrence, not a policy of compassion. “They are trying to remove the pull factors – or send refugees back to France or the country they arrived in Britain from. “This is not the way to treat the most vulnerable people in society – people who are fleeing for their lives.  “What we need is open safe passage, and regular routes for people to claim asylum. But sending people back is not going to solve anything. “This is about addressing long term pull factors, smashing the criminal gangs that treat human beings as cargo and tackling supply chains. Priti should definitely step down. It’s a tough position, butyou are in charge of a big humanitarian issue and you lack compassion, then I don’t think she is the right person to take charge.” Hassan’s incredible journey is detailed in his book called Hope Not Fear.

The Prime Minister said he would be asking the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationto consider giving boosters to as wide a group as possible as well as reducing the gap between second and third doses. Presently, a period of at least six months is left between administering the second Covid jab and the booster. The third jab is also only currently offered to people over the age of , people over  with a health condition or frontline workers.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror.Professor Chris Whitty, Englandaposs chief medical officer, added that the JCVI will now need to decide whether to extend the booster vaccine down to adults age . He added that is inevitable the Omicron iant will spread across the world over the next few days. But he said while it is clear the new strain is highly transmissible, it is not yet clear how effective the vaccine will be as protection against it - but said those who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. Mr Johnson also announced on Saturday that mask rules will be mandatory in shops and on public transport, Omicron contacts will have to self-isolate and new arrivals will have to quarantine until they test negative for coronavirus.The press conference was hastily arranged after infections were identied in Nottingham and Brentwood in Essex. In an attempt to slow the spread, the Prime Minister announced temporary and precautionary measures to be reviewed in three weeks. The UK Health Security Agency confirmed the cases, which are both believed to be connected and linked to travel to southern Africa, after genomic sequencing overnight.  The iniduals and their households were ordered into self-isolation and targeted testing was being carried out in areas where they are thought to have been infectious Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will face travel restrictions from Sunday, when they will join South Africa and five other neighbouring nations on Englandaposs red list. Mr Johnson said: We need to take targeted and proportionate measures now as a precaution while we find out more. First we need to slow down the seeding of the iant in this country, we need to buy time for our scientists to understand exactly what weaposre dealing with, and for us to get more people vaccinated, and above all to get more people boosted. But the Prime Minister said border measures can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport, Mr Johnson said. While the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron is currently unclear, Mr Johnson said there are good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection.

The TV environmentalist sent a moving letter to sick William Verden, , who is in a right-to-le struggle between doctors and his parents.Chris urged William’s mum Amy to “be strong and fight long and hard.” She said the family were “totally blown away” by his backing.Medics think William should no longer have le-saving treatment as his kidneys are “devastated” and a transplant is unlikely to work. His parents oppose condemning him to end-of-le care and are ready to fight Manchester Children’s Hospital decision.  Autistic William is kept alive by gruelling daily dialysis sessions and now has toy tiger Richard. Amy, , said: “The tiger, his adopted brother, is also in end-stage renal failure. When William needs dressing changes, so does Richard.” Amy, of Newton, Lancs, thinks palliative care is not the only option, as William, who has focal ­segmental glomerulosclerosis, is well enough to play golf twice a week. She believes his ­autism is behind the decision, however Manchester University NHS Trust strongly denies this claim. Relatives are raising funds to buy William an iPad and treats.

And like you there are some things that I find really hard to deal with. I have to try really hard to make them acceptable, I think about them in advance and imagine all the things that might happen. I run through all the things that might happen over and over again.  Then when it actually comes to dealing with those things I find I am much better prepared, its almost like they have actually already happened, so it doesn’t matter as much when they do. Maybe you could try this with your medical treatments, get yourself prepared in advance. William, everyone is trying to help you. They really, really love you and want you to be well. When you are calm and everything is cool try to think about this and make plans to help them help you. And then try to stick to those plans – even when everything gets hectic. It’s very hard, but I really hope you can try. Imagine everything like that is a hole in one! Now that would be something.

Footage from one of the hotels which currently houses dozens of asylum seekers shows insects crawling in the base of the shower. Another video, taken at a dferent hotel its residents have asked the Mirror not to identy for fear of reprisals from the owners, captures maggots slithering across the floor. A third piece of footage shows mice running around a bedroom, while water can be seen gushing through the ceiling of a home where a family of asylum seekers were living. The ceiling of that home later collapsed. Photos from one hotel show two children, who spent a period of time in the Calais Jungle, covered in what appear to be bed bug bites. The images, which were all taken in West London, were shared with the Mirror to highlight the conditions many people who seek asylum in this country are living under as they wait, sometimes years, for their refugee status to be approved or rejected. Living on a small allowance of several pounds a day, and with no right to work until their applications are approved, often theyaposre unable to buy basic sanitary products to clean their rooms. The fear of being thrown out of the country by the Home Office means most people do not raise issues regarding their accommodation, an insider told the Mirror. This can lead to property health hazards and infestations going unreported and untreated. Access to hotels where theyaposre staying is highly restricted, meaning conditions inside remain largely a mystery. Volunteers have to meet residents in the car parks outside to deliver clothes donated by kind Brits. Less charitable people drive to the hotels to dump bags of rubbish in a kind of dirty protest against the asylum seekersapos efforts to make lives for themselves in the country. An immigration insider said: The people living in dispersed accommodation, they are put anywhere in the country and moved with a momentaposs notice. They canapost object. Very often they donapost get told until theyaposre in the transport where theyaposre going. It is called dispersal accommodation. If theyaposre in a hotel theyaposre on £ a week. Theyaposre frightened to speak out when there are issues, and frightened of not seeming grateful, so the issues will come to light after several months when they finally burst into tears when talking to a volunteer. In the case of the shower with the jumping termites, the lad never used it. He was too repulsed by it to wash. Many, many of the rooms have proper bed bug infestations. Itaposs a really big problem. If they didnapost feel in danger where they come from they wouldnapost live like this. They are not being looked after that helps them be a benefit to society. There is a lot of wasted talent among these families. The videos were shared with the Mirror at the end of a tragic week in which  people died trying to get to the UK. They lost their lives when their dinghy capsized while trying to cross the English Channel from France. Five women and a girl are reportedly among the victims confirmed dead so far in what has been described as the deadliest incident of its kind ever. People currently in Calais but hoping to get to the UK told The Mirror how they still planned on making the perilous journey, despite the freezing, rough waters in front of them. They said people smugglers’ prices of at least £, per head for a -metre boat with around  to  people squeezed in, meant the gang involved in the tragedy had taken at least £, in cash from those who died in the sea. Other estimates put the figure as high as £, per person. Jon, a -year-old former electrical engineering student from Eritrea, told how he and  other asylum seekers cheated death in the ocean on the same day  others perished.He set out on a small boat and paid £ for his share, only for the craft to sink into the icy water. Once, and , they make the crossing, many people are taking in by the authorities and processed. This is the beginning of a very y process which often sees people thrown out of the country. While they wait for their application to be heard, many are moved across the country to live away from those they travelled with, often alongside people without a language in common. Although the most recent yearaposs statistics have not yet been compiled, data from  shows that the UK receives far fewer first time asylum applications than other European countries its size.In  , applications were made, compared to three times that in Germany, and more than double that in France and Spain. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We expect high standards from our accommodation providers, and where we are alerted to substandard accommodation we will act.However, the Mirror have refused to provide us with the name of this accommodation which would allow us to look into these claims. “We use licenced hotels which are permitted for use by the local authority. If any asylum seeker has a problem with their accommodation they can contact Migrant Help, which is available  days a year and  hours a day. “The Nationality and Borders Bill will deliver the most comprehensive reform in decades to fix the broken asylum system.It will make the system fairer and more effective so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Home OfficeAsylum Seekers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson addressed the nation on Saturday evening, just hours after the first cases of the iant in the UK were confirmed.Travellers coming to the UK will have to take a day two PCR test and anyone who is traced to have been in contact with someone who tests positive will have to isolate for  days. Daily Covid cases in the UK have risen by . per cent in just a week as just under , new positive results were recorded today. The UK has seen a total of , cases over the last seven days, with yesterdayrecording , infections and  fatalities. By simply entering your postcode in our interactive tool below, you can check the number of confirmed cases in your area Following the PMaposs announcement at pm, masks will again be mandatory in shops and public transport, and the Government has urged everyone to do their bit by getting their booster jab. The first case of the Omicron iant was reported to the World Health Organisation from South Africa earlier this month, but in the last week cases were confirmed in Italy, Germany and Czech Republic. Earlier today the UK Government confirmed two cases in Chelmsford, Essex and Nottingham.  The Prime Minister said: This is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new iant and maximises our defences. A tweet from the PMaposs office said: COVID UPDATE: All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status.They will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace.Earlier today officials confirmed the first to Omicron cases in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham, forcing the PM to act. In a press conference from Downing Street, he also announced that all arrivals to the UK will face mandatory PCR tests. The Prime Minister added border measures can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport, Mr Johnson said.

Nichola Petermann was just  when she learned she had Hodgkin lymphoma and needed immediate treatment - forcing her to leave her dream job months after she started.Medics believed her symptoms, which included fevers, abdominal pain and night sweats, were a result of her contracting coronavirus in January.But as her illness got progressively worse she found herself taking painkillers six times a day in order to continue her day-to-day le. In the absence of answers Nichola, from Glasgow, repeatedly sought medical attention, but the likelihood of it being long Covid masked the advanced stage her cancer had reached. It was only after a visit to her grandmaaposs home that Nichola realised just how ill she actually was - because she needed more sleep and ate even less than her elderly relative. Charity bosses say they fear Nicholaaposs cancer experience could be replicated across the UK, as signs of cancer can be very similar to the long-term effects of coronavirus. When she was finally diagnosed with stage b cancer, her condition was so advanced that she was advised to start chemotherapy the following day - forcing her to leave her dream job working in TV which sheaposd started in December. Nichola told The Mirror: I did think it was long Covid for a long time, I had no idea how serious it was. Because I was working and it was harder to see GPs, it was really hard. I treated it myself with pain relief, but eventually it got to the point where I couldnapost handle it anymore. I was taking paracetamol six times a day, I donapost think they believed me when I said how much pain I was in. It was only when she visited her grandmother, who is herself battling stomach cancer, that she realised how ill she was. I noticed that I was sleeping more and eating less than she was, she said. That’s when I knew for certain that something was wrong. When the pain in Nicholaaposs abdomen and lower back became too much to bear, she contacted NHS , which referred her to an Immediate Assessment Unit because staff were worried about the amount of paracetamol she was taking.However, when ultrasounds and X-rays did not reveal a gynaecological problem Nichola was on the verge of being discharged before a final set of tests finally revealed how ill she was. I was told I was possibly going home, even though I was clearly in a lot of pain, she said. I was scared about having to leave. It was only after an ultrasound revealed oian cysts and trapped fluid that medics were finally able to give her a le-saving cancer diagnosis. By that stage her lymph nodes were swollen - another symptom she put down to long Covid - and doctors had to break the news that Nichola had Hodgkin lymphoma. I hadnapost heard of it, I didnapost know what it meant, she said. Itaposs a very aggressive cancer, but that does mean it can be easier to treat. As soon as it was diagnosed they realised how serious it was, I started chemotherapy the next day. Such was the urgency to start chemotherapy that Nichola was advised there was not time to undergo fertility preservation. She spent  weeks in hospital, with the treatment leaving her unable to walk and having to be fed through a tube due to muscositis. Nichola lost three stone during her time at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, and had to be helped by nurses to move around. She praised the dedicated medics who supported her during her treatment. Although they were also clearly short staffed, I never felt like it impacted my care at all, she said. Nichola was finally discharged in August, and a month later she was given the welcome news that her cancer is in remission. Still suffering from chronic fatigue and struggling to walk long distances, Nichole is hoping to be able toto work in the New Year. Iaposm much better but Iaposm still being quite slow, Iaposm still struggling a lot with a lot of pain. Iaposm getting there, I still have a lot of fatigue, but Iaposm really eager to get back to work, I will hopefully start looking for something after Christmas. In the meantime Nichola is determined to do something to support Blood Cancer UK, a charity who she said has been a huge help during her illness.Over the course of November she has been walking every day in a . mile challenge, and her fundraising page has already raised more than £,.Kate Keightley, head of support and service development, said: “During the peak of the pandemic, we saw far fewer people being diagnosed with blood cancer, and one of the reasons for this could be that some of the symptoms of blood cancer are easily mistaken for Covid. Symptoms such as fatigue, fever and night sweats can sometimes be dismissed or downplayed and the result can be devastating. “More than half of British adults cannot name any symptom of blood cancer despite it being the third biggest cancer killer in the UK. If you have symptoms that cannot be explained and are persistent, you should urgently make an appointment with your GP. While it is unlikely to be anything serious, it’s so important to get checked out.”To sponsor Nichola and support Blood Cancer UK, click here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsCancerHodgkins lymphoma\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Little Eris unexpectedly entered the world at  weeks and five days, weighing the same as a small can of soup at lb oz. She was placed straight into a plastic bag to keep her vital organs warm - preventing the risk of hypothermia - whilst mum Cayce Lee, , was under general anaesthetic following the emergency c-section. Cayce,  and her husband Dennis, , prepared to say goodbye on more than one occasion during the  days in the neonatal intensive care unit . Cayce, from Lewisville, North Carolina US, said: “I was always quite nervous when I was pregnant with Eris as I had a stillbirth before. “The doctors stitched my cervix shut to prevent an early breach, and I was having progesterone injections from about  weeks.  “At  weeks, the doctor’s found that I was already dilated by two centimetres. “I managed to last another three weeks, which helped us to get Eris over the threshold where medical staff could intervene to save her le. After going into labour, Cayce was put under anaesthetic as a surgical team performed an emergency c-section, placing Eris into a sandwich bag before racing to place her in the NICU on a ventilator.After her birth, Eris developed a series of health problems, including a staph infection caused by bacteria, pneumonia, and sepsis.At one point, Eris was also put on a le support machineafter being coming extremely ill, and unable to breathe alone.

She added: “Her lungs were the main problem, as she really struggled to breathe alone. “She was pretty much on all the maxed-out settings on the ventilator. Cayce first got to hold Eris at one and a half weeks, whilst husband Dennis was only able to hold her after seven weeks due to Erisapos fragile state, alongside Covid- restrictions.

Carla Bellucci was hammered online after admitting she faked depression to get a £, nose job on the NHS.The OnlyFans mum says her kids Jermaine, , Tanisha,  and Jayden,  are still having to suffer at the hands of trolls after her confession in . Now the social media star, who welcomed her fourth child Blue Gianna last month, says she needs to make sure they have a great Christmas after a dficult few years. Carla, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, says the family were forced to leave their home in Borehamwood after her TV interview. The -year-old says she owes it to them to make it one to remember - and has a big budget to play with thanks to her online earnings.Speaking to Fabulous, she said: “I am looking at a budget of at least £, - there were times when I really struggled even to feed my kids so I really want to make this year special now that I can.  “My kids have been through so much over the years what with the trolling I get twinned with me being in the papers, they often get picked on because of me. “Obviously spending money on them doesn’t make up for that but I do want to give them the Christmas they really deserve.” Earlier this year she claimed other mothers on the school run have called her a aposs**gapos behind her back.The former Page  model claims to have made more than £, by sharing pregnancy pictures on her OnlyFans account.She says some of the mums at her childrenaposs school have actually signed up to her page as they are aposdesperateapos to see her content.Carla told the Daily Star : The school run is horric – mums stand and gossip non stop.  Parents evenings are a nightmare as I can feel them talking about me as I walk past. They even make up petitions about me online to try and stop me being on OnlyFans. I have heard that they have also held meetings about me – it’s all crazy beyond me! Carla added: The mums will even get together for wine nights and gossip I have been told they have held coffee mornings to talk nonsense about me. And not only that, some follow Carla on the adult subscription site purely to spy on what she’s getting up to. She said: I have proof that mums are the ones who troll – they do it off their own accounts it never shocks me how dumb they can be. Mums have admitted to subscribing because they are so desperate to see what I’m up to.

Daughter Princess Anne and the Queen’s racing manager John Warren are the two people she will speak to and both of these callers can get through to her majesty from anywhere in the world. Royal commentator Jonathan Sacerdoti made the claim about the Queen’s dialling habits, adding that she uses a Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI. Mr Sacerdoti told US presenter Christina Garibaldi: “Apparently the Queen has two people who she speaks to the most on her phones and she also apparently has a mobile phone which is said to be Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI so nobody can hack into her phone. “But the two people she phones the most are said to be her daughter Princess Anne and her racing manager John Warren.” And particularlyJohn calls, “she answers”. “He is the son-in-law of the Queen’s friend, the late Earl of Carnarvon and his home was Highclere castle in Berkshire which viewers of TV may know better as Downton Abbey.”John is one of the world’s leading horsemen and oversees all of the Queen’s racing and breeding interests. Her royal majesty has been involved with horses for over  years and first attended the Royal Ascot in  aged  years old, according to Britain Magazine. And it seems the Queen has an unbreakable bond with her only daughter Anne despite having multiple other children to favour. Their relationship has been captured over the years in photographs, that show the pair coordinate fashion styles and colour schemes. And with a nod to this, the Queen published a series of heartwarming photos to mark Anneaposs st birthday on Sunday  August. Perhaps the pair bonded over horse riding and all things equestrian as it has been a le-time hobby for both. The monarch has been praised for her work-ethic and Anne has followed in her footsteps too by attending royal engagements yearly, reports Hello Magazine.

As a working mum of two, I really feel for her. Early years are hard, juggling work, childcare and le with not much sympathy or empathy. But there are two threads to her story. First, a mother’s right to take their baby into their working environment – in Ms Creasy’s case cocooned to her chest in a sling while a debate was going on. Unfortunately that right had been taken away by a parliamentary rule banning infants from the chamber – now to be reviewed. For me, taking my babies to work at three months old would have been the last thing on my mind – in smart clothes, breastfeeding and all the bits and bobs such as wipes, bibs, nappies etc. I like to keep work and my personal le separate – for my own sanity and the baby’s too.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I breastfed for eight months, in shopping centres, parks and cafés. But I’d never have done it in front of colleagues in a meeting. Not because of embarrassment, but out of consideration for those without kids and who may feel uncomfortable seeing my breast out and a baby suckling while discussing a profit statement. Also, the Commons is no place for a baby’s natural development. Mine during this early stage were keen to learn through touching, hearing, smelling and looking – they’d make gurgling sounds, let out screams of excitement and yelps of joy – this is what they should be encouraged to do. SoI were in a meeting with my child strapped to my bosom, I would be distracted and feel guilty for not giving both my child and colleagues my full attention. Also, is Ms Creasy trying to set a precedent for all women to have the right to take their baby into their work environment  So will a TV presenter have the right to read the news while breastfeeding  Can a police officer have her baby with her on patrol  Can a teacher take hers into the classroom  Where do we draw the line  On a parenting course, a key message for me was that it’s important to put the needs of the child before your own. The second thread to Ms Creasy’s story is the need to make holding down a job easier for mums – so more creches at work, help with childcare and more nursery places.  As an MP, Ms Creasy already has it all – maternity leave on full pay, use of the family room in Westminster, an on site nursery, £, for a locum to cover constituency work for six months, and a baby leave proxy vote while away. Being allowed to vote remotely in those early years, between  and , instead of trudging into Westminster for late-night isions would be good sense. I think these are the points Ms Creasy should be making. Waving your flag for having babies in the Commons just makes a mockery of more fundamental challenges for working mums everywhere.

A headteacher was killed in Antrim, Northern Ireland when a tree fell on top of his car, more than  lorries were stuck in heavy snow in Greater Manchester, and more than , homes were without power overnight. And it was confirmed a second man had died after a tree fell on him at pm on Friday in Ambleside, Cumbria.The Met Office said speeds hit mph at Brizlee Wood in Northumberland. While the red weather warning expired in the early hours of Saturday, the forecaster said amber and yellow warnings for wind remained in place, with the expectation of “some very strong gusts” in many areas.Do you have pictures of damage caused by the storm or snow  Contact us at webnews@mirror  People were still advised to only travelabsolutely necessary as the storm continued to pose a danger to le, and the Met Office described gusts overnight as “damaging” and having affected “a wide swathe of the United Kingdom”. As much as cm of snow was expected over the Pennines and cm on higher ground in the Midlands, with flakes settling at lower levels across the UK. Primary school headteacher Francis Lagan was named locally as the man who died when a tree fell on a car in County Antrim on Friday.Wind speeds reached mph in Orlock Head, County Down.

Photos on social media showed signicant damage caused by the high winds in the north east town of Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire. One picture showed an entire garage roof that had blown off and hit the side of a nearby house. Roads were closed by fallen debris in the worst-hit parts of Scotland, while LNER train services north of Newcastle were also ground to a halt, with high winds, heavy rain and snowfall arriving from Friday afternoon.

Meanwhile ScotRail services were disrupted between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street, Dunblane and Stirling after a barn was blown onto the line close to Polmont, near Falkirk.

He stated his brother Thomas Hughes, who is jointly accused of murder, went aposwithin himselfapos when he started a relationship with Tustin and started to lose ties with his family.Tustin, , and Hughes, , have denied murder and multiple counts of child cruelty. It is alleged they apossystematicallyapos abused Arthur during the first coronavirus lockdown before he collapsed of fatal head injuries at their home in Cranmore Road, Shirley on June  last year.He died the following morning in hospital after doctors concluded he could not be saved and switched his le support off.The trial at Coventry Crown Court resumed yesterday after a number of issues ground proceedings to a halt for more than three days this week.On Monday, the jury was told that Tustin had been taken to hospital due to concerns over her health. This afternoon Judge Wall stated she had been assessed and deemed fit to continue. He also confirmed one juror has now been discharged on health grounds and reiterated a previous direction to the remainder of the  to ignore media coverage of the case. As the only witness to give evidence yesterday, Andrew Hughes described his first impression of Tustin as aposvery, very coldapos. He stated his brotheraposs relationship with her moved aposvery quicklyapos and that Thomas Hughes soon became aposstricterapos on Arthur by punishing him for minor things that aposwerenapost an issue beforeapos. Mr Hughes added his brother found it aposincreasingly hardapos to spend time with Arthur because Tustin would aposmake an effort to interveneapos.  He told the court the last time he saw Arthur was around a week before the first lockdown in March  and said: He seemed far more timid. He seemed more aware he may get in trouble. There was this voice Arthur would sometimes make, referred to as his baby voice. Before it was never an issue but it became an issue not long after Ms Tustin came on the scene. Mr Hughes stated his brother was aposvery warmapos with a aposstrong belief in familyapos prior to meeting Tustin. Describing his impression of his brother afterwards he added: He went within himself. With his immediate family, mom, dad, brothers, the ties seemed to become weaker and weaker. He didnapost seem to be invested in keeping that strong. In cross-examination Mr Hughes was askedthought everything that happened to Arthur was Tustinaposs fault, to which he replied: I believe sheaposs the catalyst for it. He denied he had intentionally walked in front of her in just his shorts to aposshow offapos, although acknowledged his brother told him off for doing so.  He stated he found nothing attractive about Tustin and said: She was domineering. If she didnapost get what she wanted she would make things dficult for everyone . Reiterating his view of her Mr Hughes added: A cold, manipulating, calculating person who made every attempt to stay away from the family and draw my brother from the family as well. It has previously been alleged Tustin and Thomas Hughes made Arthur spend up to  hours a day isolated in their hallway, assaulted him, deprived him of food and water as well as poisoned him with salt. The prosecution has argued Hughes encouraged violence towards his son but that Tustin carried out the fatal attack while she was alone with him at the Cranmore Road address. The trial began in early October and today Judge Wall told the jury they could be sent out to reach verdicts as early as next Wednesday.

Colleen Smith had only recently moved in with Samantha Hart and Charlie Olding, who she considered to be friends, when the couple dragged her into their cellar where they filmed themselves raping her. Some of the stomach-churning attack was filmed by Oldingaposs cousin Lee Kitchiner, who was  at the time. The couple have since been jailed and Colleen, , has bravely decided to waive her anonymity to encourage other victims to seek help.Speaking to the Daily Star, she said she has been “scarred for le” and has nightmares in which she wakes up screaming.“What they did was make me feel not wanted, ashamed and lonely,” she said. “I sometimes get voices in my head telling me I’m worthless. I was a happy and lively person but now I’m down and depressed.“I am just a broken person now.” Colleen, from Medway, Kent, moved in with the couple in October  and found the pair “constantly argued” creating a tense atmosphere in the house. Three weeks after moving, on September , Colleen headed out with a friend to the pub, where they enjoyed some drinks. But at some point during the night, Olding and Hart began to call her. Colleen recalled: “I even said to my friend it was weird because they never ring me that much. My mate told me not to go back and she had an instinct that something was going to happen. I told her not to be silly and that nothing will happen. “I thought they were my friends.” Colleen’s pal gave her a lt to the home in Chatham, Kent, and the vile abuse started shortly after. Hart, Olding and Kitchiner were waiting for her in the alleyway beside the property, where they “smacked” Colleen in the face before throwing her phone onto train tracks. She was then dragged into the home and ordered to go down to the cellar. Colleen said: “I have never been a fighter and I don’t like arguments so I was more shocked than anything. I was totally shocked like ‘why would you do this ’ and it was just very confusing. “I hoped it was a dream and I was going to wake up any minute, but obviously it wasn’t a dream.” Colleen said she was eventually forced to perform a sex act on Olding, while being filmed. Next, Olding proceeded to rape her as the others watched.  She said: “I was trying my hardest to tell them to stop but they wouldn’t stop. “I could see they were filming and I was thinking in my head are they going to send this to my friends  Are they going to send this to people so they can laugh at me and that’s what I was worried about. I didn’t knowI was going to live or not.” The brutality lasted six hours before the trio eventually went upstairs to go to bed. At this point, around .am, a badly hurt Colleen decided to try and flee, legging it to a friend’s house. “I thought apos I don’t run I will die - If I don’t run Iaposm gone and my family won’t even knowapos,” she said. Colleen reached her friend’s home and the police arrived  minutes later. She was taken to hospital with a suspected broken eye socket and the despicable trio were arrested. Colleen was eventually diagnosed with PTSD before she bravely gave evidence via video link during the trial at Maidstone Crown Court earlier this year. The court was shown more than  video clips from Olding’s phone of the brutal assault. Hart and Olding,  and , from Chatam, Kent, were convicted of rape and causing a person to engage in sexual activity - receiving  and  years respectively.  Meanwhile Kitchiner, now , from Strood, Kent, was found guilty of the sexual activity offence and was cleared of rape and assault. He was handed a two-year custodial sentence suspended for two years, along with  hours of unpaid work,  rehabilitation sessions, and a -month curfew. Judge Philip Statman said: “Each of you made callous, disgusting remarks about how this act should be performed. “It caused your victim to be violated and she felt embarrassed and disgusted by what she was being told to do. This was a grave attack of a sexual nature perpetrated on your victim.” Colleen added: “I wanted to go to the sentencing to look them in the eye to show them what they have done to me but I couldn’t. But I thought it was an amazing sentence because I feared they would be let free. “I hope they get what they deserve in prison for what they did to me.” Colleen is now taking things one day at a time and dreams of one day being her old self, able to live her le the way she wants, independently, without looking over her shoulder. “Thankfully my mum and my siblings have got me through this. If it wasn’t for them I don’t think I would be here,” she said. “I’m not going to say I’m doing really well but I’m getting there. I am starting to be me again, well trying to. It has been so hard.” Colleen wants to now speak out to encourage other survivors who may be dealing with trauma alone to get support. She said: “Don’t be scared to speak about what you have been through. Please tell someone, I’ve learned thatyou tell someone you can get the support you need. “It’s so important not to bottle it up like I did.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsCourt caseCrown courtCrimeRape\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The World Health Organisation warned evidence suggests the iant, labelled Omicron in its Greek alphabet naming convention, has an increased risk of re-infection and may sp rapidly. The iant should have been called Nu but the WHO believes that would be confused with the word “new”, so used the next letter – omicron. From midday today, the UK halted flights from six countries: South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Swaziland. Health Secretary Sajid Javid, in an urgent statement in the Commons, told the public: “If you’ve arrived from any of these countries in the last  days, NHS Test and Trace will be asking you to take a PCR test.“But please don’t wait to be contacted. You should take PCR tests right away.” He added: “It is highly likely it has spread to other ­countries. We are concerned this iant may pose substantial risk to public health.” Almost , people have arrived from South Africa in the past two weeks. Around  cases of Omicron had been found by genetic sequencing in South Africa, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel. The European ­Commission has ­recommended an EU-wide travel ban to and from southern Africa.  Experts fear history could repeat itself a year after the Alpha iant triggered a Christmas lockdown. Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, warned: “We all need to be ready for the possibility of a change in the restrictions.” Mr Javid said the Government is still following its Plan A but warned, “ we need to go further, we will”. Prof Sharon Peacock, director of the Covid- Genomics UK ­Consortium, said we may only be able to “buy time” before the Omicron iant gets in to Britain.  She said: “Once a new iant of concern emerges, and it’s fitter than the previous iant, it can be ­dficult to stop it going into a country unless you have very, very ­stringent lockdown rules.” Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “It is the most worrying we have seen.” Askedit could already be in Britain, she said: “It’s always possible.”  Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, said: “This is a huge worry. The molecular data would point to perhaps this thing being able to evade the immune response.” And England’s Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty told the Local Government Association his greatest fear is people would not adhere to another lockdown after “two years of their lives being interfered with”.  Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said any spread “could coincide with what we’re expecting to be an extremely ­dficult winter”. Carol Popplestone, council chair of the Royal College of Nursing, called for swt action. She urged: “The Government must reintroduce compulsory face coverings immediately and set out further steps in the coming days.” Welsh rugby teams Cardf and Scarlets were trying tofrom South Africa, and  UK and Ireland golfers have quit the Johannesburg Open. Tourists from the UK landing in Cape Town wept when they were told South Africa was “red listed”. Anna DeMarigny, , of Galway, Ireland, had flown in to see her terminally ill friend.  She said: “My daughter is due to visit me from San Francisco with her baby. I can’t go into quarantine. I’m going to have to cut short my stay.” Tony Haupt, , of Oxford, had arrived to visit five of his six ­children. He said: “I hope I get back in time for my daughter’s graduation.” Mr Javid said the ban on flights is temporary while the UK re-established its Red List hotel ­quarantine scheme. But Dr Angelique Coet­­zee, of the South African Medical ­Association, said the travel restrictions are “like a storm in a teacup.” Downing Street said Boris Johnson had spoken to South Africa’s ­president Cyril Ramaphosa, saying: “The PM commended South Africa’s leadership in transparently sharing data.”AstraZeneca said it is hopeful that its antibody cocktail will retain ­efficacy against the omicron iant. England’s weekly R number has risen above one to between . and ., estimates suggest. In the latest -hour period, , infections were recorded, the highest daily count for over a month.

The Thursday evening announcement meant that South Africa was added to the list from Friday at pm, so all flights were suspended and those arriving in the UK were forced to isolate for  days. From am on Sunday, this quarantine period will need to take place in a hotel. Countless Brits, including Jessica and Michael Dickinson were caught in the sudden announcement, and now find themselves stranded in South Africa, currently with no way home. Jessica, , described the situation as a “worst nightmare come true”. They had had their daughter Amelia-Rose, -months-old, during the pandemic, and none of their relatives from South Africa had seen her yet, so once restrictions lted, the pair booked a trip out to introduce her to her family. “Many people haven’t been home for quite some time, but we had our daughter and wanted her to meet the rest of her family. “When the borders opened we thought it was a great opportunity to come and see our family, we’d had a couple deaths in the family, so we thought it was important to make the trip out. “We moved to the UK and have been here for  years, we recently had our daughter and have had no family support raising her. Nobody’s met her, this was an opportunity for them to at least meet her, because people are getting old and you never know when it will be somebody’s last time.” After flying out last week, the family from Surrey were due totonight. The first they knew about the announcement was when Amelia woke Jessica up crying, and she checked her phone to see messages from a friend about it. However, as they were due toon Friday they thought they would be okay to fly home as usual. Then they got an email from British Airways saying their flight was cancelled. “It’s literally just a snowball effect of everything, getting home, my daughter being sick, jobs,” Jessica said. “My daughter’s also not been very well, she’s had a bad chest infection and I’ve been keen to get her back to the UK to have her looked at so this has really thrown us off. “In the morning , we went down for breakfast and we overheard some other Brits talking about how they were all trying to rush off.

Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. “There were people rushing to get PCR tests and take flights that had like three stayovers. But we can’t do that, we have our daughter.” Jessica described how they had sat on the phone for hours trying to get through to ious airlines to no avail, and even how the British consulate was “useless”. “Both me and my husband are due to start back at work on Monday, but I don’t have my work laptop and we have to figure out childcare this side, whilst still paying for our nursery that side. “It’s been relentless.  “We nearly finalised another flight with Emirates on Tuesday evening, and were ready to pay until it was cancelled. “We understand we’ll have to do the hotel quarantine but we’re worried about doing it with our daughter and I’m ADHD. I’m worried about what it’s going to be like on the other side. I get that’s what it needs to be like to get back home. On the journey back they face a bill of thousands because of the government’s actions as they have to book new flights and then pay for hotel quarantine too. British Airways, like all airways operating to and from South Africa from the UK, learned about the governmentaposs ban the same time as everyone . Given no prior-warning, they were left scrambling to try and organise a way home for the Brits stuck abroad whilst having very little to no guidance from the government. They have set up a dedicated phone line for Brits in South Africa and now Jessica, Michael and Amelia have a flight booked in for the th to get them home.

Sheaposd spent two weeks decorating the basement and picking up ingredients before cooking a delicious Thanksgiving dinner for all her friends.Sadly her aposfriendsapos stood her up and according to Christian, they didn’t even bother to let her know that they wouldn’t be attending.In a video on TikTok, Christian explained: My girlfriend was so excited for her first Friendsgiving but no one showed up. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here She decorated the whole basement and cooked so much food. I keep trying to cheer her up but nothing is working. He showed off the lavishly decorated space and tables laden with food - as well as the empty seats beside his partner, who looks close to tears. He added: I’m so sad for her. In the comment section, people flocked to share their outrage at her so-called friends, with one viewer writing: This is the problem nowadays. No integrity, no honour, no appreciating or value in our connections. Glad she had a happy ending. In a follow-up video, Christian said that after Maryannaposs pals failed to show up, he took matters into his own hands. My girl and her friends decided to throw a Friendsgiving like two weeks in advance, they were planning this for two weeks, he explained. They were planning everything, everything was all set – the date, the time, and everything. They were all gonna come. But the day came and no one was answering the group chat. No one was texting or calling, but in her mind, she thought everyone was running late. When it hit the three-hour mark, she was like: aposYeah no one’s gonna come.apos She called me and told me what happened so I started heading over to her house. On the way there, I called my friends. I told my friends, “Hey, are you [open to] coming to my girls Thanksgiving ”‘ he added. They were more than gracious enough to come. They all came and brought stuff. It’s like she had her own Friendsgiving, there was a happy ending to it. She wasn’t upset, she wasn’t mad, she was kind of disappointed about her actual friends not showing up but other than that, she still had great company and she still had a great time.

A minister said it had probably arrived in Germany after mutations were found in a passenger arriving from South Africa. Kai Klose, a social affairs minister in Hesse which is home to Frankfurt airport tweeted: Last night several Omicron-typical mutations were found in a traveller ing from South Africa. The airport is one of the biggest transport hubs and one of Europeaposs busiest airports. Full sequencing of the iant is being carried out and the infected person is isolating. The minister urged anyone who had travelled from South Africa in the last few weeks to limit contacts and get tested. Omicron has been found while Germany and many other European countries are grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases with some enforcing restrictions.Germany recorded , new coronavirus cases on Saturday and more than , people have died with Covid-. It has declared South Africa a virus-iant area which means airlines are allowed to fly only Germans to the country from South Africa.  Even vaccinated people must spend  days in quarantine in the country. This comes as Dutch health officials said earlier they had detected  Covid cases among people who flew from South Africa on Friday. Experts are trying to establish whether any of those who caught the virus were infected with the new Omicron iant which has emerged as fresh strain.  Those who tested positive for then new strain have been put in isolation at a hotel near Schiphol airport. The passengers were among  travellers who were held for several hours after arrival while they were tested.

Smugglers had been demanding €,per person for the treacherous journey in flimsy dinghies.It is feared the price cut will encourage yet more to attempt the -mile trip, made even more dangerous by deteriorating weather.Victims of last week’s disaster who remain unidentied are likely to be buried in basic graves labelled ‘Monsieur or Madame X’, sources say. But the grim ending for so many has not deterred others continuing their desperate efforts to reach the UK.  “We know about the people who died but we have no choice,” said Iraqi-Kurd Hassan Ahmed at the sprawling Grand-Synthe camp near Dunkirk. “I was told the price has come down because of people dying, €,.” The -year-old added: “It is still expensive – but I will try and get on a boat one day, one week.” Hassan, who says he spent €, just to reach the French coast, said migrants making the crossing receive a message before they embark telling them where their dinghy has been hidden in miles of sand dunes.  A second message gives the location of an outboard motor and a pump with which to inflate the boat. He said the migrants deal with the traffickers via an Eastern European go-between known only as Akim. Hassan is among  living in squalid conditions near old rail tracks, and the hopeful keep on coming. Nine members of the Al-Kahzraji family – including children aged four,  and  – pitched tents yesterday. Mum Shadan said the family fled fighting in Iraqi Kurdistan. After spending several years in Germany she claims the authorities there refused them papers to remain. Older son Danyal, , said they had been told it will cost €, to get them all to the UK.  As his little brother and sister Havel and Nur played on the litter-strewn tracks, he said: “We want a le in Great Britain. We want to live there and work there.” He said they knew many people had died making the crossing this week. But it was a risk worth taking as they could notto Kurdistan. At least  men, seven women – including one who was pregnant – and three children are confirmed dead. But detectives from France’s Organised Crime squad believe empty le jackets suggest more drowned. Bodies that cannot be identied are likely to join dozens buried in anonymous graves in Calais. We saw three such graves at Cimetière Sud, in an area a groundsman said is “for migrants, the poor and destitute”. Each cement slab had a sign saying “Monsieur X” and the year of death. At another cemetery – Cimetière Nord – a groundsman pointed out more plots. Many are little more than mounds of mud and a cross. Some  plots are marked out for more burials. Campaigners despair over the “undignied” end and the fact it means victims’ families may never even receive confirmation of their death. Nathanaël Caillaux, of Catholic charity Secours Catholique Calais Accueil Social, said: “It’s more than a few. It is very sad.” Non-profit organisation Groupe Décès has called on French authorities to identy and find family members to arrange repatriation. The group usually tries this itself, but Mr Caillaux said “ people is impossible and this should be the work of the state”.  Police have interviewed the only two survivors of Wednesday’s tragedy after they were released from hospital. The men – an Iraqi Kurd identied as Mohammed Khalid and a Somalian named as Omar, who are in their s – told of “mass panic” as the boat deflated and sank into the sea. An investigating source said authorities fear there may be more dead as empty lejackets were found in the sea. “People smugglers don’t provide extra lejackets, so the assumption is there will still be bodies,” he said. Soaking bank notes found in some of victims’ clothes helped confirm the dead include a Kurdish woman and man from Syria, two Yemeni men, an Iranian Kurd and two Iraqis. Kurd Maryam Nuri Hamdamin, , who messaged her fiancé in the UK after the boat got into trouble, was the first victim officially named. And Mohammad Aziz, , is feared drowned after he phoned a pal to say: “The engine isn’t powerful enough – I don’t knowwe’re going to make it.”  Fears are also growing for four Afghan youngsters. Riaz Mohammed, , Share Mohammed, , and two other teens, Palowan, , and Shinai, , were among those trying to cross. One charity worker said it was hard to know who had died and who had “made it” from any crossing as UK authorities confiscate the mobile phones of anybody they find. But more are waiting to make the journey under the ruthless smugglers, because le is so miserable here and in the places they came from. Mohammed Hutamzadth, , who has made four failed bids to reach the UK, lives in sheltered accommodation after travelling from Iran five years ago. He keeps a gun for protection. He said: “Living is very dangerous, there is a sort of mafia who control everything. In Calais, money is God. “As long as I have money I will easily find someone who will take me in a boat. Of course it is dangerous. But my whole le has become dangerous.” To underline his point, evidence of crossings littered the beach at Wimereux, near Boulogne, yesterday. A water scoop cut out of a petrol can and bits of what looked like jacket straps were among the detritus. Charity volunteer Phoebe Westwood, , from Bristol says the only way to end the chaos – and deaths – is to provide a “safe or legal route” and process applications properly. “The week before the shipwreck  people were rescued from the sea,” she said. “It’s tragedy after tragedy.” aposNo must end blame game and solve crisisapos - Comment, by Nick Thomas-Symonds, Shadow Home Secretary I am furious with the vile people-smuggling gangs putting lives in deadly danger to make money. This has to stop. It should not take the tragic deaths of  people, including children and a pregnant mother, to kick-start action. For years the Conservatives vowed to solve this. But on their watch the number of people crossing has soared from  in  to more than , this year. And even now they are trying to blame others for their failings. The PM humiliated the country by mishandling his letter to the French President calling for international action, which ended with the Home Secretary banned from talks with European partners. Talk about an own goal.  But the international blame game won’t help anyone. The French and British Governments must show leadership, sit down together and urgently fix this humanitarian crisis. Simply trying to stop smugglers launching boats off French beaches isn’t working. We need cross-country working and better efforts between law enforcers in Britain and Europe. This must come with deals for safe s, which the Government has failed to negotiate since the UK left the regulation enabling some asylum seekers’to EU countries. There are also desperate people who need our help and should be able to travel safely and legally to the UK. The Government promised to help , unaccompanied children but ended the scheme after aiding just . It should be reopened urgently. Failure to provide safe, legal routes results in more people risking their lives on small boats. The Government must get a grip of this deadly mess, or further tragedy is inevitable.

But there are still plenty of countries where Brits can travel which do not have restrictions or are not on the updated red list. Covid cases are on the increase and speculation has emerged about a new iant which has been found several countries. But fully-vaccinated travellers from the UK are still being welcomed with open arms at a host of European destinations And many of the countries traditionally visited by Brits at this time of year will be more than grateful to see fully-vaccinated visitors. Austriais perhaps the most restricted, with a full lockdown being imposed until December .Proof of full vaccination, or a negative PCR test will be required after restrictions come to an end but for the moment curbs remain in place.In theNetherlandsa ‘semi-lockdown’ is in place with restrictions remaining until December .Visitors must be fully-vaccinated or have proof of a negative test  hours before travelling.Although many Christmas markets inGermanyhave been cancelled, the fully-vaccinated can still visit after completing a pre-departure form. The government, however, have warned a full lockdown cannot be ruled out.InFranceFrom December , over-s must have had a booster jab for indoor venues. Any one hoping to head to the slopes will have to be fully-vaccinated or have proof of a negative test taken to access lts.But French president Emmanuel Macron says Lockdowns are currently not necessaryDemonstrations over Covid passes have fallen inCroatiaand gaining entry is not an issueyou are fully jabbed or can prove a recent negative test. Tourism bosses in Croatia say tourists can freely enter the republic.InBelgiumprotests have taken place but entry rules are now being eased for visitors.Rules have been relaxed for vaccinated arrivals and a negative PCR Covid test less than  hours old is required to gain entry.The borders ofSwitzerlandare welcoming double-jabbed BritsNHS Covid passes are accepted in place of Swiss Covid Certicates and tourism bosses are upbeat and say itaposs not too late to book a winter trip.Anti-vax protests are happening inItalyover Covid passes, but tourists who are fully vaccinated can enter. A negative Covid test  hours before departure is also required.The countryaposs Prime Minister Mario Draghi says visitors are very welcome.InSpain, Covid numbers have risen, but fully-jabbed Brits with proof of a negative test are allowed in and no Covid passes are required for indoor public places.The countryaposs tourism minister Reyes Morato says the more tourists, the merrier. From Wednesday inPortugal, all visitors must also show a negative Covid test before leaving for the country.Similar to most European countries, a recent negative Covid test result is needed for indoor places and Covid passes shown for entry to bars and restaurants.

Members managed to elect a new committee and secure time to be able to carry out a structural report for repairs to the clubhouse. Had they been unable to elect a committee the lease would have been lost with the site reverting back to arms- council organisation City Property.Former Scotland and Queens Park player Joseph TaylorIn  Mr Brown, who was then with Hampden Bowling Club, discovered a railway map proving Hampden Bowling Clubrsquos legendary tale and this year digs were carried out in a bid for hard evidence. And with  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international, Mr Brown believes now is the time for Scotlandrsquos contribution to football to be recognised and the site of the first Hampden being protected.Read more:Scotlands first national football ground faces uncertain futureMr Brown leads what has become known as The Hampden Collection and Footballrsquos Square Mile - the Worldrsquos Biggest lsquoOpen Airrsquo football museum in Glasgow which follows the discovery of the foundation stone of the Worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground.Mr Brown, who will bring together a  of guests for the event, said: ldquoThe next stage of the footballing journey is to get the entire st Hampden Site recognised as the epicentre of World Football. However, to do that, and to bring the story to le, we have brought in a number of other sites that have huge signicance in the story of football, and as launched earlier this year, created the worldrsquos biggest open air football museum.ldquoIn our opinion, this is the way to stamp Scotlandrsquos claim, and also brings huge amount of opportunity to tell this story. Footballrsquos Square Mile is the way to do it and the campaign to make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site will be launched this week which will be one year to go until the th anniversary of the worlds first international football match.Joseph Taylors great grandson Colin discovered the grave in Cathcart CemeteryMr Brown realises it will be a dficult process, but says they are ready for the campaign.ldquoWith the timing and signicant dates next year, along with the possibility that Scotland could be playing at the World Cup, we want to put the spotlight on just how important the discovery of the first Hampden and Footballrsquos Square Mile is. If this was anywhere  in the world that could lay claim to the beginning of football as we know it, it would be a world tourist attraction so why not here.Carrying out a geophysical survey, as well as excavating six trenches in the Queens Park Recreation Ground and Kingsley Gardens site, the archaeologists revealed evidence of the foundations of the first Hampden Park pavilion where the first players to play for Queens Park and Scotland would have got changed before matches and where the team officials would have sat.One of the sites on the Hampden walking tourThey also found tantalising evidence of the original playing surface, sealed beneath over a century of earth and grass, as well as numerous artefacts dropped by the early supporters including beer bottles, juice bottles and clay pipes.Dr Paul Murtagh, Senior Project Officer at Archaeology Scotland who managed the st Hampden Dig Team, said the project was unique in more ways than one as it brought people together.Dr Murtagh said: ldquoThis was a project which was part of Archaeology Scotlandrsquos New Audience Project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland, and brought people from dferent backgrounds and nationalities together. Football was the hook for this and while it not be their own countryrsquos heritage they were helping to establish part footballing heritage.ldquoWe were very lucky to have records to got on but it was when we dug the trenches and with the use of geophysics we could really pinpoint the site. The findings, which included artefacts from people who would have stood on the terraces, really give you something tangible from that moment in time.A group enjoying the Hampden tourGlasgow Football Tour founder Lindsay Hamilton had been aware of the myth surrounding the site of the first Hampden Park, but like many people didnrsquot think much more of it.It was only when Mr Brown approached her to consider working on a Hampden walking tour that she found out more.ldquoIrsquove been offering tours around Glasgowrsquos five main stadiums for many years and I love telling people about our footballing heritage, said Ms Hamilton. ldquoBefore covid I had been taking tourists from all over the world to Hampden Park, Ibrox Stadium, Celtic Park, Cathkin Park and Firhill as well as part of a -minute minibus tour.ldquoGraeme was on my first tour and I remember him saying to me do you want to help me save Hampden Bowling Club and I wondered what he was talking about, but it was the rumour that it was the site of the first Hampden which Graeme then went on to find the map from the National Records of Scotland which showed where it would have been.Due to covid restrictions Ms Hamiltonrsquos minibus tours of the football grounds couldnrsquot go ahead, so a walking tour of the Hampden sites was developed.ldquoThe idea came about for the walking tour bringing in the three Hampden sites and was a chance to be able to tell the story of and signicance of the beginning of world football and the game we know today, Ms Hamilton added.ldquoPeople were keen to get outdoors and embraced walking more during lockdown and we ran nine walking tours this year. When you tell people about the history behind the first Hampden Park they are in disbelief. I think people on the tour, who were all Scottish as we still didnrsquot have international visitors at the time, felt very proud and we want people to go on tell the story and pass it on. The first Hampden needs to be protected and should be celebrated as the site where the modern game watched by billions around the world began.One football fan who joined the tour had a particular interest in Scotlandrsquos football heritage as he is very much part of it.Colin Taylor, the great grandson of Joseph Taylor, was drawn to the tour on his first trip to Glasgow to investigate his football history.ldquoI was always told as a youngster that Joseph Taylor played football for Queens Park, Colin said. ldquoLater I was told he also played for Scotland, but kind of took that with a pinch of salt. When my father passed away in  I started to get interested in family history and with my fatherrsquos brother, my paternal uncle, who was by then in his mid s, started looking through old photos and we found one of Joseph and one of his grave. My uncle said he had looked for Josephrsquos grave in the rsquos but assumed it was in Langside and thought it had been lost during bombing in the Second World War.Ten yearsrsquo ago Colin discovered the location of Taylorrsquos grave by accident.Colin added: ldquoIt was a simple email to Cathcart, I emailed every cemetery in Glasgow, and I discovered where he rested. I was also contacted by the historian Andy Mitchell who sent me more information on Joseph and a photo of his grave.ldquoI saw an opportunity this year after lockdown to go to Scotland for a few days and visit Josephrsquos grave and visit Hampden. I was intrigued by the three Hampdenrsquos story and the discovery of the very first Hampden.ldquoI joined a walking tour in September and I achieved my ambition of seeing Josephrsquos grave, seeing the original Hampden where he played, and Queenrsquos Park where he also played and practised.I could feel goosebumps looking at the old pavilion at the bowling club and imagining Joseph not only playing there but also being instrumental in some major decisions as he was president of Queens Park for a year after he finished playing in ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13244774.jpg?type=article-full","title":"heritage-buffs-christmas-gift-guide","story":"The Real Mary Kingrsquos Close voucherSome say itrsquos haunted.

number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is ldquohuge international concern surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective, and it may hinder one of the UKrsquos Covid treatments, Ronapreve.Ministers were facing calls to go further to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case.Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group

there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an ldquoincreased risk of reinfection and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a ldquogrowth advantage.Novavax said it has ldquoalready initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B... and will have it ready to begin testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks.Moderna said: ldquoSince early , Moderna has advanced a comprehensive strategy to anticipate new iants of concern.ldquoThis strategy includes three levels of response should the currently authorized  microgbooster dose of mRNA- prove insufficient to boost waning immunity against the Omicron iant.Pfizer and BioNTech said that in the event of a iant which could escape the effects of the vaccines, the firm expects ldquoto be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval.AstraZeneca said it has ldquodeveloped, in close collaboration with Oxford University, a vaccine  that enables us to respond quickly to new iants that may emerge and is ldquoalready conducting research in locations where the iant has been identied.The firm is also testing its antibody combination drug against the new iant and is ldquohopeful it ldquowill retain efficacy since it comprises two potent antibodies with dferent and complementary activities against the virus.Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the Omicron iant.He told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that most of the mutations are in similar regions seen in other iants so far, adding: ldquoThat tells you that despite those mutations existing in other iants the vaccines have continued to prevent serious disease as wersquove moved through Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.ldquoAt least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new iant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed.ldquoItrsquos extremely unlikely that a reboot of a pandemic in a vaccinated population like we saw last year is going to happen.Prof Pollard said a new vaccine to combat Omicron could begin ldquovery rapidlyrequired.ldquoThe processes of how one goes about

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

Nine-year old Casper came into Ballymena Rehoming Centre in July . He didn’t enjoy le in kennels so was placed into foster care and has settled well into le with his caring foster family. But as he can find change a worry, it’s time for Casper to move for the final time into a permanent new home. Stephanie Scott, Home from Home Co-ordinator at Ballymena said: “Casper is a very sweet natured boy with a lovely character who loves playing with his toys especially a ball. “He also has a sensitive side where he can be shy and anxious about open spaces and leaving what he considers to be his safe places. “We noticed this when he first came into kennels when he didn’t want to leave his kennel, so we felt that he would cope better in a foster home and he is enjoying le with his foster family who are patient and kind. “However, placing a dog in a foster home is only ever a temporary measure so it is now time for Casper to find his new family.“Casper is happy and content when he spends time with his foster family in the house or garden but upon leaving this space for walks he can become nervous. “We think many people will be able to relate to Casper’s worries following the pandemic when going out into the world again can lead to anxiety.“Casper very much enjoys company and is an affectionate dog once he knows you. “He likes someone being around most of the time and in his foster home he likes to sleep in the bedroom area. We know that whoever rehomes Casper will be getting a devoted canine pal for le.”Casper requires a quiet, adult only home as the only pet. A secure garden is essential so he can play in his safe space.Anyone interested in rehoming Casper can contact the Ballymena Rehoming Centre on   .

I didn’t come in for Black Friday especially, I just happened to be in the town.”Picking up the best deals wasn’t the number one priority, with the biting, blustery winds focusing Francine’s mind where.“I’m off to get a nice warm cup of tea,” she laughed.Nearby, friends Victoria Smith and Rebecca Thomas had hit the ground running with their hands full of shopping bag and one particular store had them parting with their hard-earned money.“There were some great discounts on their gt sets and things like that,” said Victoria.Rebecca added: “It’s been a pretty good Black Friday.”Belfast retailers, many of whom have been financially hit hard by the impact of lockdown restrictions, will have their fingers crossed they can say the same when they come to tally up the takings.  Most ReadPrincipal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Where old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadOrganisers of loyalist event in Co Tyrone ‘were not to blame for sectarian incidents’Warning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Top VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen lands - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"PlayJody Waterworth on BBC Hope Street filming in DonaghadeePlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKLatest Northern IrelandHome of Ulster Rugby hosts Covid- vaccine clinicStormont’s £k spend on vaccine ad campaignDeclaration opposing the Brexit Protocol signed in  Orange HallsTributes to ‘renowned educationalist’ who died after car was hit by falling treeSlaughtneil role a real honour, says pregnant Siobhán Bradley ahead of Ulster Camogie finalLatestManchester City boss Pep Guardiola vows not to manage another club in EnglandTesting for arrivals to UK ‘huge blow’ to travel industryBelenenses-Benfica abandoned as Covid outbreak causes chaosGeorge Clooney – I was waiting for my switch to turn off after motorbike crashStars removed from I’m A Celebrity castle after production base damaged in storm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Martin McKeownGillian AndersonNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA council investigation into reports of sectarian singing and comments at a young loyalist event in Co Tyrone has cleared the organisers of blame.The report concluded that while the incidents at the event organised by Castlederg Young Loyalists on July  in Castlederg were ‘unfortunate, it could not be determined to be a fault of the organisers’.However, councillors decided not to accept the officer’s recommendation to award the funding which had previously been withheld. A new investigation into the incident will now be held.Sinn Fein councillor Ruairi McHugh had previously raised the matter at the July council meeting, describing the event as descending into a ‘sectarian hatefest’. He also pointed out that the council-maintained car park was ‘bedecked in loyalist and unionist flags and paraphernalia’.The concert, at Albert Street car park in Castlederg, had been allocated £, from the council’s Good Relations Fund. Councillors voted in favour of the investigation with the funding withheld until the outcome was reported.In a report to the health and communities committee, it noted that members should “approve that Grant Aid payments are made to Castlederg Young Loyalists in line with the terms and conditions of their Letter of Offer within the Good Relations Grant Aid Programmes”.It added: “The organisers are aware that an inidual, under the influence of alcohol, made sectarian comments following a performance by one of several acts on the night of July .

We haven’t spoken to anyone outside the event organisers about this.”Defending the report UUP Alderman Derek Hussey said: “I am disappointed with some of the rhetoric around this and the vilication of the organisers of this event on the back of a report which is a very factual account of events as I have heard.DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the report clearly states “there was no breach in terms and conditions”.Members voted against the officer’s recommendation to award the funding with three for, seven against and one abstention.

It is their intention to align Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK on PCR testing and self-isolation requirements for new arrivals, they said.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said the emergence of the omicron iant is a serious and concerning development following the extreme pressures already faced during the course of the Covid- pandemic to date.Whilst it is highly likely that there will be cases of the iant in NI at some point it is essential that preventative measures are taken to delay and or reduce its incursion. This is a rapidly developing situation with the potential need for the addition of more countries to the Red List in the coming days, he said.Dr McBride concluded: “It is really important that everyone takes sensible precautions - get a PCR testyou have symptoms. self-isolate when asked and wear your face-covering.

Can cowboy test firms set up with little more than a website in the spare room be trusted to protect public health — Rory BolandNovember , Scientists believe increased testing will give time to better understand the risk Omicron might pose before the iant becomes more widespread in the UK.Dr Nathalie MacDermott, National Institute for Health Researchacademic clinical lecturer at King’s College London, said: “The action to ban flights from the most affected countries is never a decision that should be taken lightly.“But for a brief period it can buy the time needed to better understand the threat posed by this new iant and ensure the implementation of more robust identication and targeted contact tracing for iniduals arriving from those countries now placed on the red list.“The decision by the Government to re-implement the need for a PCR test from all iniduals arriving in the UK from abroad on day two, with self-isolation until a negative test is reported, while frustrating for those travelling, is essential in order to rapidly identy cases of infection with the Omicron iant and implement prompt isolation and targeted contact tracing to limit the spread of the iant in the UK.”Concerns have also been voiced about whether the testing industry can meet a sudden rise in testing demand.Which  travel editor Rory Boland said travellers will understand the need for restrictions, but the private testing industry which they will have to rely on “isn’t fit for purpose”.“Testing firms have struggled to provide tests on time over the past year, so it is hard to have confidence they will be able to cope with this spike in demand at short notice,” he said.“Now that the Government has taken the decision to make PCR tests mandatory, it must take steps to properly regulate the marketplace and implement the CMA’srecommendations so that consumers can have confidence they are booking with a provider they can rely on.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

His father, who died suddenly in March , competed in triathlons for Ireland and was a member of the North West Triathlon Club. Dannyhas now raised over pound, for mental health and wellbeing organisations across the city. Over his -day challenge, people from across the city and district joined him for sections of his challenge, with others lining routes to cheer him on. Danny thanked the people of Derry saying they “lted him up, and filled him with adrenaline.” He said: “Thank you all so much, from the bottom of my heart, from the sweat on my brow to the blisters on my feet, thank you. And of course, to my daddy, I hope I made you proud big man. Danny spent much of the year training for thechallenge starting on August , which consisted of a. mileswim, followed by a milecycle and then a milemarathon, every day for  consecutive days. At a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Thursday, a motion proposed by Sinn Feacuteins Christopher Jackson and Sandra Duffy, calling for the honour to be bestowed on Mr Quigley, passed unanimously. Councillor Jackson said: “The challenge itself caught the imagination of the city and the most important element of it is the promotion of positive mental health. Danny has raised over pound, for local mental health charities and he has created a lasting legacy. This motion is a way ofacknowledgingDanny, his family and all the supporters that helped him complete this task. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane and DUP Councillor Graham Warke said Danny has brought a city together and said it was something that was very much needed” during such a dficult time. “I’ve never seen anyone  do that,” he said, “The money and awareness he has raised, he is a credit to everybody and to his family.” Sandra Duffy added: “The work that he has done and the awareness he has raised has been absolutely tremendous.“We have a really ordinary citizen who has done an extraordinary thing.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Ballyarnett men spent the first half in almost total control, leading - to - at the first half water break and pushing on to open up a - to - gap at half time. Cootehill were a side transformed after the break though, and quickfire points from Fiachra Hughes, Mark Moffett and goalkeeper Niall Clerkin saw them close the gap.

It’s a fairly cringeworthy experience watching so many people pretend to like each other and dance and act like they’re not in it for the next round. The reason I get so worked up about it is that I was watching musicians for years and years, before the Arts Council handed out cheques, just making great music. Some of them still do. Jeanette Hutton still does. I’ll end up sounding like a lick but it’s a small price to pay to get across her importance to music here. The easiest way to explain her is that she’s the real thing. An incredible vocalist that you’ve undoubtedly heardyou were ever out on a Saturday night in Derry. A gted songwriter that has changed yet again for her third record. An irreplaceable friend and all-round cool girl with the best taste in music you’re going to find. A genuinely fine human being.She once told me that hearing Let There Be Rock by AC DC on Tommy Vance’s rock show inspired her to pursue music and to join Philby, who toured with Mama’s Boys and played with Rory Gallagher. Philby gained a local following which got bigger and bigger and that eventually meant they could buy a transit van and move to London . But the dficulties of constant touring around a circuit that covered a lot of distance around England with little to no pay to, even worse, pay-to-play gigs caught up with them and the band parted ways. Not that this was a bad experience and the band had gained enough acclaim to get write ups in Kerrang magazine and gigs in the famous Marquee venue in London . After a year out back home, Jeanette got involved in a local jam session with Frankie Robinson and Mickey the Hat and that has developed into her becoming one of the most recognised and respected musicians in the town. This led to her band Lady J’S first album with husband Ruairi O’Doherty, bassist David Doherty and guitarist Marty McGill and produced the self-titled album and some of the best gigs the parish has seen. Like I said earlier, this lady, J, has the best taste in music you’ve ever heard, and she took an absolute swerve in her next project with her sister Noella. Blood, the album and the live experience was all things to all music fans, loud and acoustic, heavy, and sweet, lyrical, and melodic set against loud guitars, quiet guitars and familial vocal harmonies that can only be captured by relatives. The perfect storm and another chapter in the book of big Hutton. Now we’re at the next chapter, the one where it’s just Jeanette. “Melancholy Me” is described a collection of dark, reflective, and weighty tunes that showcases her as a more introspective writer with brooding stories to tell. I’ve always found her music to be like that, the delivery is ever changing in a way that a great musician seems to be able to do that without taking a wrinkle out of them but the over-arching substance that fills her songs is a constant. There are a lot of musician and listeners out there who have a lot to learn from Lady J Hutton. Keep up to date with all happenings Hutton on her Facebook page, Jeanette Hutton Music. She’ll also be supporting Damien Dempsey in the Millennium Forum on Saturday th January and tickets can be got for that herewww.millenniumforum shows damien-dempsey .

These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .

Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him.

John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Written by Johnny Gogan and Brian Leyden and directed by Gogan, the film was produced by Dromahair-based Bandit Films. The film was scored by Sligo’s Glenn Garrett, edited by Dromahair-based Patrick O’Rourke and shot by Strandhill videographer Peter Martin. Black Ice tells the story of Alicewho is drawn into the clandestine boy - and girl - racing scene where Jimmyis considered top dog among the petrol heads in a fictional Donegal border community. Their relationship and their attempts to get into the legitimate rallying scene are undermined by forces at work in this shadowy border world threatening their ambition, the town where they live and, ultimately, Alice’s family. Black Ice received a wide release in Ireland in  and was one of the best Irish performers at the box office and on DVD that year. The film received repeat broadcasts on RTEacute. The film’s release on Netflix follows the recent release of Johnny Gogan’s feature documentary Hubert Butler Witness to the Future on the streaming service. The film will now be available - in multiple languages - across Netflix’ European network Johnny Gogan s to Donegal for the commencement of his new novel Station to Station. The pacy thriller about a rogue Irish diplomat commences and revisits at ious points in the narrative, Donegal’s Lough Derg pilgrimage island. Station to Station which featured at the recent Allingham Festival is centred around the uncovering of the corruption around a rather unique Irish-Spanish property deal on the south coast of Spain. Published by Lepus Print, the book is available through independent book shops in Donegal and nationally. Johnny Gogan’s other feature drama work includes The Bargain Shop , The Last Bus Home , Mapmakerand the drama-documentary Prisoners of the Moon . The release of his feature documentary Groundswell earlier this year was welcomed by ’s Chief Film Critic Peter Bradshaw as “a lesson to communities there and everywhere  to stay vigilant”.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportDungiven master the elements to seal back-to-back Jack Cassidy titles overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always.

Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know.

Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

The southern team was trying to reach the world cup finals while the Ulstermen wanted to give their manager, Billy Bingham, a fitting send offThe southern team was trying to reach the finals of the tournament in the United States, while the Ulstermen wanted to give their legendary manager, Billy Bingham, a fitting send off as he retired from international football.I was there and the atmosphere was competitive, on and off the pitch. When Northern Ireland’s striker, Jimmy Quinn, sent a volley arcing past Pat Bonner’s outstretched glove in the second half, Windsor Park erupted with joy.The theme song that night, ‘There’s only one team in Ireland,’ had already been firmly established.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The chant had been heard first in Dublin, when the Republic’s fans taunted northerners during a - win. That mockery hurt, because Northern Ireland was traditionally the dominant force in Irish football, qualying for international tournaments while the south struggled. Now that Northern Ireland had taken the lead against Jack Charlton’s side the song was redeployed. The stands at Windsor Park shook with noise, as the Green and White Army reminded their rivals that theirs was the original Irish football team veterans of three World Cups and reigning Home Nations champions.Billy Bingham, the Northern Ireland manager, was retiring from international footballUnfortunately, minutes later, the Republic equalised and secured their place in the US. I still maintain that goal came from a free-kick that should not have been given. Nigel Worthington shoulder-charged Eddie McGoldrick perfectly fairly, but the referee decided otherwise.These are the decisive moments that haunt fans, but they are part of the game and the Republic was deservedly destined for New York. The saddest thing was that Bingham did not get the winning end that his career deserved. However, his team had restored a lot of pride with its battling performance. Of course, Northern Ireland was a troubled place in November . The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist attacks like the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel massacre. Northern Ireland fans at the November  game at Windsor Park. The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist massacres yet the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinisterDespite this deeply unpromising context, the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinister. I was only a teenager, but I had already seen more vitriol at club games and I would do so many more times in the years to come. That’s why I was delighted to read Mark Rainey’s two page spread, in Wednesday’sNews Letter , about the myth that Windsor Park was a cockpit of hatred that night. He explained in detail how the hood got started. The Republic’s manager, Jack Charlton, believed that Northern Ireland should have gone easy on his team. Famously, after the final whistle, he said, “Theybattled too hard... They will get no favours from us... ever.”This typically graceless comment set in train a series of inventions, distortions and exaggerations that were repeated asthey were gospel by generations of players, fans and commentators.As Mark noted rightly, none of these accusations were levelled at the home fans in the immediate aftermath of the match.Many of the modern preconceptions about Northern Ireland fans’ conduct seem to have arisen from the Marie Jones’ play, A Night in November. Soon these details were cited by pundits who were nowhere near Windsor Park, but who nevertheless portrayed it as a bastion of bigotry.The contrast between what I saw that evening and the hysteria that followed made a strong impression on me, even as a schoolboy. It showed me vividly thata myth was repeated often enough in Northern Ireland it became accepted as fact, not just by its nationalist inventors, but by neutrals and well-meaning unionists too. Even Northern Ireland’s advocates now tell a story about how fans transforming their behaviour after this supposed “night of hate”. This narrative highlights the way the atmosphere at Windsor Park changed over many decades, becoming more inclusive and family friendly, but it repeats a caricature that was never fair or real.Football fans have rarely behaved perfectly. They are passionate, get carried away and sometimes act aggressively and badly. No doubt, some Republic fans found the atmosphere at Windsor Park in  unpleasant or uncomfortable. They were not, it must be said, supposed to be in the stadium in the first place.The myth of the “night in November” has been perpetuated for so long that it is now unlikely ever to be dispelled. Thank goodness that a journalist has the courage to challenge it and explain its origins. It will mean a lot to very many people.

Latest news bulletins are reporting ever increasing numbers of confirmed cases of Covid- in the last few days causing hospitals and intensive care units to be overwhelmed, indeed to breaking point. Millions, many of them children, remain unvaccinated in impoverished countries, and at huge risk to infection, serious illness, and death.

That is also the message of today’s gospel narrative. Even in the midst of the world’s confusion and chaos, Jesus reassures us: “The Kingdom of God is near”. As dficult as it may sometimes be to discern its presence. Our Lord faced turbulent times as well – born of parents forced to seek shelter for the night in a cow shed – not exactly the palace of a prince or king. Yet, the surprise of Christ’s incarnation forces us to look again in our own age at the “signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars”, and to consider anew the signs of God’s involvement in the world about us.Advent is the season when we learn to overcome our “fear and foreboding” and once more open our hearts to others just as God has disclosed and demonstrated his love for us in Christ.Advent also reminds us that our spiritual winter will come to an end. The fig tree will again blossom and bloom. “Summer is near,” our Lord reassures us – even at the beginning of Advent. “Our redemption is drawing near.”Amid all the dficulties of this le, when uncertainty and fear loom near, may we ever look to Jesus, and put all our faith and trust in Him, mindful that His word and promise to His people “will not pass away”.Let us remember His timely warning: “Be on your guard”. We must always recall that, as the Gospel reminds us, our Lord will come like a thief in the night, and at a time when we least expect him. As we enter the Advent season, may we be vigilant, awake, and always on our guard for Christ’s ‘Second Coming’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
