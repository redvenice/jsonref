But devolved Scotland adopted the plans.In July 2009, Labour vaunted a \u0027National Care Service\u0027 – which never emerged. It was to be funded by compulsory payments, which led the Tories to describe it as a \u0027death tax\u0027.But then-PM Gordon Brown nixed the plans by delaying them for another five years – in which Labour lost the next election.Earlier this month, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt admitted it was \u0027fair criticism\u0027 to say the Government had kept the public waiting too long for it to carry out its plans on social care.\u0027People have been waiting for promises on care for a long time,\u0027 she said.The comment came after a report by the Lords economic affairs committee, chaired by former Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth.It stated billions of pounds must be spent to restore quality and access in the social care system to an \u0027acceptable\u0027 standard.It suggested introducing free personal care so those with \u0027substantial and critical\u0027 needs can receive help with daily activities. Eventually, by 2025, all elderly people should receive free personal care.Under the Coalition government, a study commissioned led by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot called for a cap on the amount people have to pay for care, proposing that the state step in to pay the rest.         Seeing the bigger picture: Boris, seen in London yesterday, called the dementia care scandal a \u0027crisis in our country\u0027But the proposals were delayed, with the Tories pledging to introduce a £75,000 cap by 2016 – and then 2020. It was then shelved entirely.And Theresa May faced a nationwide backlash during the 2017 election after her plans for social care were branded a \u0027dementia tax\u0027.The party\u0027s manifesto unveiled unpopular proposals ensuring no one has to sell their home to pay for care, and a pledge to protect the final £100,000 of pensioners\u0027 assets.But the blueprint also revealed that the she planned to use decades of rising property values as a way of funding social care.The Manifesto bluntly stated that the elderly should not expect current and future taxpayers to pay for their care, adding: \u0027Many older people have built considerable property assets due to rising property prices.\u0027In addition, thousands of people who rely on home helps would have been asked to contribute towards the cost of their care for the first time.Jeremy Corbyn described the rise as a \u0027tax on dementia\u0027, saying it was unfair that cancer sufferers got free NHS care while those with dementia racked up huge bills.Sir Andrew Dilnot himself said the sky-high costs would leave pensioners \u0027helpless\u0027.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Man self immolates near Japan Embassy amid Seoul Tokyo spat","story":"Share this article If his self-immolation is found to be directly related to the Japanese curbs, it would the first such action in South Korea since anti-Japanese sentiments flared up over the trade restriction.Some activists and residents in South Korea are staging anti-Japan demonstrations and campaigns to boycott Japanese products, but those have been limited so far.South Korea and Japan are both key U.S. allies.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Good news from Kemster, who is “thoroughly enjoying” Frank Herbert’s Dune:World-building and story telling of the highest order and not the “hard” sci-fi tome I was expecting at all. It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book.It’s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I’m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it’s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read!I recently read and loved Emilia Pine’s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections.Meanwhile, greenmill has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre:… having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages. Not my usual thing but thoroughly enjoyed it.Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano has engrossed and challenged writeronthestorm:I’ve almost finished Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano - this is one of the bleakest fiction books I’ve read for quite some time. Yet, it is strangely engrossing. The story centres on what happens to people involved with, or connected to, the abduction of two young boys. The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It’s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff!This Body’s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to pubbore:It’s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I’m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it.Finally, Swelter has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis’ Fiction and the Reading Public:I’m enjoying it immensely. Leavis is a militant and unapologetic champion of the “highbrow”: ‘Those novels which have some pretensions to literary merit and can be criticised by serious standards (it is common even in literary circles to fling the epithet ‘highbrow’ at it).’In order to demonstrate the universality of the belief that, in the 1920s and 1930s, the most popular literature is invariably the worst, she quotes Arnold Bennett (Evening Standard July 19th, 1928):‘Nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.’Elsewhere she accuses Bennett’s literary column of being one of the forces, along with book-of-the-month clubs, that perpetuate and codify “middlebrow” literature.Nearly all bookish people are snobs? What kind of know-nothing would write that?If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The measures include restricting novice drivers to driving in daylight hours. They’re also proposing a minimum age for passengers.It all sounds as tediously sensible as you’d expect from the Department for Transport, which is the sexier cousin of the Department for Work and Pensions but is positively dowdy compared with the rippling muscles and aviators of the Ministry of Defence, and a full-on nerd when compared with my favourite department, the Ministry of Sound.Newer drivers tend to be younger drivers, so this policy change is going to affect them the hardest. When I was young, my car was everything to me. It was a red and white Citroën 2CV and instead of being able to transport a basket of eggs across a ploughed field unbroken (weird brag, France, but each to their own), it would mainly transport giddy teenagers to the local beach for parties. Yes, the speedometer only went up to 60, and yes the heater was as effective as a hotel hairdryer, but this car was a lifeline, not to mention also a place to have sex. So multifunctional.Growing up on Anglesey, north Wales, we had the luxury of stunning scenery and a community spirit, but that was somewhat offset by transport services more infrequent than my teenage period. Driving at 17 was the difference between having a job and not, as well as allowing me to socialise (camping overnight in a field while drinking cider and playing Green Day on an acoustic guitar – badly) with my far-flung mates. Isolation is a huge problem in rural communities and a car allowed me to grow up in a group of loving friends. We were all reliant on the three drivers in our social group to get us around, driving our friends to cultural events (sounds better than illegal raves), university open days and, if we were feeling really spicy, Liverpool.As the area’s primary industry is tourism, most jobs you could get as a teenager were in hospitality, which meant you stayed at work until the families from Manchester on the nearby caravan park were ready to stop drinking Soave. Not only were the buses infrequent, they didn’t run until 2am, which could be when you finished your shift. For so many of us a car meant being able to work and afforded us an independence – financially and socially. I saved up the money from my job and was able to pay for my accommodation in university with it. If I didn’t have that money, I wouldn’t have been able to go, would never have discovered the glory of Super Noodles and fishbowls, and wouldn’t be working my dream job now.Please also spare a thought for these teenagers who would become completely reliant on their parents to pick them up from gigs. There is no bigger buzzkill when you leave a gig, giddy and full of adrenaline, than when the first face you see upon leaving is your stony-faced mother blasting Michael Bolton out the car.Driving at night in the country is easier. We specialise in blind corners and single-track winding roads. In the daytime you crawl around these and honk your horn hoping no one is coming the opposite way. At night headlights let you know if someone is coming the other way or – also useful – if there are doggers in the lay-by.• Kiri Pritchard-McLean is a standup comedian and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f5ee83b384017653b579669445c989124dddd49/0_60_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087088c4b064df01284495903035cbb2","title":"i was insta famous and it was one of the worst things to happen in my 20s","story":"You get trapped in your own triviality, in the mind numbing packaging and distribution of the minutiae of your dayNothing messes you up quite so royally as becoming Insta-famous.It’s just as bad as genuine fame, only without the public fawning or free Fendi sports bras to soften your descent into self obsession, insecurity and casual bitchiness.Of course you don’t realise it. You’re busy preaching love, harmony and laxative tea. Plus you’re distracted by every brick wall or passing dog that you could drag in to your #candid shots of you laughing maniacally while holding a conveniently placed (and delicious!) protein shake.I used to be Insta-famous and it was one of the worst things to happen in my 20s. While I did gain a very photogenic selection of free protein powder, it was probably one of the most gruelling, confusing and miserable times of my life.It happened almost accidentally. A few years ago, I had freshly graduated from university and was busy bumming around my student flat when I got a call asking me to move to New Zealand and present on the flagship daily breakfast TV show. I was 21, it was my first real job, and I didn’t even have an Instagram then let alone any aspirations of pastel filtered fame.So I said yes, moved countries and started an account with a vague idea it’d be good to have “for my brand”. And by virtue of being on national TV every morning, I went from nothing to having over 8,000 combined followers across my “channels”.I became a bonafide influencer, getting sent everything from fancy undies to cell phones, and curating every moment of my peachy life with painstakingly casual captions. It was awful. Primarily because I was awful.Insta-fame has a phenomenal, if unsurprising, capacity to turn you into a dick.We all know that real fame is dangerous. It showers you with attention, making you feel as though you are incredibly important and interesting because all these people are paying attention to you.Instafame does all of this. I became convinced that I was so fascinating. If I was the centre of attention on my phone, that should translate into being the centre of attention in real life. It makes you the worst kind of dick: entitled, self obsessed, and incredibly dull because the only thing you think about is yourself. And it wasn’t helped by being in my 20s and so naturally inclined to think the world revolves around me anyway.But it’s also a particularly vicious type of fame because it’s so insecure. Insta-fame is right at the bottom of the glitter hierarchy, widely acknowledged by the genuinely famous as the most fickle and unearned glory – even more than Love Island. You can see where they’re coming from. Most real world famous people earn fame by doing their job really well. But for influencers, your butt shots are your business. So we’re are constantly aware of the tenuousness of our fame, which makes us even more desperate to hold on to it.It’s also the most numbly exhausting job I’ve ever done. Normally it takes at least five hours to do a professional photo shoot. When you’re an influencer, you need this level of quality but don’t have a team behind you so it becomes incredibly time consuming.You get trapped in your own triviality, in the mind numbing packaging and distribution of the minutiae of your day. It’s real joy killer. Normally you take a photo because you want to capture a great moment, right? But as an influencer you have to manufacture those moments, stripmining the fun out of coffee dates because you’re managing the scene like Annie Leibovitz – if Annie Leibovitz was a basic bitch with a passion for latte art.But the very worst, most dangerous part of instafame in your 20s is that it totally messes up your character development. Not only did it make me self obsessed, but it indulged my very worst qualities.Social media feeds those darkest parts of every personality, encouraging you to rant on Twitter, brag on Facebook, or be vain on Insta. Vanity sells on the ‘Gram. The hotter the pic, the better it does, so the more time you spend in the mirror creating them. Staying Instafamous relies on you mining the depths of your own narcissism.The problem is that your 20s you’re busy working out who you want to be. A big part of that process is managing and squashing down the dark parts of yourself to make more room for your better parts. But Instafame fed my own vanity and insecurity until it became almost impossible to control them and make space for my better self.So I stopped. I’ve still got Instagram, but I’m officially an ex-influencer. I stopped posting as much and lost a lot of followers, and I deleted most of my classic influencer shots in a fit of self disgust.I realised in order to stay Insta-famous I’d have had to nurture the most pathetic parts of my own psyche. And honestly, no amount of free ombre activewear is worth that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1d59af0f9a81315806d431c2c836bf2a989798/0_323_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5066a45d4ae04a894c713ef9404a320","title":"mooncup menstrual period reliable tampoon eco friendly","story":"If you’re a -reading woman of a certain age, it’s likely you’ll have been party to the evangelical Mooncup rant. In the Mooncup rant, one woman tells the other about a convex piece of medical-grade silicone that has saved her life. She uses it each time she gets her period, and spends the rest of her time talking about it. The cup has saved her thousands, is proof of her eco credentials and is now, essentially, the best thing ever.I’m relatively new to menstrual cups, turning to them two years ago after an organic tampon company’s cardboard applicators injured my gentlest parts. And I’ve got the devotion of a convert, regularly proselytising about my Mooncup with all the spittle-flecked frenzy of a televangelist. A new study published by the Lancet this week has proved my claims. Researchers from the Medical Research Council, the Department for International Development and the Wellcome Trust found that menstrual cups were just as reliable as tampons.I’ll acknowledge there are obstacles to Mooncup usage – some women aren’t comfortable with using internal menstrual products. And some women live in places without access to the running water required to sterilise menstrual cups. These women may prefer to use pads, and might find period absorption knickers a more appropriate reusable alternative.Many women in the UK, I’d hazard, are in neither camp. Yet Mooncups still seem iffy. The ecological argument is well-worn: Mooncups save the planet’s landfills from the scourge of cotton slabs, fiddly plastic tampon plungers and supposedly discreet packaging that glows with all the luminescence of a bag of Tangfastics. But this adds to the unfair pressure on women (who use makeup wipes and nappies and plastic straws way more than men do) to cut out single-use plastics.So my sermon is the simple fact that my Mooncup brought me closer to my body. The stigma of periods hasn’t precluded me from writing about it for a national newspaper, but still, I appreciate that a Mooncup can be transported and inserted silently, unlike tampons with their noisy wrappers.Furthermore, for me, using tampons could sometimes be quite painful. The Mooncup takes a little getting used to but sits easier, and I’m more in touch with it when it needs changing. Rather than adding to landfill I pour my blood down the toilet, and as it tumbles through the water like red clouds I can see my body has done something natural, and beautiful. My cup comes with a Plimsoll line, so I can tell how much I’ve bled, and means I can confidently tell my GP that, yes, I have heavy periods, and, yes, I need those life-saving painkillers, thank you very much.If my Mooncup adoration sounds too loved-up, think of the romance tampon adverts have been selling for decades.

The nightmare scenario is that he has brought to the musical table not the genius of Hey Jude, Here, There and Everywhere and Norwegian Wood, but the creative acumen responsible for the Frog Chorus, Mull of Kintyre and, there’s no easy way to say this, Wonderful Christmastime – the very acumen that, on a personal note, in December 1979 made me contemplate disowning British citizenship and living in Vanuatu.The worry is that, even if the musical proves as dismal as I fear, it will join that erting list headed Oh No! They Didn’t? Yes, I’m Afraid They Did!, that includes the sing-song version of Stephen King’s Carrie (closed after five performances), Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark (closed after three years without recouping its $75m outlay), Doctor Zhivago (closed after 23 performances) and Lestat, Elton John and Bernie Taupin’s attempt to adapt Anne Rice’s vampire novels for the musical stage (closed after 39 performances). The good news for Sir Paul is that, say what you want about any of these flops, I’d rather spend an evening with any one of them than watch Phantom of the Opera again.Writing musical theatre is hard and the cutting room of history is littered with unrealised projects. Whatever happened to Asian Dub Foundation’s opera Gaddafi? Like Larry David’s music-theatre depiction of Salman Rushdie’s years on the run, Fatwa!, it was never realised on stage, though in the latter case, at least, there were enough tunes teased on Curb Your Enthusiasm to warrant an off-Broadway run, though probably not one in Tehran. And even works that entered the repertory can still ruin the careers of talented creatives. Take the improbable subject of PLO terrorists holding a Jewish cruise party hostage. The 1991 opera The Death of Klinghoffer damaged the composer John Adams’ fortunes but obliterated those of the talented poet Alice Goodman, who never wrote for the stage again.There are some things in music that should not happen: Jimmy Page playing classical guitar, the Police doing reggae, Chuck Berry’s My Ding-a-Ling, Robin Thicke. I’m not saying that Sir Paul’s first musical is of such all-round uselessness (that remains to be heard) but his 1993 Liverpool Oratorio, though a commendable monument to civic pride, was called “lacklustre” and “embarrassing” by the ’s critic.But what do critics, those creative eunuchs, know? The Only Fools and Horses musical is still on despite lukewarm reviews, and Hugh Jackman’s film The Greatest Showman has been a popular success after getting a critical shanking. What’s the moral? The paying public have no taste, obviously. And yet, they may compel me to put my scepticism where the sun doesn’t shine.It may not be woeful, not least because the ex-Beatle has been working with Lee Hall, who wrote both the film Billy Elliot and its musical adaptation. What’s more, the project comes with the imprimatur of fellow Liverpudlian and theatre producer Bill Kenwright. Maybe McCartney’s It’s a Wonderful Life and another looming musical by a Liverpudlian troubadour, Elvis Costello’s A Face in the Crowd (based on a story by On the Waterfront screenwriter Budd Schulberg), will be triumphs. Let both prove me wrong.All that said, Sir Paul, if you still need a lyricist to tweak your musical, I’d be honoured to be the Bernie Taupin to your Sir Elton. Already I’ve sketched a few possible numbers. The evil Bedford Falls oligarch Mr Potter’s Nobody Likes Me I Don’t Care will have audiences hissing from the dress circle, especially if it’s sung, as I hope it will be, by the disgraced Radio 5 presenter and Millwall fan Danny Baker. I’ve given the love duet Buffalo Gals a grime makeover, which must be sung by Neneh Cherry and Stormzy. (That’s right, Neneh takes Donna Reed’s role and Stormzy James Stewart’s. Deal with it.) When Stormzy finds something in his pocket and raises it to the spotlight to sing the showstopper Zuzu’s Petals (“Oh, my darling daughter What can I say? I’ve been a total plonker”), you won’t know whether to laugh, cry or ask for your money back (good luck with the last of these).McCartney rightly says that Capra’s film tells “a universal story we can all relate to” and that he was drawn to it as a result. While that explains why he didn’t adapt David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, it is not a good enough reason: if it were, he could just as easily have written Pingu: The Musical or an all singing, all dancing version of Murder on the Orient Express in which Donald Trump is stabbed by every passenger. Both of which I’d rather see.While I applaud him for writing his first musical aged 77, and thereby showing a forbearance that the Who’s Pete Townshend would have done well to share (oh, come on: who listens to Tommy or Quadrophenia in 2019?), I wish he’d written something nearer to home. I would have loved a musical about the Beatles’ breakup, provisionally entitled How Do You Sleep?, or an adaptation of Terence Davies’ heartbreaker Distant Voices, Still Lives, set in the 50s Liverpool that McCartney knew before he became famous. Again, I’m quite prepared to sketch out a few numbers for either, Sir Paul, if you’d fancy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fa6929f03e79198c616ca1df45173bbcc6ae1b/0_3_2846_1707/master/2846.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=dd58d907ddb94da5368991f91808b1ad","title":"litter ally terrifying is cats the creepiest film of the year","story":"The first look at the star-studded big screen take on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical is trending for all of the wrong reasons“This Christmas, you will believe.” With these words, Universal sent its first trailer for Cats out into the Twitterverse – and if a cagier strapline has appeared in modern movie marketing, nothing comes immediately to mind. Don’t believe it now? Fine, you have until Christmas. One the one hand, it sounds a bit like a threat. On the other, maybe it’s more of a plea. “We know it’s a lot to take in right now, but give it a few months: you’ll believe, we promise!”To be fair, they have reason to, er, pussyfoot in their approach: a film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s eternally uncool but commercially deathless musical has been something of an industry joke for decades, most famous, of course, as a symbolic punchline in John Guare’s Upper East Side bourgeoisie satire Six Degrees of Separation. Since then, the essential naffness of Cats – the earnestness of its reconstituted TS Eliot poetry, combined with the clumsiness of its human-feline costumes – has served as satirical fodder in everything from The Simpsons to The Critic to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It’s easy to be cynical about a Cats movie, then, in large part because a Cats movie seemed an absurd impossibility for so long. For all the popularity of its artifice-heavy stage treatment, there didn’t seem to be a workable way of filming a show entirely about cats, but conveyed entirely through human emotion, expression and movement.Who could have guessed that 2019 would be the year to take up this challenge twice over? Tomorrow, Disney’s much ballyhooed “live-action” remake of The Lion King hits cinemas, with its photo-real but computer-generated big cats improbably shaping their mouths around Elton John’s rousing score score. In terms of online buzz, however, its thunder has almost been stolen this week by Cats, finally brought to the screen by the Oscar-winning British director Tom Hooper. It won’t be in cinemas until December, but a calculated one-two punch – yesterday, a gushing behind-the-scenes featurette, today the official trailer in all its gaudy neon-lit glory – has held the internet rapt in semi-morbid fascination.At last, in two short but overwhelming minutes, the question of “how the hell do you make a movie of Cats” has been answered: by slathering an all-star cast that seems to have been assembled through a particularly manic game of Mad Libs (Judi Dench! Jennifer Hudson! Taylor Swift! Idris Elba! Jason DeRulo?) in a generous coat of much-vaunted “digital fur technology” and building extravagantly outsize sets on which they leap and bound and perform thoroughly humanoid choreography. They’re people! But they’re also cats! So the cast member James Corden muses in wonderment in the making-of blurb – he believes, but will we?If the reaction to the trailer so far is anything to go by, the jury is not so much out as agog: in these difficult, polarised times, the internet appears to have miraculously united in a chorus of “what the hell was that?” Returning to the expensive mode of bombast that saw him make a smash hit out of another slow-to-the-screen musical, Les Miserables, Hooper appears to have fashioned the shonkily home-sewn aesthetic of the stage show into a lurid, gleamingly synthetic fantasia of distorted Victorian streetscapes and polis-like milk bars.Yet even the Blade-Runner-meets-Cath-Kidston production design recedes into the background when set against the cats themselves, an ensemble of famous faces eerily superimposed onto lithe hybrid physiques: distinctly human facial features crowned by jaunty cat ears, dancing human limbs and pert derrières disconcertingly giving way to long, snaking tails. Vivid but not tactile, they’re at first glance neither fish nor fowl, let alone feline. Indeed, they look no more persuasively cat-like than the elaborately face-painted stars of the stage show, however much more state-of-the-art their unsettling furry disguise – which is enough to make you wonder whether old-school costuming and makeup wasn’t the way to go on screen after all. Cue your best Jeff Goldblum impression: “Scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.”It’s a sight disorienting enough to distract you from the trailer’s soundtrack, Hudson’s typically full-blooded rendition of the show’s signature ballad Memory. A pretty, wistful reflection on ageing and dilapidation, it sounds beamed in from another universe to the bright, restless, look-at-this-stuff showmanship of the trailer, eager as it is to flash as much of its elaborate novelty as possible in 140 seconds. That’s the rub of trailer editing, of course: whether the film itself will successfully find feeling in its uncanny-valley spectacle very much remains to be seen, though it’s off to a bewildering, even creepy, start.This weekend, we’ll learn whether mass audiences will take singing digital lions to their hearts, despite a chorus of critics’ complaints that the film’s visual effects are almost too evolved for purpose: its wild beasts look so realistic, so animalistic rather than man-like in their facial movement and body language, that they can’t speak, much less sing a song as sappily human as Can You Feel the Love Tonight?, without setting the film’s meticulously constructed universe off-kilter. Cats faces a different challenge: can its deliberately stylised unreality let us in? Amid the general floaty plotlessness of the material – it’s no Les Mis, put it that way – will audiences emotionally invest in these abject, unearthly creatures, either as cats or as extensions of ourselves? Either way, in the words of Hudson’s oddly lipsticked Grizabella, a new day has begun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f174f73f2d15c71c2d024f1eaa747b6dcb0c57c/1_0_1333_800/master/1333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=146b8fd277e836f83104ac7c1e345e5c","title":"cats movie trailer internet reacts horror demented dream ballet","story":"First glimpse of Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson and other stars mutated into cat-sized cats – some wearing fur coats – sparks concern for state of civilisation• Is Cats the creepiest film of the year?The first, furry glimpses of the upcoming live action Cats remake have left viewers distressed and unhappy after its feline creatures were described as “cursed” and nightmarish.The transmogrified CGI human-cat hybrids were unveiled on Thursday night, to widespread horror.On Twitter, many found the mutated dancing forms to be troubling, describing them as “cursed” and “like a Doctor Who episode from 2005”.Cats is the story of a tribe of cats, called the Jellicles, that face a series of difficult life-altering decisions one fateful night.The live-action remake is helmed by Tom Hooper, the Oscar-winning director of The King’s Speech, and stars Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Jason Derulo, Taylor Swift, Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench.But many fans did not appreciate what had happened to these beloved actors – namely, that they had become cats.Others complained about the size of the cats (too small), asked why they had visible breasts, and pointed out they appeared to be wearing the fur of other cats.It had already been revealed in April that the cats in the remake of Cats would be the size of cats.But on Thursday, many asked why such well-known actors of stage and screen had been deformed in such way, rather than just wear costumes like in the original 1981 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.In May, the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie was immediately redesigned, after widespread revulsion at the CGI appearance of Sonic in its first trailer.Director Jeff Fowler announced “changes” would be made due to the reaction to the three-minute clip. ’s Keith Stuart described the main character as “a cheap knock-off Sonic toy your child might win at a fairground stand and then be terrified of”.“The message is loud and clear... you aren’t happy with the design \u0026amp you want changes. It’s going to happen,” Fowler said.Similar controversy erupted over the first trailer for Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, which eventually opened to good reviews.The original musical debuted on the West End in 1981, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and based on a T.S Eliot’s collection of fantasy poems, Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats.Cats is scheduled for release on 20 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c62ba0b40dedab7b8796e43e108e2e27e8ba2c/169_0_788_473/master/788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0566245fcad405ff92336b784b2ef572","title":"feline queasy 10 urgent questions about the cats trailer","story":"If you saw the Cats trailer last night, you won’t have slept and may still be shaking. Here, we begin the process of trying to understand what happenedThere was a time in your life before you saw the Cats trailer. That’s hard to believe, I know. It might feel as if your every waking moment since birth has been plagued by monstrous visions of howling piliferous, sexualised Brundleflies, but I assure you this is merely a blip. Soon, some other supposedly prestigious director will release a trailer for another terrible musical where the cast have been digitised to look nightmarish and half-formed, and you will move on.In the meantime, I have some questions about the Cats trailer.This shouldn’t be difficult. In TS Eliot’s poetry collection Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, the cats are the size of cats. In the stage musical Cats, the cats are the size of people. But here? It’s hard to know. In one shot, a cat just about fits into a standard dustbin (too big for a cat), another gets its paw stuck in a standard mousetrap (the correct size for a cat). Then there’s this shot, where an entire cat is roughly the size of a standard dining knife (too small for a cat, much too small for a cat). How the hell are audiences supposed to enjoy Cats if they’re constantly trying to discern scale, Tom Hooper?Did Dench specifically grow out her fur so that she could cut it off and make it into a coat for her to wear, even though that would be redundant because she was already wearing the fur? Or did she seek out a number of cats with identical fur to hers – maybe even her own relatives – and brutally skin them so she could wear them as a garment? Is Dame Judi Dench the Ed Gein of cats? Logically, it has to be one or the other.“Remember Catwoman? She’s sexy, right?”“Yes Tom, she’s sexy”.“Could we make our cats as sexy as Catwoman?”“I’m not sure that would work, Tom. Catwoman is a woman who simply assumes feline characteristics, whereas the cats in Cats are literally cats.”“I get it. It’s OK to want to have sex with Catwoman, because when she takes her clothes off she’s a naked human being. But it isn’t OK to want to have sex with a cat, because cats are already naked, and if they take their fur off then they’re just pulsating masses of blood and sinew?”“Nah, screw it, let’s give them tits anyway.”By now, Rebel Wilson has played the exact same character in about 300 films. The repetition of having to be the clumsy, too-confident, overweight comic relief again and again, no matter the film, must be exhausting. So she must have been thrilled to get a call to play a role in a tentpole film by the Oscar-winning director of Les Misérables. Except, oh, wait, no, she’s playing the exact same character in this as well. Still, at least this character is covered in a kind of harrowing woodland moss. That’s something, right?Finally, a question with an answer. James Corden did not vomit into another cat’s face. James Corden spat food into another cat’s face. I hope this helps.Jason Derulo, performer of hits like Swalla, Wiggle and That’s My Shhh? Jason Derulo, deliverer of the lyric “Is it weird that your bra reminds me of a Katy Perry song”? Jason Derulo, whose biggest screen role until now has been playing Ronald Dawson in one episode of the little-loved television adaptation of Lethal Weapon? Yes. That Jason Derulo.Hugely. Enormously. With every atom of her being. Hudson’s rendition of Memory in the Cats trailer – performed in the manner of someone standing on a motorway bridge trying to warn motorists of a cow in the road – is clearly meant to be this film’s answer to Anne Hathaway’s I Dreamed a Dream moment in Les Misérables. That performance won Hathaway an Oscar. However, that was because Hathaway was playing an orphaned sex worker who has to sell her own teeth to feed her daughter, set against the backdrop of France’s violent June Rebellion and not, say, a funny cat in a film about cats.Oh, that’s right, I’m involuntarily peeling the skin off them because apparently that sensation is preferable to looking at any more footage of screaming, digitally augmented, uncanny valley feline hell-mutants. This trailer made me vomit, and wet myself, and now I’m peeling the skin off my own hands. Are you happy now, Tom Hooper?• Cats is in cinemas in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9046b3d283798ac48209f82fc05ba2b3be8c9e9/0_1310_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4b2cdda6ce60c149ea597571ed7cc5f","title":"anna jones summer salad recipes","story":"Two herby summer salads: a party of sweetcorn and tomatoes, with chewy-crisp croutons, and a lentil salad that will put a riot of colours on your tableThis week, two recipes for when you want to spend very little time in the kitchen. There’s one to make when corn is cheap and sweet and tomatoes plentiful, from now until the end of summer.I keep the corn and tomatoes raw here, countering their natural sweetness with a good hit of red-wine vinegar, while the croutons, golden on the outside, chewy on the inside, make this summer salad more of a meal.The second is a herb and lentil dish with an upbeat dressing of ginger and lime that makes the most of soft summer herbs. Fresh, bright and easy eating for summer optimists even when it’s not sunny, we can eat as if it is.I eat this as a lunch or light supper to make it even more substantial, I often pair it with some avocado smashed with a little lime juice and some chopped green chilli. You could also roughly chop a couple of avocados and toss them through the salad, if you like.2 slices good-quality bread (I use sourdough)Olive oilSalt and black pepper2 ears corn500g tomatoes (all shapes, sizes and colours)4 spring onions2 tbsp red-wine vinegar100g toasted almonds50g pecorino (I use a vegetarian one)1 small bunch mint, leaves picked1 small bunch basil, leaves picked50ml extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425F gas 7. Tear the bread into small, rough chunks and lay them on a baking tray. Drizzle generously with olive oil (about four tablespoons) and sprinkle with salt and pepper.Roast for 10-15 minutes – how long you cook them for will depend on the density of your bread. You want the croutons to be crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, so try to take them out before they are hard all the way through.Meanwhile, make the salad. Cut the corn kernels from the ears I do this by resting the end of the corn in a large mixing bowl, which stops the corn from flying everywhere. Cut the tomatoes into bite-sized chunks – it’s nice to keep the shapes and cuts different – and add them to the bowl. Finely slice the spring onions and add these, too. Add a good pinch of salt and pepper, plus the vinegar, and leave to sit for at least 30 minutes.When the croutons are ready, take them out of the oven. Roughly chop the almonds and finely crumble or coarsely grate the pecorino – I like mine crumbled into pieces about the size of a grain of rice.Tear the herbs into the bowl, then add the almonds, cheese and the olive oil, and toss everything together. Finish by tossing the croutons through just before you serve.Here, I use a mixture of herbs I have at home. Any of these will work: coriander, mint, basil, chervil, parsley, tarragon and chives. Picking the leaves into a bowl is a lovely thing to do – you’ll be hit by a wave of fragrance and the bowl will get prettier and prettier as you pick.¼ cucumber, chopped into 5mm dice2 tbsp white-wine vinegarJuice of 1 lemon1 tsp flaky sea salt1 tsp golden caster sugar5 generous handfuls mixed soft herbs1 x 400g tin puy lentils, drained and rinsed50g toasted pistachios, roughly choppedFor the ginger dressingZest and juice of 2 limes3 tbsp olive oil1 green chilli, finely chopped1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped½ tsp tamari or soy sauce1 tsp brown rice vinegar1 tsp runny honey or agave nectar½ thumb-sized piece ginger, peeled1 small garlic clove, peeledSalt and black pepperMix the cucumber in a bowl with the vinegar, lemon juice, salt and sugar. Scrunch well to help begin the pickling, then cover with a plate and set to one side.Roughly pick the leaves from the herbs, discarding any tough stalks, and wash in a bowl of cold water. Lift into a salad spinner, and spin to dry – that way, they’ll retain more of the dressing and won’t wilt immediately, which can sometimes happen when the leaves are wet.Next, make the dressing. Mix the lime zest and juice, olive oil, chilli, shallot, tamari, vinegar and honey in a bowl. Use a fine grater to grate in the ginger and garlic. Mix with a fork and season to taste.Drain the cucumber and pat dry with kitchen paper. Put in a large bowl with the herbs and lentils, toss, add the dressing, and turn it all a few times to coat everything evenly. Sprinkle with the pistachios and serve straight away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab62e05537c0c7c5de76342aa79f4caf36990583/0_0_5832_3500/master/5832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=943a1079bb2901c19fdbc12b5e372acd","title":"lifes too short to bother peeling tomatoes isnt it","story":"Who has the time (or inclination) to blanch, score and peel a pile of ripe tomatoes? Lots of recipes using fresh tomatoes say to blanch and peel them first, but I can never be bothered. Is this culinary sacrilege, and does it actually matter?Ian, GlasgowPerhaps the most important factor determining your response to Ian’s query is how you learned to cook. National culinary treasure Simon Hopkinson, for instance, had a classic old-school chef training, and he definitely isn’t one to cut corners on tomato prep – or on just about anything else, for that matter. And with good reason, he insists: “I always skin, because the skins are said to turn bitter over time, when quietly stewed, for example.” That’s why you never see unskinned tomatoes in a tin or jar, he adds.“If you’re adding coarsely chopped tomato to a stew or vegetable medley – ratatouille or caponata, say – not to skin would be foolish, because those horrid little curled tomato skin ‘needles’ will be riddled throughout the dish.” Not only are these deeply unattractive, he says, but they get stuck in your teeth, too, and no one wants that.Hopkinson is such a stickler, he even peels tomatoes before passing them through an old-fashioned food mill, or mouli-légumes, even though that catches most, if not all, of the skin and pips in its blades anyway. It’s not as if there’s a whole lot of effort involved, he says: “It takes at the very most five minutes to skin six ripe tomatoes. Boil the kettle, put the tomatoes in a bowl, pour over the boiling water, count to 20, drain, then cool under a slow-running cold tap, peeling as you go. There’s no need for any of that ‘bowl of iced water’ nonsense.” Not to skin, in Hopkinson’s book, is not to care.Chef and restaurateur Stevie Parle, on the other hand, takes a slightly more laid-back approach – a graduate of the River Café, he now runs two feted Italian restaurants of his own, Pastaio and Palatino, both in London. “As with everything in cooking,” he says, “you should do whatever you want. But if you don’t peel, you will get tough bits of skin floating about in whatever you’re making. If it’s just one or two tomatoes-worth in a soup, for example, you can just fish them out, but if it’s a beautiful, slow-cooked fresh tomato sauce for pasta, they’ll kind of ruin the effect.”That doesn’t mean Parle’s necessarily a peeler: “The fresh plum tomatoes we get in the UK are as nothing compared with the fully ripe ones that go into jars of hand-peeled San Marzano. But those are crazy-expensive, so I often just use tinned, especially at home.” That said, he adds, “tinned ones usually come drowned in that horrible, thick, tomatoey purée stuff that’s full of sugar, vinegar, preservatives and wotnot, so I wash it off in a sieve. Yes, it’s a bit wasteful – don’t @ me – but you do end up with pretty decent, ripe, peeled cooking toms.” His basic rule of thumb is fresh and skin-on if using tomatoes raw and tinned for cooking.Turkish-Cypriot chef Selin Kiazim is even more in Ian’s can’t-be-faffed-to-peel camp, but then eastern Mediterranean cooking tends to be a bit more rough and ready than its la-di-da western counterparts. “It’s such a hassle!” she says at her latest venture, an offshoot of her Shoreditch restaurant Oklava at new London food court Arcade Food Theatre in Centrepoint, which opens on 22 July. She admits very occasionally to peel really big tomatoes for salads – “I just like the way they absorb the dressing” – but even then, she’s not obsessive about it: “I just pare them with a little knife, like my grandmother did.”And if you feel you really have to peel your tomatoes, for a sauce or soup, say, Kiazim advocates a typically rustic, no-nonsense approach: “Just cut them in half and grate them on the large holes of a box grater.” You’ll be left with a neat pile of pulp, and life’s way too short to throw a wobbler about the odd bit of skin that may creep through."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd8beb97e2ba226ac18af700f1933604120b8ab4/22_164_8059_4837/master/8059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46289aa7b8ef0ff2bb6c175c12fe62c6","title":"plant based milk the choice for almost 25 of britons now","story":"Almost a quarter of Britons are consuming plant-based milk alternatives as the popularity of vegan and vegetarian diets continues to grow.Emma Clifford, associate director of UK food and drink at Mintel, said plant-based milk was entering the mainstream as alternative products became more readily available on supermarket shelves. “This is part of a much wider plant-based movement, driven by concerns around health, ethics and the environment.”In a significant shift in the UK, the number of vegans – those shunning all animal products including dairy and eggs – has risen. According to the Vegan Society, there were 600,000 vegans in Britain in 2018, up from 150,000 in 2014.Oatly’s UK general manager, Ishen Paran, said consumers were thinking carefully about the environmental impact of their purchases, with alternative milks increasingly appealing also to non vegans. “We’ve seen the introduction of the plastic bag charge, the phasing out of plastic straws and now the growing popularity of oat-based products. Last year we found that younger consumers were choosing to spend more during their grocery shopping on more sustainable options.”At a time when many dairy farmers are struggling to make a living, Mintel said the 16- to 24-year-old group were the most likely to agree with the statement that dairy farming had a negative impact on the environment. The falling usage among this group was a “potential concern for the industry”, Mintel said.The same was true of hot drinks, where only four in 10 added plant milk, compared with double that figure for traditional milk.

Dave Burnley hasn’t missed a game since 1974 – and he’s got no intention of missing either fixtureIt had been discussed at length whether to jump in a car to try to see a half each of Burnley’s friendlies at Crewe and Port Vale on Saturday. But now I’ve decided on a plan of military precision that includes a taxi, a train and a rush at either end on foot.Both matches kick off at 3pm and the two are less than 15 miles apart along the A500 – it’s actually called the A500 derby when Crewe and Vale play each other. The issue was whether I could get in at one of the grounds at half-time, which I looked into, because no one will be manning the turnstiles. So, the thinking was if I can just walk into the ground I would do both.Well, what I’ve actually done is feed Crewe a cock-and-bull, saying I’m a wedding planner who will be at the Crewe register office but can’t get to the ground until just after 4pm. The club have said this is fine so I’m going to the Port Vale game first but will leave at about 3.35pm to catch a taxi that is waiting for me and a friend, Pete. We’ll be in the Hamil End because that’s right by Hamil Road where the taxi will be waiting, and it will take us to Longport train station for the 3.40pm to Crewe, which gets us in at 4.01. From there the ground is close so I think only five minutes of the second half of the second match will be missed.The last Burnley game I missed in any competition was on 10 April 1974: Newcastle United away. It was rescheduled due to the bad weather six times from its original 1 December date and finally squeezed in without my knowledge.Before then it was Ipswich Town away on 11 January 1969. I don’t have a wife, not in my situation – following a football team is like being married – though I do have a daughter, Clarette.It was quite contentious with her mother – there were three names that I proposed.So the third choice was Clarette – Clarette Anne Baloo (Claret and Blue) but she said she wasn’t having a daughter named after a Jungle Book character – Baloo – so it was then Clarette, the very feminine Clarette. I, of course, changed my name to Dave Burnley the day after we got relegated from the top tier in May 1976 – it cost £7.50.This turned out to be prophetic. All the teams had left for the mainland because it was the end of the season so the opponents were a Magaluf Waiters XI. Anyway, my week’s holiday was up so I did a scam where I said I’d lost my passport in a drunken state and had to go to the consular to extend my stay as the game still hadn’t been played. I did this and, eventually, they played the game on the aerodrome where I’d been sleeping before I found a burnt-out hotel to sleep in instead.The goals were just posts – no nets – and I was the only Burnley fan watching. There was about another 50 people – club dignitaries and personnel – and Harry Potts was the manager. I was on the sideline with no top on, just my silk Burnley scarf in the heat, and 20 minutes from time Leighton James came over and said: “Come on, you’re on.” I said: “Don’t be daft.” He said: “No, the gaffer said.” And they called me on and I played as a centre-forward.The places I’ve been to following Burnley include Singapore, America twice, Norway, Spain – of course – three times, Austria three times, Italy three times, etc – some of which are featured in my books, Got to be There! and Still There!Saturday will just be the latest of many friendlies for me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/168384dd6ef680519ed2f61f67ee4b8bfef5ce5b/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20577bfb46676f83e8fac474b4785094","title":"egypt africa cup of nations 2019 patriotism political soft power","story":"When the curtain falls on Egypt’s Africa Cup of Nations on Friday night, the overwhelming sense among many local residents will be one of relief. Senegal and Algeria will contest the final but there is a feeling, at the end of a hastily arranged tournament that ided home supporters and saw their team fall short of expectations, that the past month is best swept under the carpet. The country sought political capital from extending the arm of help to its continent when Cameroon was stripped of hosting rights last year, but the gains have been hard to discern.“Nobody can deny the fact there’s a connection between politics and the organisation of this tournament,” said Ziad Akl, an analyst with the Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies. “The national discourse overshadowing this whole thing is that this is a matter of patriotism, not a matter of football.”The tournament has been a clear opportunity for Egypt: one that allows it to promote its soft power interests within Africa. “This connects to Egypt’s presidency of the African Union, how Egypt is trying to exhibit an image saying that it is the most capable country with sports infrastructure,” said Akl.Egypt also launched a new channel, TimeSport, that has allowed citizens to watch matches for free. The channel excuses them from paying fees to BeInSports, owned by rival nation Qatar. “Having a channel like TimeSport is one of the tools of political soft power that the regime is using right now throughout football,” said Akl.There has been a less open approach around the stadiums. Supporters were required to obtain a “Fan ID” before purchasing a ticket, a step up from already tight measures filtering fans who wanted to watch domestic matches since the stands were reopened last year. Getting a fan ID requires handing over a lot of personal data: all four names each Egyptian has, plus their mother’s name from their birth certificate, details of their jobs, a picture and a photo of their existing ID card.“This is something that logistically has never existed in the history of Egyptian audiences and stadiums,” said Akl. “You’re being evaluated according to your own data – it’s not about the fact you want a Fan ID, it’s about whether you qualify for one. You’d have to be someone who isn’t politicised.”The Fan ID requirement has allowed the Egyptian authorities to sift out anyone they believe might say or do anything political in the stands. Akl believes upper- and middle-class fans, those less likely to use football as an opportunity for political messages, are being targeted to fill stadiums. There have been quiet exceptions: in the 74th minute of every game, fans have held their phones aloft to commemorate the 74 victims of the Port Said tragedy, while similar scenes have occurred to mark the shirt number – 22 – of the exiled former superstar Mohamed Aboutrika. But they are low-key forms of protest that would require heavy-handedness to quash.Some visiting teams have played to largely empty stadiums. Akl said he knows an estimated 250 people who were refused tickets. “There are plenty who have been refused for no apparent reason, with no obvious affiliation, and there are games where it just doesn’t make sense that the tickets would be sold out,” he said. He added that some businesses have bought tickets in bulk since Egypt suffered a surprise exit against South Africa, offsetting a desire among local fans to treat the tournament as over.That has still hurt attendances during the knockout phase, although ticket prices have hardly helped. The cheapest access to the final costs $30, just under a quarter of the average monthly salary semi-final tickets cost a minimum of $18 and it is no surprise that Senegal v Tunisia and Algeria v Nigeria took place to swathes of empty seats. “What disappoints us is that the stadiums are a little empty,” the Senegal coach, Aliou Cissé, said. “Tomorrow we hope that the Egyptians, Algerians and Senegalese will be there to fill the stadium.”There is genuine concern they may not and, for a country eager to demonstrate its sporting fervour, the optics of more gaps in the stands would be terrible. In any case, Algeria’s supporters may have to practise caution. One, named locally as Samir Sardouk, was punished during the group stage for breaching the barrier between football and politics. He is believed to have been deported for holding a placard which translates as “they all must go!”, a slogan of the anti-government uprising that began this year in Algeria. He has since been jailed for a year in his home country.“As soon as they asked me for my passport I knew something was wrong,” one of his friends told the . “They almost kidnapped us from the stadium. After a few kilometres they dropped me and the second supporter off. As soon as we got out of the car, they told us not to cause any problems and drove away with Samir.” Sardouk was taken straight to El Harrach prison in Algeria upon returning, and subsequently sentenced.Egypt’s human rights record is difficult to ignore. As the tournament progressed, Egyptian authorities arrested at least eight leftist political figures in coordinated dawn raids. Friends suggested the group was targeted as they prepared to launch a political party to compete in next year’s parliamentary elections. A week later, Amnesty International released a report describing “unprecedented repression,” under the regime of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.For domestic fans, Afcon was supposed to be a ray of sunshine that never really materialised. In July, Egypt raised fuel prices, an unpopular move that strains a population wearied by years of austerity measures. “The fact we were knocked out was unexpected and didn’t wield the expected outcome for the regime,” Akl said. Afcon was also supposed to bring in vital revenue. “There was an overestimation of financial gains,” said Akl.Now they hope that, with the world’s eyes on what should be a watchable final, a positive last impression brings at least some fond memories before everyone moves on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa4b2c1be4e2aa5073f495f0040ddd4897b423fe/110_0_1580_948/master/1580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52f301e84ecc3feb158d06dabb353a58","title":"apollo women man walk on the moon","story":"Numerous unsung women, from computer engineers and mathematicians to secretaries and seamstresses, helped put a man on the moon. Here are the stories of some of those womenAll 12 people who walked on the moon were men. But among the 400,000 people who made it possible, there were numerous unsung women, from computer engineers and mathematicians to secretaries and seamstresses. Today, as America contemplates a return to the moon, there is resolve to ensure women aren’t in the background, but are instead the astronauts leading the way. Fifty years after Apollo, David Smith tells the stories of some of the women who helped put a man on the moon.A 21-year-old woman from Texas was responsible for making sure that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were prepared and in the right frame of mind to make history on the moon.Jamye Flowers, who had joined Nasa straight out of school, was Apollo 11’s crew secretary, a position that required a troubleshooting all-rounder willing to work long hours.According to the Smithsonian Institution’s Air \u0026amp Space magazine, “Coplin wrote their frequent travel orders, ran interference when outsiders wanted access, traveled with them to the Cape for launches, kept their wives informed, and even babysat their children. When changes were made to the flight checklist, she had enough technical knowledge to see that they were made correctly.”Flowers recalled visiting the launchpad at night when the Saturn V rocket was lit up. “We would try to make a good luck trip to get as close to the pad as we could, and just sit there and soak it all in and say a few little prayers for good flights and everything. That became a ritual for us to do that. I remember being out there that night on 11. It was exciting.”Margaret Hamilton grew up in the midwest and says it was her British father who taught her to ask “what if” and “why not”. She started her career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959 but then got wind that Nasa was aiming for the moon. “The ad made it sound so exciting, I decided to go find out more about it,” she recalled in a recent interview with the .Hamilton became the lead programmer on the groundbreaking Apollo guidance computer, which had less capacity than today’s mobile phones, and worked on every crewed mission (she names Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 as particular favorites). She led the team that developed the inflight software for the command and lunar modules and came up with the idea to call her discipline “software engineering”.She was also a woman in a man’s world. “I didn’t even think about it at the time, but the culture was different,” she said at the headquarters of Draper, a Boston engineering company that received the Apollo program’s first major contract. “When I first got there I was the only one in that project. If you look at photos of the engineers back then, you can hardly find a woman in there.“People say, ‘Well, there were women’. Yeah, but they weren’t doing technical jobs,” she said. Hamilton, who often brought her daughter, Lauren, to work with her in the evenings and on weekends, recalled that as time went on, the women’s liberation movement asserted itself. “There was a whole thing that started, even at MIT, and they wanted only women around to join. I was curious because one of the people worked for me, and so I remember going and they were saying all these horrible things that men did.“Then they wanted me to speak up at this huge conference at MIT, to talk to the women I said, ‘Well, what about the men?’ ‘Oh, we’re not inviting them, this is only for women.’ I said, ‘If it’s only for women I’m not going to be in favour of another kind of discrimination.’ Either everybody’s involved or they’re not, and I didn’t give my talk because I thought it had to do with fairness for all.”Hamilton set up her own software company and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama in 2016. Now 82, she uses email but does not have any social media accounts. She is encouraged by women’s advances in the workplace, and in space, but warns that a backlash is under way.“There are many problems in the culture today that are worse than yesterday because women are more of a threat to some people,” she added. “They weren’t a threat then they were an oddity. Because of social media and everything there’s a lot of good stuff and a lot of bad stuff. If the good stuff wins over then there’s hope. So how do we fight that? How do we make that work?”Future visitors to the moon can look for “Crater Poppy”, named after number cruncher Frances “Poppy” Northcutt.She went to the University of Texas and studied maths because, she once said, it would help her get “a man’s job”. She joined TRW Systems, an aerospace contractor that worked with Nasa on the Apollo program and designed and built the descent engine for the lunar lander.Northcutt was soon promoted, becoming the first female engineer to be part of mission control at Nasa. She worked alongside male colleagues to plan the trajectory for Apollo 8 to return to Earth. She was also involved in Apollo 11 and the epic struggle to bring Apollo 13 home after it got into trouble.“I felt a lot of pressure because I was the only woman,” she told PBS. “I started looking around at these dudes that were working with me and I thought, ‘You know, I’m as smart as they are.’”At one point she discovered one of Nasa’s internal channel cameras was focused entirely on her. She added: “I was sort of the trophy. I was blonde, I was young, I was thin, I wore the ladies’ fashion clothes.”But Northcutt learned to live with the attention. “Well, of course I was being used,” she told PBS. “My feeling was, you can play this both ways. The mere fact that a lot of women found out for the first time that there was a woman in mission control was a very big deal.”After Nasa, Northcutt became an outspoken feminist and, as the first “women’s advocate” in Houston, helped combat sex discrimination in the fire department. She went on to be a criminal defense lawyer and, now 74, is currently the president of the Texas chapter of the National Organization for Women.She endured obscene phone calls, lewd comments in the elevator and having to leave the building where she worked in search of a female bathroom.But on 16 July 1969, JoAnn Morgan was the only woman in the launch firing room for the Apollo 11 liftoff.A self-described “precocious little kid”, Morgan began working for Nasa in 1958 while still in college. The Nasa website recounts: “Morgan heard later from colleagues that when she was hired to join the team, her immediate supervisor, Jim White, called everyone for a meeting – except her. As the room filled with men, White explained to the crew:“‘This is a young lady who wants to be an engineer. You’re to treat her like an engineer. But she’s not your buddy. You call her Ms Hardin. You’re not to be familiar.’“‘Well, can we ask her to make coffee?’ someone asked.“‘No,’ White said. ‘You don’t ask an engineer to make coffee.’”It was therefore little surprise that Morgan usually got the overnight shift ahead of launches, making way for a male colleague a few hours before the grand spectacle.But when it came to the big one, she got her big break as instrumentation controller. Among the familiar rows of white short-sleeved shirts and dark ties, she is the solitary woman visible inside Nasa’s firing room for the launch of Apollo 11.She told the Nasa website: “It was just meant to be for me to be in the launching business. I’ve got rocket fuel in my blood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fcc7525e08d58644c2e35de560caed0e965e403/0_80_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c3ba8a5aa61c66bd88399da9db07d5","title":"cost of global push to prevent women dying in childbirth to increase sixfold","story":"As Trump funding drought continues, UN figures show billions more will be needed to meet global target on maternal mortalityThe cost of preventing women from dying in childbirth is projected to increase sixfold by 2030, requiring billions of dollars to achieve global targets, according to the UN.The estimate was released by the UN population fund (UNFPA) on Thursday, offering a snapshot of the scale of the challenge the agency has set itself to end preventable maternal deaths by 2030.Similarly ambitious is a target established by the UN sustainable development goals to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths for every 100,000 live births.Researchers at UNFPA and Johns Hopkins University calculated that the annual cost of direct services, such as paying for medical staff, drugs and supplies when a woman is giving birth, will reach $7.8bn (£6.2bn) by 2030, up from an estimated $1.4bn last year.Donor aid for maternal healthcare fell between 2013 and 2017, from $4.4bn $3.9bn.The projected figure, which takes into account rising population as well as the cost of current interventions and scaling up services, is based on requirements in the countries with the highest number of maternal deaths. It does not include the logistics of getting women to health centres, the barriers they face to access services, or other associated costs.The most recent figures provided by the World Health Organization, which date back to 2015, showed the global maternal mortality ratio to be 216 deaths for every 100,000 live births. The number increased to 436 in the world’s least developed countries. The WHO is expected to update the figures later this year.The UNFPA said the projections, presented in New York, should be a wake-up call for governments. The agency hopes the updated estimate will drive more funding from donors and the private sector.“We want to show the facts to stakeholders that this is the situation,” said Tharanga Godallage, monitoring and data specialist at the UNFPA.The agency also projected that the annual cost of meeting the growing need for modern forms of contraception would almost double, from $2.3bn in 2018 to $4.5bn by 2030.The UNFPA, working with Johns Hopkins, Victoria University, the University of Washington and global health organisation Avenir Health, will present more detailed cost projections on maternal health, family planning, ending female genital mutilation and child marriage at a November summit in Kenya to mark the 25th anniversary of the landmark international conference on population and development held in Cairo. Projections for inidual countries will also be produced to encourage governments to increase their health budgets.In 1994, 179 leaders adopted a programme of action that emphasised the centrality of women’s empowerment in tackling population growth and development, as opposed to focusing simply on family planning. More than 200 recommendations were agreed, covering issues such as access to decent reproductive health services, sexual health advice and support, and the elimination of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and forced marriage.The summit in Nairobi will assess the gaps in provision and, the UNFPA hopes, garner political and financial commitments to implement the programme of action and meet the sustainable development goals.The conference comes amid a considerable global backlash against women’s rights, and reproductive rights in particular.Speaking to the  last month, Natalia Kanem, the UNFPA’s executive director, said women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights needed to be “elevated to front and centre” to achieve the SDGs.Last Friday, the US government confirmed that, for a third consecutive year, it would not fund the UNFPA under provisions in the Kemp-Karsten amendment. The amendment prohibits foreign aid to any organisation deemed by the US administration to be involved in coercive abortion or forced sterilisation. In a statement on Monday, the UNFPA strongly denied it supported either.The statement said: “UNFPA does not perform, promote or fund abortion, and we accord the highest priority to universal access to voluntary family planning, which helps prevent abortions from occurring.“UNFPA opposes coercive practices, such as forced sterilisation and coerced abortions, and has spoken out against instances of such human rights abuses.”The statement added that the administration had yet to produce evidence to justify the “serious claims made against its work”, and reiterated an invitation for US officials to visit its offices in China.Enacted in 1985, the Kemp-Karsten amendment has been used by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W Bush to stop funding the agency. Funding was resumed under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.The Trump administration used the amendment to defund the agency in April 2017 as one of a number of global policies introduced to restrict global funding for reproductive healthcare.In 2016, the US contributed $69m to the UNFPA to help cover the agency’s core costs and provide short-term support for projects in humanitarian settings. In 2015, the US was the agency’s third largest bilateral donor, contributing $75m to its operations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd6abc2b73004e6d4ecc9e3ca7db84986578cc2/0_1697_4317_2590/master/4317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df648def69381154abc7131e01ec0ec6","title":"experience my dog is a champion surfer","story":"The dogs have 10 minutes to catch as many waves as they can. Judges look at length of ride, whether they make it back to shore, and how many tricks they doWhen my golden retriever, Ricochet, was born, on 20 January 2008, she took her first breath in my hands. I had launched a non-profit organisation called Puppy Prodigies, to train service dogs for people with disabilities, and I supported her mother while she had her litter. Ricochet was the ninth of 10.She was a brilliant puppy – high energy and lots of fun she got her name because she was literally bouncing off the walls. She began service dog training at a few days old and started off well, but at 16 weeks she began to shut down she was more interested in chasing birds. Luckily she found something else to do.We live in San Diego, California, half an hour from the ocean. I never planned to raise a surf dog, but she had been in a kids’ pool at eight weeks old and showed great balance on a boogie board. We progressed to a bigger pool, then the bay, then the ocean.I got her a 6ft foam board and a pink lifejacket. I don’t surf so, as she improved, she got a water handler. Surf dog contests were becoming popular in southern California and someone suggested she take part in one, at Ocean Beach in San Diego. Ricochet was placed third of about 15 dogs. I felt so proud – not because she had a medal but because she had shown what she was capable of.Typically in contests, the dogs have 10 minutes to catch as many waves as they can. Judges look at the length of the ride, whether they make it back to shore, and how many tricks or turns they do, such as riding a wave backwards. A big wave scores higher in the judging stakes. Breeds with shorter legs, such as bulldogs or corgis, tend to do well because they have lower centres of gravity, but all sorts of dogs have won. It all comes down to balance. There’s always a crowd of spectators on the beach. On the board, she looks pretty serious and focused. Dogs wag their tails on the sand, but not so much on the water, where they need them for balance. She’s 11 years old now and has taken part in about 20 contests. She has nine gold medals and has been placed second or third in most of the others.Soon after she started surfing, Ricochet started doing something more meaningful with her talent. She began to accompany children with disabilities for surf therapy, and we have used her profile to fundraise for them, working first with Patrick, a 14-year-old quadriplegic boy. Patrick enjoyed the independence and Ricochet was joyful when they shared a board.In 2009, a video of Patrick and Ricochet went viral. It’s had more than 6.5m views. She now has 230,000 Facebook followers and 100,000 on Instagram. We get messages every week from people wanting to work with or meet her. One teenage boy with a brain tumour asked to surf with her for his Make A Wish. She’s now raised more than $500,000 for humans and animals in need.She is a certified therapy dog, and also works with service members and veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She connects with people on an extremely deep level and helps them express their feelings. Recently, she placed herself up against a wall to demonstrate how a naval officer she was working with was struggling inside. There is something about her that makes her excel.Ricochet is one of only three competitive surf dogs from the original circuit still alive, but she doesn’t compete any more. Her last contest was at Imperial Beach in 2014, and she won first place. These days, competitions happen all over the world and up to 100 dogs compete for medals and bragging rights. Some dogs are sponsored, but there’s usually a charity element.She’s in the last quarter of her life now and doesn’t have the energy for long rides on the board but she still surfs for fun and does surf therapy work. Judges think it’s her ability to ride a wave that qualifies her as a winner. But, to me, it is her healing power that makes Ricochet a champion.• As told to Deborah LintonDo you have an experience to share?

Here’s a quick guide to the key relationshipsEveryone in the UK is a friendless loser. Not my words, but those (slightly paraphrased) of a recent Snapchat survey that found British people have fewer close mates than other nationalities. With 2.6 “best friends” on average, compared with the frankly excessive 6.6 boasted by participants in Saudi Arabia, and one in seven of us reporting no best friends at all, the results paint a damning portrait of a seemingly lonely populace. A nation of Briton-no-mates.Mind you, new research by MIT reckons humans can only cope with a maximum of five close friends, so we wouldn’t know what to do with more even if we had them. These findings corroborate 1990s research by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who suggested a correlation between brain size and social relationships. In other words: humans are only capable of having a finite number of people in our social sphere at any given time, because we’re all a bunch of numpties. Now, I’m no scientist, but based on how dramatically my stress levels spike whenever I receive more than one text message before 11am, I’d say that checks out.Despite being a significant cornerstone of a healthy social life, friends can be strangely transitory. From our first encounters in infant school, when we bond over crayons and crisps, to agonising encounters in our 20s, when we bond over sexual attraction and hating the same people on Twitter, the makeup of our social circles will change in accordance with how we – hopefully – evolve as iniduals.That first core group becomes a rotating cast. Some may remain as key protagonists, others are recurring characters, and there will inevitably be many, many regrettable cameos. But in these fraught, isolationist times, let us take a moment to consider our mates. Who are they and what can they tell us about ourselves?Our first comrade of convenience, the School Friend enters our life before we’ve had time to develop a personality. This is especially cruel because these are also our most formative years, so everyone remembers everything. Think of all the names you still know in full, the faces you remember, the houses you can still picture, the girl you were briefly close with in year 5 because you got put in maths together and spent the entire class trying to see how many dicks you could draw on a rubber – and then basically never spoke to again. Mad, really, how GCSE results day isn’t also accompanied by a gracious ceremony in which everyone has their memory erased, Men In Black-style. Seems like an oversight.Once you do start to find yourself, these early connections go one of three ways: you drift apart in secondary school and never hear about them again until your mum bumps into their mum in Sainsbury’s you stay friends long enough to have each other on Facebook, where you occasionally like photos of their baby or you stay friends for ever, know them best of anyone in the world, and are ultimately tasked with delivering a thoughtful but humorous eulogy at their funeral, during which you break the tension by calling them an “old git” for dying first.You see them the most, talk to them the most and have the most in-jokes with them because you spend eight hours a day, five days a week together in the same shipping container office spaceon Slackbehind a bar. But, at the same time, they know the least about you. You have a shared language, a veritable buffet of niche references, but they couldn’t tell you how many siblings you have, or how old you are. In fact, if it weren’t for the office email, would they even know your last name?You will have lunch together twice a week for three years until one of you resigns, and then you will never see them again until you bump into them at Latitude, where you have precisely one beer and realise the only thing you had in common was complaining about the work toilets.An extremely shallow, but incredibly pivotal, relationship, the Sesh Friend is the person who, regardless of time or place, can always be relied on to respond to your Bat-Signal text: “’Spoons?”These are people you don’t know on any real level, but still share a wealth of emotional experiences with, always ending up on the same tired sofa at afterparties, watching old Talking Heads performances on YouTube while they describe a podcast they once listened to about doppelgängers. Never underestimate the bonding agent that is cracking open the last Tyskie to share as the sky turns cold.Beyond these semi-deep 5am experiences, you have no involvement with them whatsoever. You have never once met for coffee, would never dream of lending each other money, and the only chats you have outside of the sesh are regarding where to meet for the sesh.The Internet Friend is basically the inverse of Sesh Friend they know everything about you except what you’re actually like. They’re clued up on the tedious minutiae of your life – what aesthetic you’re feeling at the moment, what mood you were in at 6.19pm last Tuesday, how you couldn’t have a burrito for lunch because the place around the corner from your office was closed for some reason. You exchange playlists, long emails, constant DMs perhaps you even send each other gifts in the post. But they have no idea about your physical presence, your tics and mannerisms, the geometry of your face cracking into a smile at that gif of a puppy jumping into a bush.Nevertheless, the Internet Friend holds an enormous amount of weight. The distance means you often tell them things you might find difficult to say IRL, especially if you spend a lot of time online because you’re struggling in your social life. Whether you met them on Tumblr, in a forum for people with a specific medical condition, or through a zealous appreciation of each other’s crap tweets, the Internet Friend can be a guiding light, offering support from the other side of the world. At certain points, you might even call them your closest friend.Until you meet them, that is. Never do that.University is a microcycle of your entire life in friendships. You spend the first year talking to everyone, throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks. By the second year, you might have two or three different socials circles that overlap, Venn diagram-like, containing people you like to varying degrees.By the third year, you can’t be arsed. By now, there are about four people on the entire campus you get on with, and you’re too tired to keep putting in work with the rest. The likelihood of those four people genuinely enjoying each other’s company is even slimmer, so you spend the last 12 months of your degree either enjoying one-on-one hangouts, or going out in massive groups of people whose names you’ll struggle to remember when tagging your graduation photos.Too many of us feel compelled to stick around people we don’t like simply because they’ve been there for ages, or we did, at one point, consider them a friend – but frankly, life’s too short for that. If you’re fundamentally at odds with someone, stop forcing those awkward monthly catch-ups at Costa, the ones that end with a Kardashian-style barny because you said something uncomplimentary about their new squeeze, and cut them out. Who has the time?Equally, though – is there any greater driving force for success than hatred? Do the achievements of a frenemy not spur you to greater heights? Do your own achievements not then feel even sweeter? Ultimately, a frenemy’s value is dependent on how you fare on bitterness and competition. If the answer is “I thrive”, then these might be the greatest relationships of your life. Why do you think Fleetwood Mac were so successful?Twitter user @queentrashcan recently defined the background friend in a viral post, which read: “i don’t fit in with any particular group of friends. they all are closer with each other and i sometimes link on but am permanent with no one. i think about all these people constantly but i don’t think i cross their minds often.”Basically the concept is: a lone wolf who has no established friendship group. This is someone you always say hello to on a night out, ask who they’re with, then realise it’s you. While you have nothing but good things to say about this person, you rarely invite them anywhere because someone else always seems to. Everyone assumes the background friend is better friends with someone else, while the background friend themselves is elusive familiar to many groups, but a key player in none. Big Donnie Darko energy.Honestly, though, I’m not convinced this is a real thing. People are emotionally stunted and rarely vocalise what other people mean to them, so I would argue that the background friend is a state of mind more often than it is an identity. Then again, who among us has not had a quiet moment in the toilet at a house party, thousand-yard staring into the cabinet mirror, worrying that, if you died tomorrow, there might be no one who knows your favourite song is Californication.There are some notable downsides to being a new parent: the temporary dip in sexual activity, sleep deprivation, having to raise a healthy, happy baby in the context of humanity’s uncertain future on our rapidly dying planet. But the worst has to be taking your kid to playgroup and having to talk to other parents. And so, for a time, you will spend several hours a week listening to Karen talk about getting reiki for her swollen feet, and you will smile politely, and say, “Oh, that’s interesting” even if it isn’t, because she’s the only adult company you’ve had all week.These are the ultimate in circumstantial friends – like partners of friends, or the relatives of long-term partners, whom you must accept as your own, despite having nothing in common.Best friends comprise the most fulfilling, longstanding and volatile relationships of your life. These are the legends who will support you unequivocally when you’re going through a rough time, but will also tell you when you’re behaving like an arsehole or have food in your teeth. Of course, the closer you are, the deeper the arguments – but, ultimately, these are the smug bastards who know you better than you know yourself. A best friend will listen to your worst thoughts and not judge. A best friend will rib you when you need humbling, and cook for you when you’re down in the dumps. Most importantly though, a best friend will let you post a photo on Instagram in which you look great but they look truly awful, because they know you’re trying to pull someone.

BritBox is being pitched as a cheaper additional streaming service for consumers who already subscribe to Netflix, with a focus on providing thousands of hours of archive material and classic boxsets from the two broadcasters.Headline launch programmes on the service are the ITV reality show Love Island, the BBC sitcom Famalam and the dramas Cleaning Up and Gentleman Jack. There will also be archive drama and comedy including Gavin \u0026amp Stacey, Victoria, Happy Valley, Broadchurch, Les Miserables, The Office and Benidorm.Although there will be a “broad range” of programmes made exclusively for BritBox, the service will have a limited budget and no standalone shows have yet been commissioned.The plan for the future is to create a conveyor belt of new content going from the BBC and ITV to BritBox. Programmes will first be shown on traditional live television channels, then made available for free on existing catch-up services, then transferred across to BritBox.BBC content will be available on iPlayer for up to a year before making the jump to Britbox, while ITV material will move behind a paywall after 30 days on ITV Hub. Not all programmes will transfer across, as BritBox will have to agree licensing deals with independent producers.Other broadcasters could ultimately get involved. Channel 4 said it continued to be in “constructive discussions” about adding its archive material to BritBox at a later date, while Channel 5 could also join.The collaboration between the BBC and ITV has been long-awaited. In 2008, all of the UK’s major broadcasters planned to pool their content and create a pioneering project under the name Project Kangaroo, which would have been one of the most advanced streaming services in the world.However, the competition commission blocked the plan, arguing it could make the existing broadcasters too dominant in the online video market. The decision is seen within the British television industry as the original sin that allowed US companies such as Netflix to dominate the streaming market, leaving UK companies playing catch-up.ITV, whose share price has fallen in recent months as it dealt with the fallout from the cancellation of The Jeremy Kyle Show following the death of a guest, has said it intends to invest about £65m in BritBox during its first two years. Netflix’s global content budget alone is about $15bn a year, fuelled by substantial borrowing, although it recently missed subscriber growth targets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbf1c32f9bb146201efd336699a75942b97a8c92/0_233_5106_3063/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afed180ed66cbcdb051ef4727a9fbcc6","title":"disco demolition the night they tried to crush black music","story":"When a DJ called on listeners to destroy disco records in a Chicago stadium, things turned nasty – and 40 years on, the ugly attitudes behind the event ring out loud and clearIn the summer of 1979, Vince Lawrence had got himself a part-time job as an usher at Comiskey Park baseball stadium, home to the Chicago White Sox. It wasn’t an ideal job for a black teenager. Comiskey Park was next door to Bridgeport, a neighbourhood of the city where, as Lawrence puts it, “it was common knowledge that you might not want to be hanging around after dark, because there were people there who for sure don’t like you based on your colour”. The area was so notorious for racism that even one of the White Sox’s star players, Thad Bosley, had found his car surrounded by a mob after taking a wrong turning driving home after a game, the situation only diffused when one of them recognised him.Still, Lawrence’s job had perks. Punters rich enough to sit in the stadium’s boxes would tip well, you could get a good view of the game and there were regular special promotional events, often with music: country nights, Elvis nights. Tonight, he was looking forward to seeing a band called Teenage Radiation, fronted by loudmouth local radio DJ Steve Dahl: they had recorded a parody single called Do Ya Think I’m Disco, part of Dahl’s ongoing campaign against the commercially dominant genre in late 70s America. Embittered by the fact that he had been fired by a station called WDAI when it switched formats from AOR to disco, Dahl had been endlessly mouthing off on air at his new station, WLUP, also known as The Loop: snapping disco records or dragging the needle across them, encouraging people to join his anti-disco organisation, the Insane Coho Lips. He had worked out a promotion with the White Sox: turn up at Comiskey Park on 12 July with a disco record and you would get in for 98¢. Dahl planned to fill a dumpster with the records and blow them up as a publicity stunt.Lawrence realised something wasn’t right: people weren’t just turning up with disco records, but anything made by a black artist. “I said to my boss: ‘Hey, a lot of these records they’re bringing in aren’t disco – they’re R\u0026ampB, they’re funk. Should I make them go home and get a real disco record?’ He said no: if they brought a record, take it, they get a ticket.” He laughs. “I want to say maybe the person bringing the record just made a mistake. But given the amount of mistakes I witnessed, why weren’t there any Air Supply or Cheap Trick records in the bins? No Carpenters records – they weren’t rock’n’roll, right? It was just disco records and black records in the dumpster.”Things turned uglier after Dahl’s demolition took place and the crowd – estimated at 50,000 – rushed the field. Unable to cope with the surge of people the ushers were told to go home and that the police would have to deal with what was degenerating into a riot. “Someone walked up to me said: ‘Hey you – disco sucks!’ and snapped a 12in in half in my face,” Lawrence says. “That’s when I started feeling like: ‘OK, they’re just targeting me because I’m black.’ I’ve got a Loop T-shirt on – what’s the difference between me and the next usher trying to get back to his locker? I was one of the few African American people in the stadium. Steve Dahl said it wasn’t discriminatory, he was an equal opportunities offender or whatever, but Steve didn’t invite no brothers to Comiskey Park.”Forty years on, Disco Demolition Night remains one of the most controversial events in pop history. Last month, when the White Sox commemorated its anniversary, it attracted widespread criticism from Billboard to Vice and the Economist, of a kind that was absent in 1979. Then, only Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone suggested that there was something distinctly ugly about the vast crowd of white men publicly destroying music predominantly made by black artists, dominated by female stars and with a core audience that was, at least initially, largely gay. “White males, 18 to 34, are the most likely to see disco as the product of homosexuals, blacks and Latins, and … to respond to appeals to wipe out such threats to their security.”To understand Disco Demolition Night, you have to understand how commercially dominant disco had become in the US at the time. Of the 16 singles that made the top of the US chart in the first half of 1979, only three were not disco tracks. The previous year, disco singles had been No 1 for 37 weeks out of 52. “In any big city in America, you could turn the radio dial and catch disco on as many as five or more stations,” says Alice Echols, cultural historian, academic and author of Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture. “It had pushed AOR not to the margins precisely, but classic rock didn’t have the dominance on radio that it once had. Live music venues were increasingly switching over to disco.”This didn’t please everyone. “Even though record labels were making a lot of money off disco, they were holding their nose,” she says. “They were worried about it crashing, but they wanted it to crash so they could go back to classic rock. There was also a grassroots anti-disco movement, a national effort on the part of people involved with AOR. There were people who thought it threatened their livelihoods, because of its gobbling up of live venues there were people who just thought it sounded plastic and synthetic and commercial there were people who were just nakedly racist and homophobic.”Nichols says that disco’s dominance was, for some of the haters, inseparable from issues such as busing and affirmative action, initiatives designed to reduce racial segregation in US schools and colleges. Fear of disco, she says, was partly “the fear that American identity was no longer synonymous with whiteness. DJs in Detroit formed a disco vigilante group called the Disco Dux Klan. Originally, their efforts were going to involve wearing white sheets and robes – they got rid of that part of it. And then there were people like Steve Dahl, for whom disco represented a sort of emasculation: you couldn’t wear a scruffy T-shirt and jeans, you had to get dressed up and, worst of all, your girlfriend or wife expected you to humiliate yourself by fucking dancing. Some of the push back against disco also had to do with feminism.”Whatever the reasons behind it, Disco Demolition Night had a startling and immediate impact. Radio stations that had switched to disco switched back to rock. The Grammy awards cancelled their best-disco-recording category after only one year. Chic, who as Echols points out, “had made millions of dollars for Atlantic Records since 1977” – Le Freak was the biggest-selling single in the label’s history – found “suddenly no one at the label would take their calls”. Even disco labels were changing the designs of 12in-single sleeves to make their products look less like disco records. In the second half of 1979, only one disco single – Michael Jackson’s Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough – made US No 1, for a solitary week.“I didn’t take it seriously at all, which obviously was a mistake in retrospect,” says Vince Aletti, who in 1979 had just quit his column in Record World – which had assiduously documented disco’s rise – in order to work at Warner Bros’ disco label, RFC. “The higher-ups at the label did. There were a lot of rock’n’roll stalwarts in the music industry who were not just unhappy but angry and felt that rock’n’roll was being ignored because black pop was dominating the charts. Within a short period of time, Warner Bros decided there was no longer a disco department. We became the dance music department – disco was a dirty word. Virtually every record label did the same thing.”In some senses, the after-effects of Disco Demolition went on for years. As Echols notes, the Rolling Stones had frequently toured with black artists, including Stevie Wonder and Ike and Tina Turner, who were warmly received by their audience, but when Prince supported them in 1981, he was booed offstage.In others, it proved an entirely pyrrhic victory. Retreating underground to its original audience, disco became arguably more adventurous and creative than ever: the immediate post-Disco Demolition years were the era of Arthur Russell’s extraordinary avant-disco (Loose Joints’ Is It All Over My Face? and Dinosaur L’s Go Bang) of the electronic experimentation and eclecticism of the sound pioneers by DJ Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York of the ferocious, explicitly queer hi-NRG sound pioneered in San Francisco by Patrick Cowley.Ironically, the most revolutionary development took place in Chicago, the city where disco had supposedly been killed: inspired in equal part by the raw disco edits of DJ Frankie Knuckles and European electronic music by Fad Gadget and Kraftwerk, former Comiskey Park usher Vince Lawrence and Jesse Saunders co-wrote the first house single, On and On, in 1984. Lawrence went on to co-write Farley “Jackmaster” Funk’s Love Can’t Turn Around, the first house single to achieve mainstream success in the UK. Meanwhile, the two biggest stars of the 1980s – Michael Jackson and Madonna – were disco acts in all but name.“I don’t think anybody at the disco level was thrown into deep despair,” says Aletti. “They had to adjust to how the record companies now worked, but it just meant that there was a lot of really interesting music still coming out that was danceable, which is kind of where disco started – a lot of oddball danceable records that didn’t need to be called anything.” Still, the 40th anniversary commemoration of Disco Demolition left a peculiar taste. “It baffles me,” says Lawrence. “We live in a different world – Dahl’s either incredibly naive or dishonest.”Commemorating Disco Demolition Night in the US political climate of 2019 makes a strange kind of sense, though. There’s a weird correlation between the way Dahl has defended Disco Demolition – standing up for the “rock’n’roll lifestyle” of straight white men in the face of disco’s dominance – and the language of the alt-right, where Milo Yiannopoulos claims that those taking part in a “straight pride” parade represent “America’s most brutally repressed identity”. “It’s fascinating that this has happened now,” agrees Echols. “It does sound very much in line with politics over here. It’s very … Trumpist.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

In New York City some apartments have their rents capped by a board.Khan said Scotland had recently introduced laws allowing councils to apply “rent pressure zones” where rents could rise by no more than inflation, but the rest of England and Wales had very weak protections.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,” Khan said. “Unlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The report, authored by the Labour MP Karen Buck and the deputy mayor, James Murray, draws on proposals from a study by the New Economics Foundation (NEF).Miatta Fahnbulleh, NEF’s chief executive, said urgent and radical action was needed. She said: “Since 2010 average rents have risen three times as fast as average incomes. The scale of this affordability crisis means that action must be taken. We support the mayor’s call – drawn from NEF’s proposals – for additional powers to design and roll out rent controls. With a majority of Londoners now in favour of rent control, we urge the government to grant the powers needed to the mayor to bring rents down to affordable levels for London’s 2.4 million private renters.”Dan Wilson Craw, the director of the housing campaign group Generation Rent, said the current state of the rental market meant a rented property could rarely be a true home. “Londoners are being priced out of the neighbourhoods they grew up in, couples are delaying having kids and many tenants dare not complain about disrepair in case their landlord retaliates with a rent hike,” he said. “Sadiq Khan recognises the ambition and urgency needed to improve life for private renters. We hope the new prime minister recognises this too and acts quickly.”Labour’s 2017 manifesto included a pledge to “introduce controls on rent rises” and to consider giving the mayor of London additional powers, given the particular pressures in the capital.The Tory mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey launched his own pledge on housing, proposing establishing a “taxpayer-owned housebuilder” controlled by City Hall that would operate like a private sector firm.Bailey claimed this would result in more affordable homes being built overall, saying the target “acts as a bar” to housebuilding and was rarely being met.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said Khan’s proposal was “a wilfully misleading interpretation of the facts” and said the government had taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants” including plans to abolish “no-fault” evictions and ending letting fees.“Together, these measures will create a housing market that truly works for everyone – in direct contrast to rent controls which could drive responsible landlords out, could reduce investment in high quality housing and ultimately push rents up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2ecd31ff8e8ecf18105f5e4f7019387ad48b2a/0_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50d6265f3ef7463e0ef65cf65e77561","title":"treasury to unveil 2bn public sector pay rise but from existing budgets","story":"Teachers and police among those to reportedly benefit but no new funds availableTwo million public sector workers including police officers and teachers are to receive above-inflation pay increases, the biggest for six years, the government is expected to announce.The Treasury is expected to emphasise that, with the exception of some extra funding for schools, the rises will have to come from existing budgets at an estimated cost of £2bn. It is one of Theresa May’s final decisions as prime minister.The rises do not apply to other public sector staff, such as more junior civil servants and nurses, whose pay is dealt with separately.Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said the proposals were similar to pay rises implemented last year.It comes after a report warned that London and the southern regions of England are facing a shortage of teachers, nurses and police officers as rising rents make housing in large parts of the UK unaffordable for key public sector workers.The study by the consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers published earlier this month said there was an urgent need to increase the supply of homes. It found that the failure of public sector pay to keep pace with soaring housing costs had made it increasingly hard for workers on modest incomes to make ends meet.In London, workers in their 20s were spending more than half their incomes on rent, making it impossible for them to save up the deposit to buy a home.Responding to the Times story, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, called for any pay rise to match overall wage growth and to be funded by new money, not from existing Whitehall departmental budgets.“Labour will invest in our public services across the board, ending years of austerity and eliminating in-work poverty.”Under the Treasury’s proposals, police officers at all levels will receive a salary increase from September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee30fc61086b44400ea73b0ccd51f29fa320f80/0_340_6711_4031/master/6711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39316d93fd0021a8b1bdb8ff0edc08d8","title":"politics live friday readers edition friday 19 july","story":"A forum where readers can discuss today’s politics and share links to breaking news and to the most interesting politics stories, blogs and tweets on the web We’re not writing our usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

When humans came out of their caves, they were going beyond. And this was another dimension of going beyond, to another body in our universe.”The fate of Armstrong’s footprints on the moon, not to mention three lunar rovers and more than 100 other items including a family photograph, a golden olive branch, a “defecation collection device” and, of course, some golf balls, is unknown. And now, as space agencies and private companies gear up for unprecedented operations on the moon, they seem more vulnerable than ever.It is not only Tranquility base that Wörner wants protected. The Soviets landed the first rover on the moon in November 1970. The defunct Lunokhod 1, last heard from in September 1971, is among more than a dozen pieces of Soviet hardware stranded on the moon. “Apollo 11 and Lunokhod would be the two sites I would save. These were both a climax, a culmination of all that was done until then,” Wörner said.But protecting lunar heritage may not be straightforward. On Earth, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) decides what deserves world heritage status from nominations sent by countries that claim ownership of the sites. Different rules apply in space. The UN’s outer space treaty, a keystone of space law, states that all countries are free to explore and use space, but warns it “is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty”. In other words, space is for all and owned by none.Wörner is not put off and sees no need for troublesome regulations. “My hope is that humanity is smart enough not to go back to this type of earthly protection. Just protect it. That’s enough. Just protect it and have everybody agree,” he said. A no-go zone of 50 metres around Tranquility base should do the job, he added.Martin Rees, the Cambridge cosmologist and astronomer royal, said there was a case for designating the sites so future generations and explorers were aware of their importance. “If there are any artefacts there, they shouldn’t be purloined,” he said. “Probably orbiting spacecraft will provide routine CCTV-style coverage which would prevent this from being done clandestinely.”Beyond the dust-covered hardware that stands motionless on the moon, Lord Rees suspects future activity could drive calls for broader lunar protection. The Apollo 17 astronaut and geologist Harrison Schmidt has advocated strip mining the moon for helium-3, a potential source of energy.The proposal, which Rees suggests has raised eyebrows in the community, could potentially provoke a backlash. “There might be pressure to preserve the more attractive moonscapes against such despoilation, and to try to enforce regulations as in the Antarctic,” he said.Fifty years on from Apollo 11, the moon is still a place to make statements. In January, the Chinese space agency became the first to land a probe on the far side. On Monday, India hopes to launch a robotic probe, the delayed Chandrayaan-2 lander that is bound for the unchartered lunar south pole.Far more is on the cards. Major space agencies, including ESA and Nasa, plan a “lunar gateway”, described by Wörner as a “bus stop to the moon and beyond”. His vision is for a “moon village”, but rather than a sprawl of domes, shops and a cosy pub, it is more an agreement between nations and industry to cooperate on lunar projects.The private sector is eager to be involved. Between now and 2024, at least five companies aim to launch lunar landers. In May, Nasa selected three companies to design, build and operate spacecraft that will ferry scientific experiments and technology packages to the moon.The coming flurry of activity may make protection more urgent. Michelle Hanlon, a space lawyer at the University of Mississippi, co-founded the non-profit organisation For all Moonkind to protect, preserve and memorialise human heritage on the moon. While she conceded that not all of the sites that bear evidence of human activity needed protection, she said many held invaluable scientific and archaeological data that we could not afford to lose. “These sites need to be protected from disruption if only for that reason,” she added.The protection should be far wider, and more formal, than Wörner calls for, Hanlon argues. “It is astounding to me that we wouldn’t protect the site of Luna 2, the very first object humans crashed on to another celestial body, and Luna 9, the very first object humans soft-landed on another celestial body,” she said. The Soviet Luna programme sent robotic craft to the moon between 1959 and 1976.“The director general has a much more optimistic view of human nature than I do,” Hanlon said. “I completely agree that the entities and nations headed back to the moon in the near future will take a commonsense approach and give due regard to the sites and artefacts. However, that is the near future. We have to be prepared for the company or nation that doesn’t care. Or worse, that seeks to return to the moon primarily to pillage for artefacts that will undoubtedly sell for tremendous amounts of money here on Earth.”But Wörner believes heritage can go too far. “I would say let’s limit it to the important ones,” he said. “If you define each and everything on Earth as heritage, you cannot move and it will be the same on the moon. We should not make heritage the brake for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ae057feeb773c534096e30133e6f35b7adc7ee6/0_193_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b17ad162df6c1113cc903fc81d9725","title":"mystery surrounds rohan denniss shock withdrawal from tour de france","story":"World time-trial champion Rohan Dennis has wished his teammates well for the rest of the Tour de France but offered no insight as to why he quit the race dramatically, a day before a stage the Australian was fancied to win.The time-trial specialist stopped at a feed zone 80km into Thursday’s 12th stage when it was announced that he would be withdrawing from the race. He disappeared for several hours, prompting his team, Bahrain-Merida, to issue a statement on Twitter raising concerns over the 29-year-old’s “welfare”.He later turned up at the Bahrain-Merida bus at the finish line but left the bus with his agent and a team media officer, refusing to talk to the waiting media.The team later said the rider made the decision “reluctantly” but offered no further clarity as to why he pulled out. Nor did Dennis when he eventually issued a statement and said he was “very disappointed” to leave the race at this point, but stopped short of giving an explanation.“Obviously the inidual time trial tomorrow had been a big goal for me and the team, but given my current feeling it was the right decision to withdraw earlier today,” Dennis said.“I wish my teammates the very best for the remainder of the race and would like to thank all the Tour de France fans who cheered for me, at home and on the roadside, since Brussels. I will hopefully be back competing in this great race again over the coming seasons.”Amid the initial confusion, Bahrain-Merida sports director Gorazd Stangelj had said he was “confused” and “disappointed” that Dennis, who won the Tour of Switzerland time trial last month, had quit.“We actually expected a big effort from him tomorrow,” Stangelj said. “It was his decision today to stop in the feed zone. We tried to speak with him. He said, ‘I don’t want to talk’ and just abandoned the race.“His condition is not bad, he’s good enough to perform at the Tour de France. For sure it has nothing to do with his condition.”Dennis was fancied to be in contention to take out Friday’s inidual time-trial stage in Pau and his exit will be a boon for defending Tour champion Geraint Thomas, who is also expected to be in the mix on Friday.Dennis has just one year remaining on his contract with Bahrain-Merida and there has been some speculation he is growing impatient with playing second fiddle to former Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali.But when asked whether Dennis was difficult to work with, Stangelj said: “I didn’t have any problem with him this season.The Bahrain-Merida team have been the subject of some controversy this year in the aftermath of the Operation Aderlass doping investigation, which is ongoing and had connected Milan Erzen, of the team’s management, to the investigation. Erzen has forcefully insisted that any allegations against him are false and unfounded.Asked after Thursday’s stage if there were any other issues that may have led to Dennis’s sudden withdrawal, Stangelj said: “Come on, don’t put words in my mouth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f787850f08984b3eea7c2282e12abe8090da1d4/0_111_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65df85ce05cb942fd3a0fa19fbeaf30b","title":"cricket england australia womens ashes test day two live","story":"125th over: Australia 322-4 (Haynes 79, Mooney 0) Perry was trying to get on with things, having just thumped Marsh through midwicket for four the ball before being caught. Beth Mooney next in.Finally, her vigil ends! 329 Test runs between dismissals, ning 2017 to the present day, and 116 runs in this match. She was trying to force the pace and fell that way, mistiming a full toss for the first time this innings, hitting it low to Knight at short midwicket. In truth Perry timed it as she did all day yesterday, but she just didn’t adjust her shot for the closer catcher. 124th over: Australia 315-3 (Perry 112, Haynes 79) Three more singles from Gordon.123rd over: Australia 315-3 (Perry 110, Haynes 78) Now Perry wants to go! Hangs back to Marsh, once, twice, thrice. Then as Marsh goes a bit fuller, Perry dances down the wicket to turn it into a half volley, and lifts it gloriously for four! One bounce down the ground, good strike. Takes a single last ball.122nd over: Australia 310-3 (Perry 105, Haynes 78) Perry advances to Gordon, but can’t beat midwicket. Then taps to midwicket and takes off for a quick single. Would have been run out! Sciver’s throw missed, and Perry gets away with it.Now we have a someone named Gordon bowling to someone named Haynes. Whose nickname is Desmond. Lovely. This is the best cricket name pairing since I met the ICC broadcast manager: Lara Richards.121st over: Australia 309-3 (Perry 104, Haynes 78) Laura Marsh in a double change with her off-spin. A couple of singles the only score. What is Australia’s game here? What’s the point? There’s a real lack of anything out there.120th over: Australia 307-3 (Perry 103, Haynes 77) Kirstie Gordon on to bowl. Heather Knight hasn’t exactly swung the changes at any stage in this innings, despite the Australians enduring everything sent down. Knight hasn’t bowled her off-breaks at all, for instance. Gordon drops short but Perry can’t punish the wide ball. Charlotte Edwards has a theory that short and wide is Perry’s one weakness at the moment, and she didn’t time that at all. The chop shot limped to point. Gordon is better aside from that ball. Bowls a maiden.119th over: Australia 307-3 (Perry 103, Haynes 77) Swat! That’s more like it. Haynes gets a ball from Sciver that isn’t really short, and she’s not exactly playing a pull shot – the arc of the bat across the line is diagonal, starting low and then lifting as it comes around her body. Lifting the ball over square leg for four. Haynes can motor in short-form cricket, so it would be good to see her tilt closer to that mode.118th over: Australia 302-3 (Perry 103, Haynes 73) Perry takes a single from Ecclestone casually, while Haynes skips down and tries to slam an off-drive, but only gets one run wide of mid-off. 117th over: Australia 301-3 (Perry 102, Haynes 72) Sciver resumes to Haynes, who tries a few shots but can’t beat the field. To be fair it does look hard to time attacking strokes out there. The wicket is becoming pretty lifeless. 116th over: Australia 301-3 (Perry 102, Haynes 72) A bit more proactive in the over before drinks, with Perry advancing to Ecclestone for a run, then Haynes trying a big swipe across the line for a couple. Here’s hoping they lift the tempo after a bev. The 300 is up, if you didn’t read the line at the top.115th over: Australia 297-3 (Perry 101, Haynes 69) Perry isn’t the type you associate with nerves, but she is getting nervous now. She steers to backward point and sets off for a run but gets sent back. Then again, the same process. Sciver bowls a third time. Perry flicks to midwicket and isn’t sure whether to run. She stutters enough, and so does Haynes, that midwicket throws at the non-striker’s end. And misses. And gets an overthrow to raise her hundred. Rather emblematic of England’s day. Two more singles follow.More emblematic, though, is Perry as a player in women’s cricket. She becomes the fourth woman to make tons in back-to-back matches. All the more special given she’s waited nearly two years between those chances. She’s gone 313 runs without being dismissed, a record in the women’s game. And she’s still going and could go all day. On top of taking a seven-wicket bag the other week. She is a cricketer dominating like few have at any level in the history of the sport, let alone internationally. 113th over: Australia 294-3 (Perry 99, Haynes 68) Ecclestone has to pull herself together to bowl now, and again Haynes blots up most of the over before finding a run. Someone with her experience should be more aware in this context. Perry keeps the strike for herself this time though by driving one through cover from the last ball. One run away.112th over: Australia 292-3 (Perry 98, Haynes 67) Oh, you have got to be kidding me. Dropped. Haynes is dropped, after this stubborn partnership has worn England’s fabric to frayed thread. There was the chance to end it. Error from the bat: Sciver bowled short, Haynes pulled in the air, straight to Ecclestone at square leg. Her weakness is her fielding, but that was as simple as they get. A bit of loop, just to her right, one she can take with a steady footing. And the ball just... pops out. England are going to lose by a million now. There’s nothing more deflating than that. And once again, Haynes soaks up five balls of strike so Perry can’t get a clear run at her hundred. This isn’t great batting, either.111th over: Australia 291-3 (Perry 98, Haynes 66) Perry doesn’t go for the milestone in the Nelson over. Content to do as she has done and drive a single from Ecclestone after advancing. Haynes does likewise. They’re just doing things at their own pace. 110th over: Australia 289-3 (Perry 97, Haynes 65) Now it’s Sciver to Haynes, who soaks up another over but this time she drives the fifth ball cleanly along the ground for four, rather than taking one. Perry gets strike for the next over. 109th over: Australia 285-3 (Perry 97, Haynes 61) With Perry closing on a century, it’s Haynes on strike as Sophie Ecclestone comes on for her first over of left-arm spin. She drops the ball into the rough outside the left-hander’s off stump, and Haynes defends four balls before taking a single. You’ll have to wait, Ellyse.108th over: Australia 284-3 (Perry 97, Haynes 60) Natalie Sciver on to have a bowl with her mediums. She had Healy nearly caught at midwicket yesterday. Bowls full and Perry drives her hard into the ground and bounces it back down the ground for four! A pragmatic sort of stroke. Sciver responds though with a beauty. Better length, just full enough to draw the shot but it swings, and beats Perry’s drive and her off stump by equally narrow margins. The TV folks are speculating she might have nicked it into Sarah Taylor’s shin pad, but I’m not sure she did. Sciver continues getting swing, but Perry flicks two runs square when the ball gets too straight.107th over: Australia 277-3 (Perry 90, Haynes 60) Haynes comes to life, crunching a pull shot off Shrubsole but straight to the field. She’s very quick on the short ball in short-form cricket, is Haynes. Shrubsole hoops one in onto the pads, but well down leg side. In the end Haynes jabs a run off her thigh pad, and Perry taps one into the covers. 106th over: Australia 275-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 59) Brunt round the wicket to the left-handed Haynes. One slip and a gully in position. Point, cover, extra cover, mid-off. Packed off side field with only mid-on and midwicket plus a long leg on the other side, so Haynes walks across her stumps and works the off-stump line to square leg. Sensible batting. Perry has a more conventional field, with one less cover moved over to square leg, Shrubsole set quite deep to give Brunt the option of the short ball and protect her from Perry’s very good pull shot. Perry tries a steer to deep third but finds gully on the bounce.105th over: Australia 274-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 58) Another maiden bowled, as Shrubsole works away at Perry’s off stump. This Australian pair look happy to just bat through this opening spell and then see where that leaves them as the day winds on. The beauty of playing without pressure to score. 104th over: Australia 274-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 58) Brunt bowls pretty straight at Haynes, trying to force her to play, but the Aussie v-c is comfortable defending from the crease. Blocks out a maiden.103rd over: Australia 274-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 58) Perry goes past 300 runs without dismissal in Test cricket, following her 213 at North Sydney in her previous Test. She punches Shrubsole away through cover for four, a bit airily but safely. Shrubsole responds with a few decent deliveries, pitching up a bit more, including one that beats the edge. 102nd over: Australia 270-3 (Perry 85, Haynes 58) Brunt to Perry, and this is the key match-up. If England don’t remove Australia’s top gun then she’ll fly all day. (Oh god that’s an accidental plug for the awful remake featuring a Tom Cruise who is now made of plasticine and an Ed Harris who is so, so sad that he’s still alive, sentences to some sort of Promethean fate of having to play cranky admirals for eternity.) Brunt angles a ball in and hits the pad, but it’s going well down leg. Perry blocks out and then pinches a single to end the over with a straight punch.101st over: Australia 269-3 (Perry 84, Haynes 58) Anya Shrubsole to start things off, and despite the heavy atmosphere there’s not much movement off the straight and narrow with this 20-over old ball. There is a chance though, as Shrubsole gives width and Haynes can’t resist slashing at the ball, getting a big top edge between gully and slip from the angled bat. Four runskis. Good news, we’re going to get a start on time. It may rain later, but we’ll battle on for the start. It’s so humid here today, and very warm. Sticky, heavy atmosphere. Let’s play. Here is your highly detailed local weather update: it was raining earlier. It is not raining now. It may be raining later. Give me a job!If there was one thing that stood out on the first day, it was the ruthlessness of this Australian team, even through a couple of patches where England competed. There’s something ominous about the way Australia has played in this series. Luckily I already wrote about it for you last night.Here we go again. There have been a lot of last-chance moments for England in the past few weeks and here is another one. For the England women’s team to have any chance of winning their Ashes series against Australia, they need to win this Test. To win this Test, they need to rattle through seven Australian wickets, make 500 runs, then take ten more wickets. In three days. It’s hard, but so was landing on the moon, which everyone keeps reminding us about this week. (This match is admittedly less strategically important in a propaganda war against the Russians.)For Australia though, it’s just a chance to bat and bat. Ellyse Perry is eyeing off a century, and that would be two in a row for the sport’s most obscenely gifted and hardest-working player. (That’s a winning combination.) Rachael Haynes has a fifty of her own and can see where that leads. And Australia don’t actually need to win, since a draw would deliver them the series trophy, but I’m guessing they’re still very keen to push for a result, not just bat things out.As long as the rain stays away, get set for an eventful morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/275ae5b3f02f191bb2d033712b94243726433dbe/0_76_5349_3209/master/5349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d73742b905a52dbe60775e0e44914e8e","title":"the open golf 2019 day two portrush live","story":"A fine up and down from sand at 15 by Jordan Spieth, who in doing so bodyswerves back-to-back birdies. He remains at -5. Meanwhile up on 18, Tyrrell Hatton nearly drains a long birdie putt, but has to settle for par and a 71. A slight stumble coming home, with bogey at 14 followed by that double-bogey calamity at Calamity, but he’ll be in good position going into Moving Day at -3. Once again he departs the scene all downcast - his only bogey yesterday came at 18 - but he’s playing some fine golf and promises to be a factor this weekend.One of the cheers of the day as Darren Clarke, a member of this club, birdies 3. He moves into red figures. Away up on 17, Tommy Fleetwood responds to the bogey at Calamity by nearly draining a long birdie putt. Par will do to steady the ship, and he remains a shot off the lead at -6. And Justin Harding, the late-blooming South African who tied for 12th at this year’s Masters, rakes in another birdie putt with his long flat stick. A third in four holes, and he’s -5 for both round and tournament.Tiger had been trying his best to somehow stay alive this weekend. Birdie at 3, then another at 6. But a short par putt missed at 7 has almost certainly put paid to any lingering hope. He’s back down at +6 now, and the cut is currently expected to send everyone at +2 and over home. Meanwhile a second bogey of the day for Spieth, always out of position on 14, but a second birdie in three holes for Justin Rose, rolling in a long one at 9. Spieth slips to -5, Rose rises to -4.Tiger is looking much more comfortable today, the troublesome back warmed by the rather pleasant temperatures. It’s not exactly sunbathing weather but Woods cuts a happier figure this morning. Of course, it helps if the putter heats up too and, after draining a big one at the opening hole, he sinks a 20-footer at 6 to go -2 for the day. At +5 overall, he still looks maybe two or three shots away from the cut line but he’s not giving this up easily. As if we would expect anything less from the 15-time major champ. A second bogey of the day for Fleetwood, who had whistled his tee shot at 16 into Hatton Territory. Unlike Tyrrell, who required three swishes to extricate himself from the jungle, Fleetwood whips out first time, high and onto the green. He’s left with a 12-foot chance to save his par, but can’t make it. So he drops out of the lead, which is the sole property of JB Holmes again. By the way, Holmes’ bogey on 9 was a nonsense, a short, straight putt not given enough juice and stopping apologetically short. Meanwhile a fourth birdie in five holes for Cameron Smith, at 12 another birdie for Harding, coming behind, also at 12 and four birdies in five holes for the brilliant Patrick Reed, at 3, 4, 6 and now 7. This really is bubbling up nicely!Thanks David. This is really hotting up now! With little wind around Portrush, the course is there for the taking. And plenty of players are taking advantage. Tony Finau birdies 8 to move to -4. Lucas Bjerregaard has birdied 2, 7 and 8 to rise to -4. Justin Harding has risen to -3 after eagle at 7 and birdie at 10. Meanwhile Erik van Rooyen is back home after parring every hole on the back nine. Out in 33, that means he’s signing for a 68, and is the early clubhouse leader at -4.How quickly fortunes switch. Tyrrell Hatton comes through his crisis moment by holing a brave 15-footer for bogey at 16 although there’s just a little confusion as the scoreboard in the press tent is showing double. Did he take a drop that we didn’t see? Meanwhile, Fleetwood blazes his tee-shot at that same 16th into deep rough. And to complete the ebb and flow at the top, Holmes makes his first mis-step of the day with a dropped shot at 9. Holmes now tied for the lead with Fleetwood.Just before I hand back to Scott, it emerges that Hatton did indeed take double at 16 so he’s back to -3 overall. Right, back to Mr Murray for further drama.Hatton making a meal of 16. His tee-shot goes left into the dense cabbage and his first hack out moves more turf than ball. For a horrible moment, it looks as if he’s simply pounded it further into the ground but a second chop finds the green. He’s staring at double bogey though and you sense it’s a massive moment in his tournament. But no such troubles for Tommy Fleetwood. Back at 15, the shaggy-haired one curls in a 25-footer for birdie and he hits the giddy heights of 7-under and just one off JB Holmes’ lead. Tiger is looking much more comfortable today, the troublesome back warmed by the rather pleasant temperatures. It’s not exactly sunbathing weather but Woods cuts a happier figure this morning. Of course, it helps if the putter heats up too and, after draining a big one at the opening hole, he sinks a 20-footer at 6 to go -2 for the day. At +5 overall, he still looks maybe two or three shots away from the cut line but he’s not giving this up easily. As if we would expect anything less from the 15-time major champ. Koepka knocks in his straightforward birdie putt at 13 to get to -5 and back to tied third. Meanwhile, his rival for ‘coolest in show’ category, Dustin Johnson, knocks in a ten-footer for birdie at 6. DJ’s card, like his walk, has a pleasing rhythm this morning: par-birdie-par-birdie-par-birdie. That’s lifted him to -2 and tied for 17th.Jordan Spieth is 4-under for his round and 5-under overall but we shouldn’t be surprised by his move today. A check of the PGA Tour’s scoring averages reveals why as it shows that the Dallas native does his best work of a Friday. Spieth ranks 16th in R1 scoring, 2nd in R2, 166th in R3 and 196th in R4. In other words, a typical Spieth performance this season involves a good start, a Friday surge and a gradual slide down the leaderboard on the weekend. He’ll need to reverse that final 36-hole trend to stay in the mix here but you suspect Spieth has something up his sleeve in majors. He’s won three and keeps likening Royal Portrush to Royal Birkdale, the scene of his Open triumph two years ago.The accelerator has been pressed here comes another birdie for Koepka. Buoyed by his par breaker at 12, he strikes a gorgeous tee shot to just outside four feet at the par-3 13th. That’s the mark of a champion just when it all looks a bit flat, they produce a sudden change of pace to get on the shoulder of the leader again. Back at 14, Hatton’s loose approach to the right leaves him a tough up and down from a little hollow and the up bit isn’t quite good enough and the putt doesn’t go down. The bogey drops him back to -5 and three behind.A frustrated slap of his club as Koepka chips to 12 but the ball rolls and rolls and only decides to stop when it’s waved goodbye to the hole some 15 feet behind it. And yet, the four-time major winner has plenty of ways to skin a cat and decides to knock in the putt to make his birdie that way. Koepka -4. Tommy Fleetwood now has back-to-back red numbers after another birdie putt drops at 13. He celebrates with a lovely drive at 14 and is now just two behind leader Holmes.While the par-5 12th should be a routine birdie in this weather, Brooks Koepka has word to do for his four. His approach is tugged left and into rough short of the green. The major monster is only evens for the day and that’s a surprise with others gathering birdies at a regular rate elsewhere on a kinder Royal Portrush today. No concerns yet for Koepka but he’ll want to go through the gears at some point and he’s running out of time this morning with the harder holes (14 to 18) to come.Tommy Fleetwood moves into joint-third after what is now an expected birdie at the par-5 12th. That’s three back from Holmes. As Scott mentioned, England has had just two Open champions in the last 50 years – Tony Jacklin in 1969 and Nick Faldo (1987, 1990, 1992). So what sweet music it would be if Hatton or Fleetwood lifted the claret jug. Talking of which, while I can imagine Sir Nick being quite a card at a Karaoke night, Jacklin once released his own album of pop standards (‘Swings Into’). I actually have this record (check Discogs for yours), and will argue with anyone that Tone’s version of Both Sides Now is up there with Joni Mitchell’s. Tommy’s quite theatrical I reckon he could croon out some ditties. Tyrrell perhaps more thrashy punk.Hello from Royal Portrush. This is Dave Tindall. Taps mic. Whistly feedback. Awkward silence. So, I didn’t expect JB Holmes to be five clear of Brooks Koepka when Scott departed stage left for a well-deserved break. Still, there it is and Holmes’ nearest challenger is now Tyrrell Hatton after the Englishman birdies 12 and just misses another good chance at 13. One story which popped up in a far corner of the media centre this morning involved one of JB’s practice rounds. Despite being regarded as one of the slowest players on the planet – and arguably other planets presuming they have golf courses and support life – Holmes was in a rush, twice ignoring marshal’s red flags and blasting tee-shots away regardless. The reason? He didn’t want to be late for a restaurant booking. There’s your cure for slow play then tell the tour’s worst plodders they have a table booked five hours on from their tee-time (I’ve worked in 45 minutes for freshening up and travel).A meltdown for Jon Rahm at the par-five 2nd. He’s down a swale to the left of the green. He putts up. The ball comes back at his feet. He tries again with a wedge. That one comes back too. A third go flies past the flag and off the front of the green. He runs up a double bogey seven, and clatters down to -1. He’s bubbling. Meanwhile a different sort of emotional scene on 18 as Tom Lehman says goodbye to the Open. No valedictory birdie, his putt shaving the lip, but it’s a par and he’s off into the sunset having shot 78-76 this week. He’s +12, but he’ll always have Lytham. The crowd salute him with the warmth he deserves, and he doffs his cap in thanks. A lovely moment.And with that, I’m away for a bit. David Tindall will be your guide for the next hour. Enjoy, enjoy!Another birdie for JB Holmes! This one comes at the par-three 6th, reward for a fine tee shot to 12 feet. A straight putt in, and suddenly he’s sitting on a three-shot lead, because Spieth’s approach to 9 finds a bunker from which he can’t get up and down. Bogey. He’s still turning in 32 strokes, though. And Cameron Smith of Australia, who has top-five finishes at the Masters and the US Open, but has done nix at the Open so far, birdies 2, 7 and 8 to get himself involved. “So glad you mentioned Laura Davies,” writes Hubert O’Hearn. “Yes, she is quite wonderful, isn’t she? My favourite bit of byplay was when Sky’s Ewen Murray asked her if she liked Tommy Fleetwood’s all-the-fashion golf shirt. ‘No, I don’t like it. You could wear it though.’ I love that! It’s the equivalent of sitting in a restaurant and one’s companion saying ‘This tastes awful! Here, try some.’ Splendid.”Adam Hadwin, from the middle of the 8th fairway, sends a one-bounce iron into the cup! The Canadian is going along very nicely today as a result, his eagle following birdies at 2 and 7, He’s -1. Kurt Kitayama, a 26-year-old Californian playing in the Open for the first time, and with two wins already this year on the European Tour, is on a hell of a tear today as well. Birdies at 3, 4, 7, 8 and now 12, with a sole bogey at 10, and he’s whistled 65 places up the leaderboard to -1. Meanwhile a rare backwards step by An Byeong-hun, who had birdied 2, 4, 7, 12 and 15, but finally sheds a stroke at 16. He’s -2.An astonishing par save by Tyrrell Hatton on 11! Having flayed his drive into triffids down the right of the fairway, he just about managed to hack his ball back onto the semi-rough. You could only just see his head poking out of the verdant wilds. His third into the green wasn’t all that, either, his ball rolling off the back. But he guides in a 35-footer to remain at -5! But he’s two off the top now, because up on 5, Holmes birdies to re-establish sole ownership of the lead.Jordan Spieth is responsible for one of the iconic Open moments: that odyssey down 13 at Birkdale a couple of years ago. The sheer lunacy of his sortie to the practice range tends to obscure the brilliance of what came after he limited the damage to bogey. Birdie, eagle, birdie, birdie. Title sealed. Well, he’s doing something very similar today. A 25-foot rake across 8, and it’s another birdie! He’s five under for the last four holes, after going birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie. He’s grabbed himself a share of the lead. You have got to love this guy. Sky Sports have got a new commentator in their ranks this week: the four-time major winner Laura Davies. She’s a great listen. Witty, easy-going and informative, she’s always on hand to immediately explain the lay of the land and the many shot options available to the players, something not always apparent watching links golf in 2D. Expertise, experience and knowledge lightly worn. She’s also had a righteous pop at folk who moan about the coverage given over to Tiger - “Why wouldn’t you want to watch him?!” - and as an aside written off VAR in football as the pointless fiasco it is. Marvellous.Never mind par for Tiger! He curls in a big left-to-right breaker from 25 feet, and that’s an opening birdie that brings him back to +6. Here comes hope! A broad smile as he considers the prospect of one of the great cut-dodging rounds. Buckle in, folks! Then up on 7, Jordan Spieth rolls in a putt from the swale to the right of the green, and that’s an eagle that catapults him into a share of second! Fleetwood saves his par on 9, three scrambles on the bounce! And to complete a manic minute, Justin Rose birdies 2. It’s all happening! Again!Tiger’s got a good lie in the rough down 1, and finds the green with his second. Two putts, and he should escape with par. Fleetwood is once again scrambling for par, having driven wildly down 9. Forced to chip back out, he wedges to eight feet from 100 yards. A chance to save himself yet again. Meanwhile Oosthuizen misses another tiddler, this time at 8, this time at the cost of a shot. He slips to -2.Tiger time! Having shot 78 yesterday, weekend participation is pretty much a pipe dream, the way he’s been playing since that spine-tingling victory at Augusta. And yet there’s electricity in the gallery regardless as he takes to the tee. Star quality. You either have it or you don’t. However the early signs aren’t good, as he pulls another stiff one into the thick stuff down the left. Patrick Reed meanwhile unsheathes a wood and larrups his opening drive down the middle. A street-fighting level-par 71 yesterday for the 2018 Masters champion, who gets a raw PR deal in the HBH’s book, and accordingly very much has our support. It’d be great to see him in the mix come Sunday, after a quiet time since his breakthrough major victory.After two pars that feel like bogeys, here’s a par that has the warm, fuzzy sensation of birdie. Fleetwood sinks a 30-foot right-to-left slider on 8. Always out of position, that could be a momentum changer in the wake of his struggle down 7. Two par scrambles in a row, and he remains at -4. Tony Finau meanwhile yips from short distance at the opening hole, and he starts with a miserable bogey. Back to -2 for the big man.Hatton is one turn away from birdie on 8, after knocking his second to 15 feet. The putt not quite the quality of the approach. Back on 7, Koepka elects to chip. And he doesn’t really commit to it, his ball stopping six feet short. He tugs his birdie putt left. What a waste of two fine shots. A par that’ll feel like a bogey. Ditto Oosthuizen, who yips a birdie tiddler. Holmes isn’t far from making his eagle putt at 2, but birdie will do to regain sole ownership of the lead. And it’s back-to-back birdies for Spieth at 6. He’s in the mood for this, suddenly in the mix.Like Oosthuizen before him, Spieth follows birdie at 5 with a forensic tee shot at 6. He’ll have a very good look at birdie from eight feet. Up on 7, Koepka sends his ball just over the back of the green with two huge hits. He’ll be thinking about bumping up a chip, or possibly putting, from the swale. An outside eagle chance. Up and down for birdie. Meanwhile back on 2, the co-leader Holmes is pin high in two. A 25-foot eagle putt coming up.A first birdie of the day for Jordan Spieth, at 5, and he’s quietly moving back in the right direction after a mid-round wobble yesterday. The 2017 winner is -2. Tommy Fleetwood escapes with his par on 7. Erik van Rooyen is inches away from draining a long birdie putt at 9, but he’ll be content enough to turn in 33. Yet another birdie for An Byeong-hun, his fourth of the day, at 12 he’s -2 and increasingly a factor in this tournament. And Lee Westwood’s birdie effort on 1 is miserable, always turning off to the right. A chance for the fastest of starts spurned.Lee Westwood must be thoroughly fed up with his eternal bridesmaid status. With a view to addressing this misery, he sends his approach at the opening hole pin high to ten feet. That’s a lovely shot. Birdie putt coming up that may inform the rest of his round. Meanwhile on 7, Fleetwood is halfway up a steep hill, his feet miles below a snagged ball. Two bunkers in between him and the green. He does extremely well to clip his ball into the swale to the right of the green a chance to get up and down for par from there.A no-sweat par for Holmes at the opening hole. He’s now sharing his lead with Hatton, of course the Englishman can only par the 7th. They’re both -5. Coming behind, Fleetwood would take that par right now, as he lashes a long iron into the bonny heather well to the right of the green. Halfway up a big slope, he’ll have a puzzle to solve getting back down.Back-to-back birdies for Oosthuizen! He follows up his easy-going birdie at the short par-four 5th by swishing an effortless iron towards the flag at the par-three 6th. He’s eight feet away, and in goes the putt. He joins his partner Koepka at -3, the current PGA champion unable to covert a decent opportunity from 12 feet. Par.Here comes the overnight leader JB Holmes! Easy to forget that, were it not for the freakish, other-worldly, once-in-a-generation antics of Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson at Troon in 2016, Holmes would already be an Open champion. He was the best of the rest that week, a mere 14 shots shy of Stenson, 11 behind Lefty. OK, OK, but you get the point. A wonderful 66 yesterday, and he opens his second round by splitting the fairway.Koepka is really trying it on at 5. If he creams his drive, he’s surely bumping through the green and out of bounds, with the white stakes only a couple of feet behind. So he creams his drive ... and is fortunate that he’s a tad off line, so his ball snags in rough at the front right of the green. Then he chips aggressively, unable to get any spin from the curly kale. His ball is only a few joules of energy shy of rolling through the green and OB. Like Frank Costanza, it stops short. He should escape with par with a couple of putts from the fringe. Yep, four. Lucky Brooks. He’s -3. Birdie meanwhile for Oosthuizen, who drove the green and took a couple of wise putts. Much more sensible. He’s -2.A shame for Van Rooyen, who sets his six-foot eagle putt off to the left, and it’s never turning back. A misread. But it’s his third birdie today. Such a shame, though, because the long iron in was so sweet. Still, he’s just one off the lead now ... a lead shared by Hatton, who makes his birdie at 6 without fuss or drama. And it’s all happening at the top, because Fleetwood gets up and down from the side of the risk-reward short par-four 5th (it’s driveable, but there’s OB just over the back) and makes birdie. Look at how this is hotting up, and it’s only just gone 9am on the Friday!There could be some more movement atop the leaderboard soon. Hatton has just caressed a gorgeous iron at the par-three 6th to six feet. Meanwhile up on the par-five 7th, Van Rooyen nearly pipes an iron into the cup from the fairway for an albatross! The ball bounds a few feet past the hole, so eagle’s not a gimme. But he should be making birdie at the very least from there. For the record, it would have been the first albatross at the Open since Paul Lawrie lashed one in from distance at the 7th hole at Turnberry in 2009.Koepka goes backwards for only the second time this week. He’s very fortunate with his tee shot on 4, the ball sticking on the shoulder of a bunker and refusing to topple back in. However he comes up short with his second and, shortsided, does well to chip to 15 feet. But he can’t make the putt. He’s back to -3, his place at -4 taken by Tyrrell Hatton, who birdies 5 to move within a shot.A second bogey of the day for Justin Thomas, who misses a short one on 4. He throws his putter away in frustration. He’s +2. Much more of this, and he’ll have to start fretting about the cut. A long way to go, of course, but early guesswork, nothing more, suggests it might fall around +3 or +4. Meanwhile Ryan Fox arrests his early morning slide with birdie at 5. He’s -2.Koepka sends his tee shot at 3 into the swale to the left of the green. No matter: he just gracefully scoops his wedge to a couple of feet, and tidies up for par. For a player with a boom-boom reputation, he’s got such a delicate touch around the greens. He’s the complete player. Meanwhile a second birdie of the day for the increasingly impressive Erik van Rooyen the 29-year-old South African has been hanging around the leaderboards at the majors for much of the last year. A breakthrough could be a-coming, because he moves to -3, sinking a 15-foot putt at 5 after leaving an eagle attempt egregiously short. Two men with ice in the veins.While Koepka was making his birdie at 2, Sharma was doing the same, repairing the damage of the opening hole. He’s back to -1. Oosthuizen was busy making a disappointing three-putt par. He stays at -1. A fast start meanwhile for Thomas Pieters, who birdies 2 and 4 to move to -1. The big Belgian has top-ten finishes at the Masters and the PGA under his belt, but he’s done little at the Open. Time to make good, perhaps.An Byeong-hun hasn’t really done anything in the majors to date. But the 27-year-old from Seoul finished the recent US Open tied for 16th, his best effort yet. And he could be in the mood to trump that this week. He’s followed up his early birdie at 2 with others at 4 and 7. He’s whistled 52 places up the leaderboard to -1. Meanwhile on 2, Koepka nearly drains his eagle putt, but taps in for birdie. The first positive move at the toppermost of the poppermost:Bounce-back birdie for Tommy Fleetwood at 2. All down to a lovely second into the meat of the green. His eagle putt wasn’t too far away. Coming behind, Brooks Koepka sends his second at the par-five pin high. He’ll have a relatively straight look at eagle from 25 feet or so.Golf is such a wonderfully weird game. Ryan Fox couldn’t stop making birdies yesterday afternoon now, not much more than 14 hours later, the new record holder for the low back nine at the Open can’t stop making bogeys He follows up his mistake at 1 with a short yip at 3, and he’s down to -1 already.Another par for Hatton at 2. Greenside in two, his chip on doesn’t spin back to set up a makeable birdie putt. Still, he remains at -3. Back on 1, Koepka powers his second from the thick stuff into the heart of the green, then lips out from 25 feet. So close to a sensational turnaround in fortune after that poor tee shot. But he’ll have taken his par. Oosthuizen pars as well. But it’s a first bogey of the week for Shubhankar Sharma, who makes up this group, the result of a wayward tee shot. He was only half a turn away from salvaging his par, too. A breakthrough statement can’t be long in coming for the 22-year-old from India. A high finish this week could be it.Fleetwood’s first putt, from the fringe to the side of 1, is woefully underhit. He leaves himself a 30-foot hope for par, and the putt’s never going in. He slips back to -2. And his partner Thomas can’t get up and down from the sand, so he’s going the wrong way as well he’s +1. But up on 2, Erik van Rooyen rattles one in from distance, and the early birdie takes up up to -2. The 29-year-old South African is beginning to make his name in the majors, after good showings in last year’s Open, and this year’s US Open and PGA. Someone to keep an eye on this week.Here comes the world number one, Brooks Koepka! The gallery gives him the ovation he deserves. But his opening tee shot isn’t up to standard. Like Fleetwood before him, he toys with the OB stakes down the left, and is pleased to see his ball nestle in the thick rough and refuse point blank to bounce towards serious scorecard-related bother. Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 champion, is a bit braver than most: instead of playing it safe with iron, he takes a fairway wood. And claps it down the middle. There are only three players under 30 with a major to their name. Justin Thomas is one. (Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka are the others.) The 2017 PGA champ has a reasonable lie down the right of 1. But he undercooks his second, the ball stopping short of the green and turning off into a bunker to the left. A tricky up and down to come. Tommy Fleetwood makes a much better fist of his second from the left, powering his ball pin high, just off the side of the green to the right. He’ll have taken that for sure when he was anxiously watching his tee shot sail towards the out-of-bounds markers. Now all he needs to do is get up and down. No biggie.A huge reception for Tommy Fleetwood as he tees it up. But the crowd fall quiet as his ball whistles towards the OB down the left. Fortunately it snags in the thick rough just before the white posts. Lucky Tommy. Justin Thomas, who salvaged his round yesterday after a slow start, ending up with a level-par 71, finds the cabbage down the right. Up on the green, Tyrrell Hatton leaves his birdie effort well short, but salvages the situation with a hard-as-nails par saver from 12 feet. That’ll give him heart. A dropped shot on 1 after bogey at 18 yesterday might have sent a notoriously emotional player off into a tailspin. But he looks pretty happy with that.All hot streaks must come to an end. Ryan Fox birdied six of his last seven holes last night, but he’s bogeyed his first today. On in regulation, he trundled a hot birdie effort miles past the cup, and couldn’t save himself coming back. He slips to -2, then sends his drive at the par-five 2nd into sand on the left, so his chances of bouncing back with a birdie on one of Portrush’s more forgiving holes are immediately diminished. Tyrrell Hatton would be one off the lead were it not for a closing-hole bogey yesterday evening. Heart on sleeve as ever, he looked thoroughly deflated after finishing with his only dropped shot of the day. But you can’t knock an opening round of 68 at the Open. A good round this morning, when the weather’s kind, and he’ll be set fair for the weekend. England hasn’t had an Open champion since Nick Faldo won at Muirfield in 1992. Pre-Faldo, the English are looking at Tony Jacklin in 1969. Before that, it’s Max Faulkner, the 1951 winner at ... Royal Portrush. Some sort of sign? OK, it’s a stretch. But it’s got to happen sometime. He knocks his tee shot down the middle, then sends his second pin high, albeit just off the putting surface to the right.Ryan Fox hasn’t got much of a track record in the majors. The 32-year-old from Auckland’s best showing in one of the big ones is a tie for 27th in last year’s PGA at Bellerive. But he’s now got a record in the majors: yesterday afternoon he birdied 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18, a blitz that saw him come back in 29 strokes, a new Open best. The previous record of 30 was set by Eric Brown at Lytham in 1958, and was since matched by Tommy Nakajima (1986 Troon), Ross Drummond (Muirfield 1987), Mark Brooks (Turnberry 1994), Phil Mickelson (St Andrews 2000), Stuart Appelby (Muirfield 2002), Kenichi Kuboya (Turnberry 2009), Rory McIlroy (St Andrews 2010) and Justin Rose (last year at Carnoustie). But you can strike through all of that now. Fox receives a warm ovation as he tees it up this morning, then cracks his iron down the track. He’s -3, the first of the leading pack out today.The first birdies of the second round, and they both go to South Koreans. An Byeong-hun, coming off the back of a decent showing at Pebble Beach in the US Open, moves to +1 after picking up a shot at 2. Meanwhile Innchoon Hwang, playing in the Open for the first time at 44, birdies the opening hole, reward for a delightful second arrowed straight at the flag. He’s level par now.Rory’s not long for this championship either. Here’s Andy Bull’s take on his head-spinning horror show yesterday.You’ll need some reading matter to go with that breakfast cuppa. Here’s Tiger on his sore back. Get him while you can, because he won’t be here this weekend.It’s sunny and relatively still this morning at Portrush. But don’t expect it to stay that way forever. It’ll begin to cloud over soon enough. The morning is expected to stay dry, the odd squall excepted, but the chances of showers increase in the afternoon. We should avoid heavy rain, but don’t bet the farm on it, this is links golf, this is the Open Championship. The wind should be gentle all day, though the aforementioned don’t-risk-the-mortgage caveat remains.Lehman’s errant drive leads to a bogey. Not the ideal start to the champ’s valedictory round. He slips to +8. Niemann’s salvage bid looks doomed as he too drops a shot he’s +6. Jimenez is the only one of the three to make par, but he remains at +11. It’ll be a wee while before things hot up this morning. Plenty of time to make yourself a cup of coffee.The 1996 Champion Golfer gets the second day’s play underway. Tom Lehman, at 60 exempt for the final time, is most likely playing his last round at the Open today, having shot 78 yesterday. He sends his opening tee shot into a fairway bunker to the right. He’ll be going round with the current Senior Open champion Miguel Angel Jimenez, who ran up an 82 yesterday and is just biding time until he defends his title next week. The 20-year-old Chilean prospect Joaquin Niemann makes up the three-ball. He’s got plenty of work to do today if he’s to extend his Open debut into the weekend, having shot 76 yesterday.Yesterday, JB Holmes shot 66, Tiger carded 78, Rory McIlroy took 79, Ryan Fox came back in 29, Emiliano Grillo aced 13, and David Duval ran up 14 on 7. If today has half as many jaw-dropping moments, we’ll be doing pretty well. Here’s how the top of the leaderboard looks after the first round ...... and here are today’s tee times. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5fa3ae03650ae4bced5a946b8ddfbab6e06984/102_166_3304_1982/master/3304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91a8f2791bdd11487cb7cc33a9ce7ac9","title":"tour de france 2019 individual time trial on stage 13 and la course live","story":"While passing through the feed zone yesterday, Rohan Dennis decided to dismount his bicycle and quit this year’s Tour. Almost 24 hours later, mystery continues to surround the Australian’s decision. The world ITT champion, Dennis was among the favourites for today’s stage, but abandoned the Tour despite not being ill or injured. Although he was spotted near his team bus at the end of the stage, he refused to speak to reporters and his team were vague when asked about what happened too.“We actually expected a big effort from him tomorrow,” said Bahrain-Merida sports director Gorazd Stangelj. “It was his decision today to stop in the feed zone. We tried to speak with him. He said, ‘I don’t want to talk’ and just abandoned the race. His condition is not bad, he’s good enough to perform at the Tour de France. For sure it has nothing to do with his condition.”A notoriously spiky character, Dennis is rumoured to be unhappy with the Merida time trial bike he is obliged to use because of his team’s sponsors. Speaking to Lance Armstrong’s The Move podcast, former Radioshack and US Postal team director Johan Bruyneel, suggested there was also talk that Dennis spat the dummy because there was something wrong with the skin-suit he was due to wear today. It didn’t fit, or hadn’t turned up ... something like that. While Bruyneel’s every utterance should be taken with several shovelfuls of salt, for obvious reasons, he is exceptionally well connected in the world of professional cycling, so there may well be more than a grain of truth to what he is saying. With the ladies finished, it’s time to return our focus to the gentlemen, who have their Race of Truth this afternoon. Marianne Vos and chums did five laps of the circuit they’ll have to complete this afternoon. While this is ostensibly a day off for the majority of riders, it should go some way towards sorting out the men among the GC contenders from the boys. But first, a recap on stage three, which was won by Mitchelton Scott rider Simon Yates yesterday. Jeremy Whittle was there for the  ... V for Victory (and Vos): Marianne Vos takes her second La Course, having won her first five years ago on different terrain. “I feel really good, I came with good motivation from the Giro Rosa,” she says, having won four stages in the Italian race. Heartbreak for Amanda Spratt as Marianne Vos sweeps past her on the final climb with just 300 metres to go, pulls away from her and wins at her leisure to CCC Live. 500m to go: Spratt hits the ramp near the finish, but is passed by Marianne Vos. 1km to go: Spratt gets out of the saddle again, while Trek Segafredo go to the front of the bunch. 2.0km to go: Spratt ploughs on, her face a mask of pain. The peloton can see her ... 2.5km to go: Spratt leads by 12 seconds. At the front of the bunch, CCC Liv and Team Sunweb finally appear to have got their act together and are hunting her down. 6km to go: Hats off to Annemiek van Vleuten, Spratt’s team-mate, who is successfully disrupting any efforts the bunch are making to get themselves organised. At the moment, Riejanne Markus of CCC-Liv is trying to tow them along to get her team-mate Vos into contention. 7km to go: The gap from Amanda Spratt to the chasing posse goes back out to 33 seconds, then back into 19. Can she hang on? 7.5km to go: Spratt is out of the saddle, her legs pumping . The gap is back out to 20 seconds in the wake of the aforementioned indecision and disorganisation in the pack, where the riders are squabbling over how best to organise their chase. 10km to go: Some indecision in the peloton, where Van Vleuten is policing the bunch on behalf her Aussie teammate up the road. 11km to go: The peloton has Spratt in their sights, her lead now down to just nine seconds. 12km to go: It’s worth noting that Spratt’s Dutch team-mate, Annemiek van Vleuten is trying to win her third consecutive La Course title. She is currently chasing down Lucinda Brand and Marianne Vos, who are trying to bridge the gap from the peloton to Spratt. The gap is dissolving, however.16km to go: Marianne Vos and her CCC Liv domestiques are towing the bunch along as Spratt, who was previously in a five-woman breakaway before dropping her travelling companions and striking for home on her own. La Course: You join us with 17 kilometres left of this year’s La Course, a race in which Annemiek van Vleuten, Anna van der Breggen, Marianne Vos and Lizzie Deignan are among the field of big-name cyclists riding five laps of the Inidual Time Trial course their male counterparts will tackle in the Inidual Time Trial later this afternoon. Described today by the Dame Sarah Storey as “a token gesture” even if “it’s better to have any race than no race”, this year’s La Course is currently being led by Mitchelton Scott rider Amanda Spratt, who has a lead of 28 seconds over the chasing pack. William Fotheringham: “At least one or two of the favourites who are weaker time triallists should be effectively put out of the reckoning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/789e8feeafb24fd4ec258d794f27d0f6c1a7ce77/0_21_5264_3158/master/5264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=084a4508ce1eac1a481e29a366986942","title":"calling at all stations tube passengers to get 4g reception from next year","story":"4G mobile technology will launch on Jubilee line and will be extended to other linesLondon Underground passengers will be able to use their phones in tunnels between stations from early next year, removing one of the last major public places in Britain without phone reception and creating new challenges to commuter etiquette.Transport for London confirmed to the  that 4G mobile phone technology would go live in tunnels on most of the Jubilee line from March 2020 and on other lines in the coming years.The move raises the prospect of commuters making and receiving phone calls while packed into typically largely chat-free tube carriages.Mark Bulle, TfL’s head of infrastructure transformation, acknowledged that passenger behaviour could change. “People could have their commute interrupted – but at the end of the day it’s up to people whether they take the call from their boss.”However, he expects most people to instead use the connection for data services, and he said it should be fast enough to allow uninterrupted viewing of video streams. “You should be able to stream live sports,” he said.Mobile phone coverage has been standard in many subway systems around the world for several years, with some cities such as Moscow offering commuters both wifi and mobile phone connections. Even the Channel tunnel has a 4G signal, but until now London commuters have had to rely on the wifi system available only in stations – resulting in a rush to log on at the moment a train pulls into the platform.The capital’s underground network, the world’s oldest subway network, poses a challenge because many of the lines are built in narrow tunnels that often bend to follow the route of public roads on the surface, making it harder for signals to travel along them. TfL is adopting a model based on “leaky feeders” – essentially running cables through tunnels that act as giant aerials.The upgrade, which will ultimately require around 2,000km of new cabling, is being installed in conjunction with a much-delayed Home Office-mandated 4G telephone network for the emergency services, saving the need to fit two different sets of equipment.While TfL is picking up the bill for initial trial on the Jubilee line extension between Canning Town and Westminster, it will soon award a contract to a private operator which will install 4G equipment within all of London’s tube tunnels by the mid-2020s. Mobile phone networks will then pay the private operator for access to the network, with the transport authority receiving a cut of profits.Installation of the network is complicated by the decision to introduce 24-hour tube services, which limits the amount of access that engineering staff have to the tunnels. There are no plans to install a 5G network within the tunnels owing to the substantial amount of equipment that would be required.The introduction of mobile phone reception could have a negative impact on London’s free print publications such as the Evening Standard, which rely on attracting the attention of commuters on the tube.Similar schemes are being considered on the UK’s other underground rail networks. Merseyrail is installing a wifi network in its Liverpool tunnels, and the Glasgow Subway is experimenting with 5G services. Newcastle commuters could feel London is playing catch-up, having had 2G mobile signal on the limited sub-surface sections of the Tyne \u0026amp Wear  since 2004, with upgrades to more modern technology due to start in the autumn.Although the UK’s four mobile phone networks are is still in negotiations about accessing the new equipment in London’s tube tunnels, TfL expects that customer demand will ensure they all provide services on the move. “Our suspicion is that none of them will want to be left behind,” said Bulle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8a53fc97065996623c2dcd94325a6300ec37ab/0_10_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdf4b0ffb5011b524456c7feba3c90fc","title":"beckenham place park lewisham london lake woods rewilding","story":"A former golf course in Lewisham has been transformed into south-east London’s biggest park. Our writer, a local, explores the new gardens, swimming lake and wildflower meadows ahead of its opening this weekendAncient oaks and luxuriant lawns stretch away from a spectacular Palladian mansion. A crescent-shaped lake glints amid trees in a shallow valley. People linger over picnics and wander off to woodland glades, kids kick balls around, soul music washes over us and people emerge from the mansion holding glasses of wine.This isn’t a summer function at a stately home but a “new” municipal park in south-east London, nine miles from Trafalgar Square, on the cusp of its official opening on 20 July. The opening coincides with a week-long festival marking London becoming a National Park City (20-28 July), a Mayor of London initiative designed to make the capital greener and healthier.So where has all this green space been hiding? Beckenham Place Park was a public golf course for more than 100 years in the 1990s it was among the busiest 18-hole public courses in London, perhaps Europe. Sporting legends, such as footballer Ian Wright, cut their golfing teeth there, as did less-stellar sports enthusiasts, such as myself.But in the late 2000s golf seemed to lose its allure and the local authority decided – amid much protest – to close the course and restore the park for the benefit of the wider community. As the course died its slow death, dog walkers would roam the fairways. The course finally closed in October 2016.Like many, I assumed new flats and supermarkets would shoot up on the site but this was never Lewisham council’s plan. Now the 96-hectare space, one of London’s largest council-owned parks, has been remoulded as a recreational and natural attraction with the help of around £5m of Heritage Lottery grant. And already it’s attracting greater numbers than previously, drawn by the freedom to roam green spaces, and by the happy ambience at the mansion, with its groovy music, pop-up bar, yoga, arts and crafts, and vinyl store.But the jewel in the park’s crown is the new 283-metre-long, 45-metre-wide lake, a recreation of an original Georgian water feature. Its source, says programme manager Gavin Plaskitt, is a combination of an aquifer reached by a new borehole, ground water and an existing stream. Reeds and other aquatic plants absorb unwanted nutrients in the water and oxygen pumps keep the water, which at its greatest depth is 3.5 metres, healthy. A beach area neatly shelves into shallow water for younger children to splash around in.On recent balmy evenings some locals, tired of waiting for the official opening, pushed aside the barriers to take to the inviting water. One older man, Alf, told me: “I only moved here a couple of years back. I can’t believe my luck with a place like this opening up on my doorstep. I’m over the moon, but I want it all to myself!” A former triathlete, iron man and boxer, he says the new lake will encourage him to get back into regular training. “The water is superb,” he says, “but I hope they do a deal where you don’t have to pay much if you’re over 60.”With its lake, a 5km figure-of-eight running route and cycle tracks, the park should become a centre for triathletes. It is holding its first triathlon in October. From next week, swimmers will pay £3 a session. There will be Canadian canoes for hire, and paddleboarding lessons and sessions are in the planning, too.The initiative is accompanied by a major effort to improve and bolster natural habitats. East of the lake, a wooded wetland habitat is being created, a rewilding venture aimed at creating a fauna- and flora-rich environment, and boosting bioersity. A raised path alongside it leads deeper into the woods. “Already we’ve seen dragonflies, and birds like little egrets turning up,” says Plaskitt, who is now watching his vision of six years ago bearing fruit. Throughout its golf course years, the park was a well-known natural space, carefully tended by the Friends of Beckenham Place Park. Among its natural treasures are ancient trees (including wild service, turkey oak and wych elm), swathes of bluebells and birds such as firecrests, woodpeckers and owls. But now ponds are being cleaned out and wildflower meadows are taking over what used to be fairways. During my visit, the cackle of the ubiquitous local parakeets was the prevalent birdsong – as it was during my golf rounds, when they would appear to be loudly mocking my wayward shots into the rough.Dave de Silva leads birdwatching trips in the woods and along the Ravensbourne river, which runs through the east of the park. “Part of me feels a sense of nostalgia. When it was less well-used, the place had a feeling of space and emptiness – unusual round here.”He admits it’s taking a little time for him to get used to seeing people roaming all over the grassy areas and, as a birder, fears that music from the mansion might not be conducive to the autumn migration watch, but “the new habitats will definitely attract more species”.De Silva is, however, a fan of the new gardens, still a work in progress: “They’re looking brilliant.”I walk with Plaskitt up to the gardens, past an attractive new adventure playground. Beyond is an 18th-century stable block and homestead cottages with clock tower, now restored after a fire in 2011. Here, there are plans for another cafe.Plaskitt looks on as volunteers busy themselves with mulch, seedlings and wheelbarrows. He remembers a time a few years back when there was “a crazy level of opposition”. Now, though, he feels the level of community participation shows that the ambitious plans have been accepted. “The park wasn’t being used that much. There were periods when there were only 45 golfers a day on average, and hours would go by when we’d only see three or four dog walkers here.”There’ll also be a much larger playground here, a magnet for kids on this side of the park, which borders less well-off neighbourhoods such as Downham and Bellingham.I stop for a beer back at the mansion before cycling home slightly in awe of the project’s ambition, remembering how, in the 1980s, many of London’s open-air swimming pools disappeared and playing fields were sold off to developers. But at Beckenham Place Park it feels as though these negative trends have suddenly gone into reverse.I may still clear the cobwebs from my golf clubs from time to time, but I’ll be needing a decent wetsuit for future visits to the park.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

But then the streaming giant threw $100m at it and now the low-stakes charm has been lostComedians in Cars Getting Coffee was a nice idea at the time. It was a fun, low-stakes YouTube series where you could spend quarter of an hour watching Larry David or Chris Rock shoot the breeze in a cafe. It wasn’t the smartest show. It wasn’t the funniest. Its entertainment value largely depended on how much you liked the subject. But that was the fun of it. Jerry Seinfeld didn’t need the money, and you didn’t need to love it. It was just there as a nice little ersion something to watch at your desk while you ate a sandwich at work.But then Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee jumped ship to Netflix, and something has changed. The charm has been lost, and as a result it’s genuinely difficult to stir any emotion whatsoever about its new season.The difference can be boiled down to three main areas. First, and most overwhelmingly, there’s the money. In 2017, Netflix announced that it had bought Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee – along with two Jerry Seinfeld standup specials, one of which was formed of archive material – for $100m. And that’s ridiculous. Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee isn’t a $100m television show. It isn’t The Crown. It’s a collection of videos where two people sit next to each other and chit-chat to a Go-Pro. That’s all. As soon as you start assigning enormous worth to a show like that, it’s bound to alter your perception.If something is slung up on YouTube without fanfare, your expectations are ultimately zero. But when you learn that it cost twice the national GDP of Tuvalu, you can’t help but expect something. And not necessarily something spectacular. You might just expect something like basic production values or a soundtrack that doesn’t sound like it’s ripped directly from the Garageband preset list. And yet the episodes of Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee that aired after the Netflix acquisition have been exactly the same in terms of look and feel as the ones that came before it.There’s a huge difference in platform between Netflix and YouTube. When something airs on YouTube, it airs for free and its competition is makeup tutorials and cat videos. Compared to YouTube, Netflix is The Ritz. It’s a destination. You pay for Netflix out of your wages, and you expect something of quality in return. You expect cutting-edge drama and amazing comedy. Putting something as tossed-off as Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee on Netflix cheapens the platform and makes the show look worse than ever by comparison.And then there’s the matter of the guests. In its infancy Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee felt like a hobby, like Jerry Seinfeld had thought about which of his friends would make the most interesting subjects. So we saw Larry David talking about old times and fussing over food. We saw Alec Baldwin at his most charming and gregarious. We even saw Ricky Gervais at his least obnoxious.But the show is a product now. It’s a treadmill, 90 episodes long, and quality control is lapsing. This isn’t a byproduct of the Netflix buy-out, incidentally, because the show’s nadir arguably came before that with the Christoph Waltz episode, which wasn’t just a betrayal of the premise but a slab of flabby filler to boot. The big name of this upcoming series is Eddie Murphy, but it’s surrounded by guests that elicit little more than a shrug. Matthew Broderick. Sebastian Maniscalco. Ricky Gervais again. It doesn’t exactly seem essential, which is has to be now it’s competing with actual television programmes.YouTube has got on fine without Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. There’s a newer – and better – low-stakes interview show now in the form of Hot Ones, where guests like Trevor Noah and The Jonas Brothers answer questions while being assailed by dangerously spicy food. Like Seinfeld’s show, it isn’t going to change the world. Like Seinfeld’s show, it’s a fun enough lunchtime watch. And, like Seinfeld’s show, it will absolutely fall apart the moment that Netflix pays $100m for the rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b409c0ee8e003ddf3397eb22e43f6b9cd94fa3d4/91_471_2651_1591/master/2651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5307acec07674430510079fb4a9fef0","title":"chinas uighur policy is human rights stain of the century pompeo","story":"US secretary of state says mass detentions of Muslim minority is among ‘worst crises of our time’The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has accused China of being responsible for the human rights “stain of the century” with mass detentions of Muslims and other minorities.Speaking at an international religious freedom conference that he is hosting in Washington, Pompeo denounced China for its large-scale detentions in the western Xinjiang region, where an estimated 1 million Muslim Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities are believed to be held in internment camps.Chinese officials describe the camps as vocational training centers and say they are necessary to curb religious extremism.China is “home to one of the worst human rights crises of our time”, said Pompeo, who also accused China of intimidating countries into staying away from his conference.Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, has made promoting religious freedom a priority since becoming secretary of state. But critics of the Trump administration have questioned the commitment, noting that its restrictive migration policies threaten religious minorities.The conference was being held just days after the International Rescue Committee and the UN refugee agency warned that the administration’s sharp reductions in admissions of refugees and asylum seekers put many, including religious minorities, at risk.“The Trump administration cannot cheer on the world to protect religious minorities in one breath, while substantively cutting its own protections for these groups in the next,” said Nazanin Ash, the IRC’s vice president of global policy and advocacy.The Trump administration has also been criticised for not taking a tougher line on China’s religious record by imposing sanctions. Some believe that administration officials have not taken that step for fear of endangering trade talks with China.Vice president Mike Pence, speaking at the same conference, said the talks would not get in the way of America’s commitment to religious freedom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/284725bf2831fdeb72d6e33f1c192240da0b72ef/0_367_5862_3517/master/5862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=998939769c496c62c9d467828c627d4e","title":"bear wood project brings lost species back to uks ancient forests","story":"Project to recreate ancient habitat prepares for delicate process of reuniting species On a summer’s day the spot is idyllic. Ancient English woodland tumbles towards the broad river valley. The birds sing, the squirrels scurry.Then suddenly the mood changes as a bear ambles mightily into sight among the oak trees. Another clambers up a towering ash and seems to take in the view down to the River Severn and and across towards the Forest of Dean.Soon these Eurasian brown bears will be joined by a pack of Eurasian grey wolves and the two species will coexist – hopefully peacefully – in this corner of northern Europe for the first time in more than 1,000 years.This is not an ambitious rewilding scheme but a project run by the Bristol Zoological Society to offer a glimpse into what ancient British woodland was like before humans cleared the forests to make room for homes and farms and exterminated some of the spectacular creatures that lived there.The sight of bears and wolves together in one large enclosure will thrill visitors to Bear Wood within Bristol zoo’s Wild Place project but it is also designed to be thought-provoking – why did our ancestors think it acceptable to wipe out the bear and wolf and could we live with them again in the future?Dr Christoph Schwitzer, the chief zoological officer, is pleased that even before next week’s public opening, Bear Wood is provoking such debate. The zoo is proud of its conservation projects that range from trying to bolster gorilla populations in central Africa to reintroducing white-clawed crayfish to the UK.Schwitzer believes there is also a good argument for reintroducing larger creatures such as lynx to remote areas such as the Scottish highlands. “That may be worth trying. A population of 300 or 400 lynx might be viable,” he said.But bears and wolves in England? “That’s a lot more tricky. There are a lot of factors you need to consider, the first being that we are a heavily populated country.” And human behaviour has not changed over the centuries. “People would still go out and kill them,” he said.The opinion is not just theoretical. When a bear nicknamed Bruno wandered into German in 2006 he lasted only seven weeks before being shot by hunters. “People were so scared of it they couldn’t live with it,” said Schwitzer.All of which makes Bear Wood a bittersweet sort of place.As well as wolves and bears, wolverines and lynx are to be found in Bear Wood. They are in separate enclosures so will not come face to face with the larger animals, though they will smell and hear them.The wolverine is a member of the mustelid family that includes badgers, weasels and otters. It too once roamed British woodland before disappearing, presumably hunted for its fur and meat. A handful of wolverine bones have been found in Britain, more than half of them in south-west England and south Wales.Lynx vanished after the wolverine as woodland was chopped down, and next it was the turn of the bear to disappear. Quite when native British bears became extinct is not known. Bears were a familiar sight in Roman and medieval times but they may have been imported.Introducing the bears and wolves to each other will be a delicate process. “You have to observe rules,” said Schwitzer. “You can’t just throw them in together.”At first the five wolves will be brought into a separate enclosure next to the large one where the four bears are currently roaming so the two species can get used to one another.When the keepers judge the time is right the wolves will be allowed into the joint enclosure, though they will be able to retreat without the bears following them if they feel the need.“Conflict arises around prey or offspring,” said Schwitzer. So they will fed separately. The three male bears are to be castrated and the five wolves are all males so there will be no breeding and so no young to fight over.The fact that the bears and wolves have a 10,000 sq metre wooded paddock to share should help. They can keep away from each other if they want and interact if the mood takes them.Scientists will also be interested to find out what impact they have on the woodland. “We’ll be able to see how they change the flora and fauna,” said Schwitzer. The squirrels are likely to flee and the bears may clear vegetation, allowing more light-loving plants into the woods. Different invertebrates may move in.It will also be interesting to see how the bears and wolves operate as summer gives way to autumn and winter. It is not clear whether the bears will dig themselves into a den and hibernate.Across the Severn wild boar live wild in the Forest of Dean after accidental and deliberate releases from farms, and a year ago beavers were released into a large pen in the forest as part of a project to alleviate flooding. Wild beavers have also returned to a river in Devon. They are unlikely to be joined any time soon by bears or wolves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd79ed6e0bba97ebb79ce836e59019567e6dd3e4/0_409_4373_2624/master/4373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ce7ad2545a91f68dc49da5e8d7e16fe","title":"eiderdown harvesting iceland eider duck","story":"In Iceland, the harvesting of these precious feathers has created a peculiar bond between human and duck. What can this unique relationship teach us? It is difficult to describe the weight of eiderdown in a language in which the epitome of lightness is a feather. Unlike a feather’s ordered barbs arranged around a solid shaft, under a microscope, eiderdown offers a portrait of chaos: hundreds of soft threads branch out from a single point, twisting around one another. Upon each thread are countless small hooks, which allow the down to cling to itself, trapping pockets of air and warmth.When I returned from Iceland, I asked my wife to close her eyes and put her hands out. After placing a duck-size clump of down in her hands, I asked her what she felt. “Heat,” she said. She opened her eyes to find the down, a ghostly grey form, hovering above her palms, and pulled it apart. It crackled as if electrified, emitting a mild smell that reminded me of burned hair. She scrunched her hands and the down disappeared in her fingers, compressed into a ball smaller than a duckling’s bill.Over centuries, eiderdown has been treasured by those who shared their lands with the eider. The Vikings apparently filled their bedding with it, while medieval tax collectors accepted it as a means of payment. Today, its buyers are the global super-rich. In Iceland, I heard stories about Gulf royals who sleep under eiderdown in the desert, and Russian politicians whose hearts can be warmed with the gift of an eiderdown duvet.The properties of eiderdown – extreme lightness and insulation – make sense when you consider the life of its owner. The eider is a fat seabird, more penguin than duck, and many of them spend most of their lives in the Arctic Circle. Visit the Icelandic coast and you will see hundreds bobbing gregariously in the sea. Brash creatures, their boldness inspires admiration in the Icelanders. “The eider is an unsung hero, far braver than any bird of prey, which it is known to attack to protect its offspring,” one local told me.The usual story of how feathers come to fill our bedding is anything but comforting. According to trade bodies, most feathers are a byproduct of the meat industry. Less fortunate birds may have their plumage ripped out while they are still alive, a practice known as live-plucking.As I held a clump of eiderdown in my hand, however, one Icelander told me something that seemed to offer an alternative to this unsettling relationship between humans and birds. He said that the eider it once belonged to is probably still alive. Not in some dark barn, or even in an open-air enclosure, but in the wilds of the Arctic Circle.In a cafe in Ísafjörður, the pastor explained how he harvests eiderdown. As part of his parish duties, he runs a small farm, a throwback to earlier times when pastors in remote areas would survive off the land. Every June, he said, about 500 ducks arrive from the sea and waddle to his farm. Eiders do not naturally nest in such large colonies, but will congregate close to human settlements to seek shelter and protection. The ducks nest anywhere: in tyres, doorways and even houses. “I always take a lot of flags with me and I put a flag beside each nest so I will be able to find it again. Because they are incredibly camouflaged, these ducks. You can almost step on them,” he said.At night, the pastor guards the flock of eiders from their predators: seagulls, foxes and mink. “I was quite lucky in that I got interested in guns when I was just a little over 20,” he said. “It was before I started studying theology.” If he were to fall asleep, a fox would have a feast of sitting ducks. “It’s more than a financial loss, it’s also like they are depending on me. So I don’t want to let them down. I used to be a night watchman, so I have a little bit of experience staying awake.”In the middle ages, pelicans were thought to pierce their own breast to draw blood to feed their young. The mythical act was known as vulning, a Christ-like act of self-sacrifice. On the pastor’s land, the eider, too, makes herself vulnerable for her offspring, although it is down, not blood, that she draws from her breast. From this down she builds a nest for her eggs her own bare skin, freshly revealed, covers them with warmth. She sits on her eggs for some 28 days, during which she may lose a third of her body weight some mothers starve to death.The scene described by the pastor has been a common sight in Iceland for centuries. Down has been collected here probably since the arrival of Norse settlers in the ninth century. The sight of thousands of tame eiders close to human settlements astounded early European travellers in Iceland. CW Shepherd, an Englishman who visited the island of Vigur in the Westfjords in 1862, described a farm besieged by eiders: “On the ground, the house was fringed with ducks. On the turf slopes of the roof, we could see ducks and a duck sat on the door-scraper … A windmill was infested and so were all the outhouses, mounds, rocks and crevices. The ducks were everywhere.”Environmentalists, economists and ornithologists have all fallen in love with Icelandic harvesting. There is an irresistible simplicity to the relationship between the harvesters and the eiders. If a harvester cares for the ducks, more and more will come to nest, increasing the amount of down that can be gathered.In myths, fables and hagiographies, one often reads of the ability of iniduals to tame wild creatures. It is said that St Cuthbert, the seventh-century missionary who settled on the Farne Islands off the Northumbrian coast, protected and tamed eiders. (Today in Northumberland, the eider is sometimes called St Cuthbert’s or Cuddy duck.) Many of these stories were built upon embellishment or pure fantasy, but in Iceland, travellers’ accounts repeatedly confirmed the existence of this strange relationship between Icelanders and the ducks.I wanted to know how this relationship worked, how it was possible for a wild bird to behave as if it were domesticated. How did this strange tradition come about? How was it that the relationship had been preserved despite the arrival of the market? Could eiderdown harvesting teach us about our relationship with other species?Back in Ísafjörður, the pastor told me about a Japanese film crew who had made a documentary about him. For several weeks, they followed him around his farm, recording him collecting down with his children, while sidestepping nesting eiders. He appeared bemused by their attention, just as he was by mine. After all, he said, the down was only some brauð, a slice of his daily bread.The pastor’s parish lay a short drive from Ísafjörður in another fjord, Önundarfjörður. It was once reached via a winding mountain road but, since 1996, the two fjords have been connected by a vast tunnel that bores directly through the hillside. One morning, I emerged from its confines, blinded by the subarctic light, and headed to the pastor’s church to take a tour of his nesting area.Like many Lutheran parishes, the pastor’s land is among the most prized in the Westfjords. In the shadow of a steep glacial wall, his family home and church overlook a floodplain that leads to the shoreline. It was hard to conceive of a more peaceful spot for a family, yet there was an air of abandonment to the pastor’s home. Children’s toys lay scattered around on the floor and a layer of dust covered the work surfaces. The previous winter, he explained, the weather had got so bad that he and his family had to leave the parish and take an apartment in Ísafjörður. He now rarely spends any time in the house. “We were trapped here for 36 hours with no electricity, no phone,” he said. “I can’t be responsible for that.”I was late for the eiderdown season, but the pastor offered to lead me around the land and re-enact his summer ritual as he had done for the Japanese film crew. Dressed in an old Polish military uniform, he headed off across the flat plain towards the beach, hunting for any nests that he had missed. It was a still day, the silence broken only by the call of an oystercatcher, alarmed by our presence.Walking on this flat land, I felt as if I had missed out on a great gathering. All around us were hundreds of small piles of crushed mussel shells, the remnants of the eiders’ feasting, ground up by their powerful gizzards. Quartz-like, these remains had an understated beauty, glinting in the light. “In the later part, everything is going crazy,” the pastor said. “Birds and chicks running around. Arctic terns attacking all the time. It’s good to have a broomstick.”Later, as we made our way back to the church, the pastor let out a cry and pointed to a nest that he had missed during the previous gathering. Covered in moss, grass and broken eggs, it looked like a furry grey omelette or pancake. He wedged his stick under the down, easing it gently from the grass, and picked it up. Laden with seaweed, twigs and dirt, it reminded me of the contents of a vacuum cleaner, half fluff, half debris. Unlike the clean down my wife had held, it had a pungent, mouldy aroma, suggestive of the sitting duck from which it came. Looking closely, I saw the remains of several eggs caught up in the down. Rendered rubbery by rainfall, their fragments were proof of what the pastor had said he always allowed the ducklings to hatch before collecting their bedding. “Take it as a gift,” he said.Some 50 years before I visited Iceland, the Scottish writer Gavin Maxwell became momentarily possessed by Icelandic harvesting while living in Sandaig, a bay in remote western Scotland. He began to read about it and even travelled to Iceland on a research trip. Maxwell is best known for for his memoir Ring of Bright Water, which recounts his domestic life with several otters, but he also adored eiders. “Perhaps,” he mused, “it is their peculiarly uneven voices, or the way their massive bills ascend in a straight line to the top of their skulls without any ‘scoop’ in between. Or perhaps it is their curious and very inidual smell, which seems as if it could have nothing to do with a bird.”Unlike previous travel writers who described eiderdown, he dreamed of recreating the success of the Icelanders. From his cottage, he had noticed eiders nesting on a small island close to his home he counted only 30 pairs in total, but he imagined that he might turn it into a magnet for ducks. Inspired by Icelandic methods, he proposed erecting flags, wind propellers, scarecrows, artificial nesting sites, wind shelters and decoy drake eiders to attract the ducks. He concocted plans to feed the ducks with mussels and – apparently – even to entertain them with music.Maxwell wrote of harvesting in utopian terms, describing how early settlers had lured eiders with “an elaboration of fluttering flags, little wind-driven clacking propellers, and reeded wind instruments that would sigh, groan or trumpet, according to the strength of the breeze”. The Icelanders, he believed, had some sort of special ability to understand ducks that verged on the mystical. While he took copious notes on Icelandic techniques in an attempt to understand their success, he allowed that there was “a certain mystique” about the practice. “Some men,” he wrote, “seem to have ‘green fingers’ with Eiders.”When I visited the pastor, I was infused with Maxwell’s own vision of down, a contrast to stories of degradation and exploitation. Patient and sensitive, the pastor seemed to fit perfectly Maxwell’s vision, heroically guarding the ducks, never taking the down too early. And yet something didn’t feel quite right. In the 19th century, British, French, Scandinavian and American travellers, many of them scientists, started visiting Iceland, which was then a Danish colony. Wandering through its volcanic landscape, admiring the frames of its miniature horses and its colossal populations of eiders, or listening to the Icelandic tongue, they described Iceland in magical terms. Fed up with their descriptions of “scenes of thrilling horror, of majestic grandeur, and of heavenly beauty”, the explorer Richard Burton wrote of a condition called “Iceland on the brain”. I feared that I was falling into a similar trap, failing to write about another character in the drama.The Arctic fox – Vulpes lagopus – is the only mammal in Iceland whose presence predates the island’s settlement. Much smaller than its red cousin, the Arctic fox has miniature soft paws that are entirely covered in fur (hence its species name, which means “rabbit foot” in Latin). Perfectly adapted to the country’s varying seasons, the foxes can roam thousands of kilometres, their winter coats transforming from white to brown or even blue in the summer months.When settlers arrived with domestic animals, it was inevitable that they would clash with the Arctic fox. Fearful of the threat to livestock, farmers clubbed, trapped and later poisoned and shot them. Such was the fear of the foxes among Icelanders that a myth emerged that they had been sent by the king of Norway to punish settlers for their abandonment of their motherland. Legislation to encourage their extermination dates back to 1295, and even today each community in Iceland is obliged to hire a fox killer to visit all known dens in the area to exterminate their occupants.As I drove back from the pastor’s farm to Ísafjörður, it struck me as unlikely that the pastor, this kind man who refused to disturb an eider, was a true fox killer. Despite the military uniform, glasses and talk of guns, he never actually described killing a fox. I later asked his friend and neighbour, a long-time eider farmer, who really kills the foxes in the fjord. “I do,” he said with a smile. “The priest has never shot a single fox.”I wondered whether I had not experienced a sanitised version of down harvesting, one primed for the Japanese market. I asked around in the Westfjords, searching for the name of an effective fox killer. Again and again the same name popped up: Valdimar Gíslason. Famed throughout the Westfjords for his cunning and ruthlessness, he had raised a private army, a band of killers to protect their capital of eider ducks. Eider farmers spoke of him in hushed tones, revering him for his dedication to fox extermination.Gíslason lived in Dýrafjörður, the fjord beyond the pastor. The following week I visited him at his home, a sparsely furnished farmhouse that overlooked the fjord. His Danish wife, Edda, welcomed me in, the sound of choir music blending with the roar of an eiderdown dryer in a barn outside. A retired maths teacher, Gíslason has lived in the fjord for seven decades. Since his boyhood, he has gathered eiderdown from his land and pursued the foxes that wish to dine on his ducks. “Sixty-five years, 50 nights every spring,” he said, as if considering a mathematical problem. After so many nights of shooting, his hearing had begun to fade.The practice of poisoning or sedating eiders’ predators was once widespread in Iceland, carried out by farmers and government officials alike. Such techniques may have saved the lives of countless ducks, but they have historically proved highly destructive to the island’s ecosystem. In the early 1980s, for example, more than 4,000 ravens were killed per year under the country’s pest control programme. Worse, the disappearance of Iceland’s white-tailed eagle, which almost went extinct in the 1960s, has been attributed partly to the activities of eiderdown farmers. Although eagle numbers have now recovered, their torrid history speaks of what Andri Snær Magnason, himself an eiderdown farmer, calls the “dark side” of the eiderdown trade: however virtuous harvesters may be, they have a strong incentive to kill any species that threatens the prized bird.But there was another reason that explained Gíslason’s fondness for foxes, one I appreciated only once he brought out his notebook. Bound in red leather, it recorded the number of ducks that had come to his farm over five decades. In the early 1960s, it recorded more than 6,000 ducks, but gradually the figure began to decline. Today, Gíslason said, there are only 1,500 nests. I guessed that the foxes were to blame, but he replied that the fox was innocent it was his neighbours, his fellow hunters, who had reduced his take of eiderdown.When settlers first came to Iceland from Norway, fleeing political turmoil, they were confronted with a harsh subarctic landscape, devoid of large animals. As well as bringing their own domesticated animals and crops, settlers foraged along the island’s coastline for driftwood, molluscs, edible plants, eiderdown and beached whales. Such a windfall offered opportunities, but also potential for great conflict. Indeed, much of early Icelandic law deals specifically with harvesting rights for these scarce resources in order to avoid violence.The sagas piled on Gíslason’s shelf, those bloody tales of Iceland’s settlement period, recount how huge disputes would erupt between settlers over driftage rights, particularly over beached whales. Like the beached whale, the ducks in Gíslason’s fjord were a finite and highly valued resource any gain by a farmer in eiderdown would be offset by another’s loss. Yet it was impossible to conceive of any conflict over their down, to conjure a scene in which they ran towards the nests, turning their rifles on each other or making missiles of eider eggs. The fox had masked the competitive logic of the harvest, uniting the farmers in common cause, their quest to avert a duck massacre.I did not sense any cruelty in any of the harvesters I met, merely the simple, unsentimental coldness of a people who lived off the land, who killed or starved. All this said, part of me still preferred Maxwell’s version, his image of Icelanders with “green fingers”. Walking through the Hornstrandir reserve, the most remote area of the Westfjords, I would often see Arctic foxes patrolling the banks of rivers or the coastline, looking for birds and eggs. At night, I would listen to their high-pitched calls from my tent, my dreams populated with images of small children at play. Like the birch trees that once covered Iceland, the foxes were a reminder of what this island was like before the arrival of human settlers. To kill them was to assert a certain logic that felt at odds with the promise of eiderdown, its essential balance, and I began to hunt for places in the Westfjords that might fit Maxwell’s image.In writings on eiderdown, Æðey, a tiny island in the Westfjords peninsula, has assumed an almost pre-eminent status among nesting sites because of the vast size of its eider population. In the summer months, thousands upon thousands of eiders besiege the island, coating its grassland in brown and white hues, the sound of cooing drakes almost deafening the visitor.It took me some five hours by car to reach the pick-up point to Æðey. A mere 15 miles (24km) of water separates it from Ísafjörður, but the coastal roads of the Westfjords wind like furled ribbons, tracing the outlines of the fjords’ fingers. Driving along them, you seem to brush your destination, only to fold back on yourself, and repeat the process.From the pick-up point, I stepped on to a small boat belonging to Alexíus Jónasson, one of Æðey’s owners. In his mid-30s, Alexíus spoke perfect English, honed from years of reading Tolkien, Clancy and the instruction manuals for fish-processing machinery from his workplace in Ísafjörður. The sixth of seven generations who have lived on Æðey, he gathers down together with his two brothers, Jonás and Magnús. But Alexíus told me that it is their mother, Katrín, who is really in charge of the down harvest, a reminder of the key role that women and family matriarchs have traditionally played in the trade, from nest to bedding.Handling the boat with expert care, Alexíus guided us across the narrow stretch of water, scattering the seabirds on its surface. As we approached the island, I could hear the cries of his children playing in the water under the gaze of his mother. “It’s nice for them to be free,” Alexíus said, before we heard a high-pitched wail. “We get the occasional argument.”I followed Alexíus as he wandered across the island. We headed onwards to the island’s lighthouse, studiously avoiding puffin nests in the fissures that riddle the island. At the island’s tip we sat down on a rock, admiring the spouts of several humpbacks, there to feed in Iceland’s rich waters after journeying from their breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico.Watching the whales’ spouts rise and dissolve in the distance, it was easy to believe this place a rural utopia, a place where eiders could nest in peace and children roamed alongside geese, rabbits, puffins and horses. Around us life exploded from the water, the skies and the crevices in the rocks. All one had to do was to observe it, wait patiently and gather eiderdown. But then we were met by Tása, the family dog, whose job it was to catch any mink that swim over from the mainland. “She’s a gentle family dog,” Alexíus said, “but when she meets the mink she goes apeshit. It’s quite messy when she gets it. She starts one end and breaks every bone.”The recent history of the Westfjords is really the story of rural depopulation, of a vanishing culture next to the Arctic Circle. Over the past decade, countless farmers have packed up and left the region, tired of the weather, isolation and poor roads. The region’s tunnels and bridges, intended to increase mobility, have served as escape routes, emptying the fjords of Icelanders. “The government is always making it harder for people,” Magnús said. “There’s so little money in it, being a farmer, it’s becoming a lifestyle choice.”Unlike many livestock farms in the Westfjords, eider farms are still populated, their down a source of stable income. Faced with rising costs and falling profits, the brothers stopped sheep-farming in 1990. Instead, they chose to specialise in eiderdown. “It’s like a family thing,” Alexíus said. “Everybody helps out.”While the Icelanders manage the eiders, drawing them to their dwellings with the promise of protection, the ducks had also bound the farmers to these remote corners. “It’s like the ducks are keeping us here,” Magnús told me. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.”Yet there was another presence, one that silently haunted the harvesters’ imaginations, fed by novels or television: the men and women of ambition who wore the jackets or slept under the duvets. Unlike Icelandic wool sweaters, yoghurt or finance, eiderdown has, for much of its history, been an international commodity, first traded by the Danes, then – after Iceland’s independence – bought by middlemen in Europe and Japan. Far from isolated, Iceland’s 350 eider farms are connected to distant metropolises, with an invisible thread running between the ducks, the harvesters and the buyers, much of whose wealth, no doubt, is built on a form of resource extraction that is far removed from the gentle rhythms of down-gathering.In many remote communities, cut off from urban centres by the harsh contours of landscape, stretches of water or walls of rock, encountering the global market has been a source of trauma, leading to a collapse in the old ways of living and seeing. But I felt no quake on Æðey or indeed on any of the other eider farms I visited. Every season, the ducks came, and their down was harvested and shipped off to the middlemen for a stable price, much as has been done for centuries. And yet there were signs, too, that things might be changing, as Iceland continues to be shaken by the effects of the financial crisis, the influx of millions of tourists and rural depopulation. Like the sheep farmers, the eiderdown harvesters were getting fed up with the harsh weather and isolation. Many eiderdown farms, said Jón Sveinsson, another harvester, are merely summer houses, places of recreation for city dwellers. “The new owners are not interested in the pittance a few kilograms of eiderdown give. After all, they have come to the countryside to have a beer on the porch, fire up the grill and relax on the weekend, not to run around harvesting foul-smelling, flea-ridden eiderdown.”I tried to imagine what the Westfjords might look like in 50 years or so, as old ways of life faded away. “It’s not sad,” Sveinsson told me, “just different. The world is getting smaller.” But I did feel sad, thinking that this tradition might disappear. When I returned to the UK, I made a habit of checking in department stores to see if they had eiderdown quilts or pillows. Finding them in a shop window, I always felt reassured that the traffic in down continued, that this tradition still had a place in our own century of synthetics and factory farming. Nestled in silk covers, the down was always hidden from view, its rich history condensed into a short description on the label. Tempted by an act of mischief, I almost wanted to rip them apart, allowing the down and its stories to expand and escape outward.Adapted from Harvest: The Hidden Histories of Seven Natural Objects by Edward Posnett, published by The Bodley Head on 8 August and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e19fd01b1d26d8845b7a558fdaf70e876f2a9fa1/0_269_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7d6169ba964946c7d6e9fdb68d3354d","title":"in praise of the things that cost nothing","story":"There is plenty to enjoy that is free in a world where it seems everything has a costWhat do blackberries, beaches, bike rides – and this newsletter – all have in common?That’s right: they are free, gratis, kostenlos.

Some 30 per cent of 2016 graduates from further education progress to higher education, while 38 per cent were re-enrolled in another further education course within a year.The study also shows employment prospects for apprenticeships have improved significantly over recent years.While more than half of apprentices qualified in 2010 were in employment two years after qualification, this rose to 80 per cent for apprentices qualified in 2014.Paul O’Toole, the Higher Education Authority’s chief executive, said the study provided “invaluable information” on what graduates do after leaving college.He said it will allow stakeholders in higher education to build a “strong and objective evidence-base for policymaking and delivery of a high-quality higher-education system”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Listening to music has similar effects to sedative offered to deal with nerves - studyIarnr\u0026oacuted \u0026Eacuteireann closing both centre stations to allow for repairs on Pearse Street roofCustoms officers find 35kgs of cocaine and arrest man in his 40sPhotograph of \u0026lsquoAngela Merkel Thinks We\u0026rsquore at Work\u0026rsquo flag went viralDundalk woman and daughter in displacement camp in SyriaSpouses of Irish citizens based in the North will not be able to leave jurisdiction for a yearHurling and uilleann piping also included in list of cultural activities unique to IrelandVytas Lemnickis (45) died by suicide within four hours of being admittedSecond man injured in incident on North StrandA fourth man who said he had left group before murders gets life sentenceTemperatures will reach 22 degrees on SundayThe driver of the car involved in the collision was uninjuredHSE does not recognise PNA for ambulance personnelStudy tracks earnings of hundreds of thousands of graduates via PAYE system\u0026lsquoIs it not evident that the world needs trees more than ever?

She moved to Syria, via Tunisia, in 2015 shortly after leaving the Air Corps where she worked as a flight attendant on the Government jet and as a driver to senior officers. She served for a time with the Army as part of the 27th Infantry Battalion.Speaking on the sidelines of an EU meeting of justice ministers in Helsinki, Finland, Mr Flanagan said the Government is unlikely to send any Irish personnel to Syria to bring Ms Smith back due to the dangers they might face.“I am most reluctant to comment on any inidual consular case. But what I will say is that there are unique circumstances attached to this particular case insofar as the terrain is concerned,” Mr Flanagan told The .“It’s a real challenge for Irish officials or people acting on behalf of the Irish state to enter one of the most challenging areas of conflict in the world.”The Minister said Ireland is “engaging with international actors in order to offer assistance” but declined to give more detail. It is the first official confirmation the Government is relying on external parties to help bring Ms Smith and her child to Ireland.The Government previously rejected a plan from the Defence Forces to bring her home from Syria two months ago through co-operation with foreign intelligence agencies.The plan, which was drawn up by the Directorate of Military Intelligence, also known as J2, was presented to Minister of State for Defence Paul Kehoe in late April.It would have involved her being removed from the camp and sent south to the Jordanian border and to safety.It has also previously been reported that the Government has asked for assistance from the International Red Cross in bringing Ms Smith and her daughter from Syria to Turkey where she would be met by Irish officials.Although declining to comment on inidual cases, Mr Flanagan indicated Ms Smith will be interviewed by gardaí immediately on her arrival in Ireland and may have to undergo a deradicalisation process.“With people coming from that region to Ireland, arriving in Ireland, it’s important there are be interviews, welfare arrangements and also a process of deradicalisation if appropriate.”He insisted no new legislation is needed to specifically prevent people from travelling to Syria or Iraq to join extremist groups.This week Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and several politicians from Ms Smith’s home county of Louth said she should be allowed return.In her latest media interview at the Al Hawl refugee camp near the Turkish border where she is being detained, Ms Smith said said she does not think she will be allowed to return to Ireland.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke radio programme he wanted to see Ms Smith and her two-year-old child, an Irish citizen, return to Ireland. “I want her child to be able to come home. I would never separate a mother and child,” he said.Asked about difficulties associated with returning Ms Smith to Ireland, Mr Varadkar declined to comment on “military operations” but said the Government did not want to put any personnel at risk."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3960854.1563478586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is it financially worth going to college new data says yes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGraduates with a PhD or doctoral degree earned the most within a year of qualification (€710 per week), followed by master’s (€560), honours degree (€475), ordinary degree (€380) and advanced certificate (€285).Going to college is a costly business.

And the higher your level of qualification, the higher your earnings premium.For example, graduates with a PhD or doctoral degree earned the most within a year of qualification (€710 per week), followed by master’s (€560), honours degree (€475), ordinary degree (€380) and advanced certificate (€285).However, it may be questionable whether lower levels of qualifications – such as advanced certificates, also known as level-six courses – are really worth the cost.It’s of little surprise to find that earnings vary significantly for graduates depending on the type of course they completed.Over recent years, education graduates have tended to earn most in the first year after college, followed by health and welfare. They also have the highest proportions of graduates in work.Tech and engineeringHowever, the slower rate of salary increase in these sectors means they are quickly outstripped by graduates from areas such as tech and engineering.Within five years of leaving college, for example, information and communication technology graduates were the highest earners (on €815 a week), followed by engineering (€730), health and welfare (€710), science (€705), education (€695) and businesslaw (€685).By contrast, the lowest earners had qualifications in services (€530 a week), arts and humanities (€585), agriculture and veterinary (€610), and social sciences and journalism (€645).Despite high earnings on offer in the sector, many tech firms say they are facing acute skills shortages and relatively few school-leavers are choosing courses in this area.In fact, the most popular industries for new graduates in 2016 were wholesale and retail, followed by health, science and education.While the figures show there is an earnings premium for the highest levels of qualification, the proportion of students opting to complete postgraduate studies is falling.While about one in four graduates re-enrolled in higher education in 2016, this is down from one in three in 2010.This is most likely a result of the improved job opportunities in the workplace. In many sectors, graduates are being hired before they leave college. By contrast, during the recession when jobs were scarcer, a postgraduate course was often seem as a way of riding out the economic storm.Median earningsAlmost 80 per cent of 2016 graduates were in employment in the first year after graduation, compared to 65 per cent of 2010.Graduates are also earning more, with weekly median earnings for 2016 graduates at €475 a week, compared to €420 in 2010.This latest study also examined outcomes for graduates of further education and apprenticeships.It is hard to neatly compare these with the higher education figures, as they don’t include earnings.However, they do show that, for many, the further education sector is a stepping stone to further study.Some 30 per cent of 2016 graduates from further education progressed to higher education, while 38 per cent were re-enrolled in another further education course within a year.The study also shows employment prospects for apprenticeships have improved significantly over recent years.While more than half of apprentices who qualified in 2010 were in employment two years after qualification, this rose to 80 per cent for apprentices qualified in 2014.It would be interesting to compare their earnings to college graduates, but we don’t have that data.

Photograph:John MacDougallGettyGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that if Brexit negotiations found a solution for the Border issue in the declaration on future ties between Britain and the European Union, the so-called backstop would effectively be overwritten. The backstop, which ensures the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland stays open after Brexit, is contested by leading British politicians who want it changed or scrapped. It requires Britain to adopt some EU rules unless a future arrangement is found during negotiations after Brexit, now set for October. The Border will be Britain’s only land border with the European Union after Brexit. “The Withdrawal Agreement is the Withdrawal Agreement,” Ms Merkel told a news conference. “But the moment that a solution for the management of the Border is found in (the declaration on) the future relationship... then the backstop will be overwritten, so to speak.” Ms Merkel added: “This means the task is to draft future relations that way and perhaps to draft them more specifically and better and more precisely than so far.” Then there is scope to come to an agreement and determine future relations, she added. Opposition to the backstop within Britain’s deeply ided parliament was one of the key reasons outgoing prime minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement deal was rejected three times by MPs - losses that ultimately forced her to resign. Eliminating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and providing frictionless trade was a crucial part of the 1998 Belfast Agreement. - ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

making it the longest-standing car club in the area. Describing itself as a modified car club, drivers descend upon a nominated area and park up. Usually in a car park after the businesses have closed for the day, the car owners will showcase the modifications made to their vehicles. From beefing up their engines to bolstering the car\u0027s sound systems and from changing the car\u0027s shape with a body kit to installing neon lights - the idea is for drivers to be able to display their cars for enthusiasts to admire. Those attending events are invited to walk around the cars, buy merchandise, share advice and plan further meet-ups.But, with adrenaline running, high-powered cars and the lure of likes on social media, Thursday night\u0027s event turned rogue. Despite organiser Nix Sidhu pleading with participants not to race - the message did not get through. He said: We held the meet in a car park with a speed bump at the entrance. But unfortunately some people went a bit rogue.We try and stop that, we urge people - urge them on social media beforehand - not to go out on the roads, not to risk injury or anything.But unfortunately, in this age of social media and Snapchat, people want to get footage and post things to their friends, which seems to drive some people to the main road.Video footage dedicated to the event - but not posted by Cruise-Herts - shows dozens of cars arriving. The roar from the exhausts accentuate the firepower under the bonnets of the modified cars. It is daylight when the cars arrive to find their space in the car parks so that fellow enthusiasts can ogle their vehicles. But the trouble comes when these cars leave the retail car park and join the dual carriageway. It appears to be a crowd-pleaser, with people lining the streets to hear the cars screech back onto the public road, the drivers flexing their vehicle\u0027s muscles. As the night draws in and cars pile out, the more people can be seen on the grass bank adjacent to the road as well as the central reservation.A video recorded on June 27 shows a police car parked around 100 yards down the road from the junction. This is the same junction where the two cars collided on Thursday.Enthusiasts cheer loudly as the cars pull away into the darkness, like sport stars getting a standing ovation leaving the field after a victory. On the evening of June 27, officers were filmed pulling a driver over having flashed the blue lights. Mr Sidhu said the event had been running regularly for 17 years, providing a safe space for car enthusiasts to meet within a controlled, closed environment.He added: We have a liaison officer to pass number plates to police if there is ever any trouble we try to make it as safe as possible.Some people like drinking and that sort of thing, we just like cars. They are our pride and joy, what we are interested in.Unfortunately this incident means we are all going to be tarred with the same brush - people will say we are boy racers.We are devastated. I\u0027ve been running this for 10 years and we have never had one incident. We were raising money for charity, as we often do, and there was no speed element to it.The meetings were well established - offering enthusiasts the chance to buy Cruise-Herts hoodies, banners and stickers. They were also raising money for charity and Thursday\u0027s event was dedicated to 4Louis, who provide equipment and training free of charge to hospital units, hospices and other professionals who sadly have the job of comforting grieving families who suffer a miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal or child death. As well as the weekly meetings, Cruise-Herts also put on convoys, where drivers would meet at a specific place in Hertfordshire before travelling en masse to a bigger meet.The most recent was in May, when the fleet travelled to London for the Car Culture UK Final Meet.Almost 2,000 attended from across the country to display their vehicles at the car park of Pets At Home in Newham. But, as video footage from the meet shows, it turned into hundreds of people gathered around cars wheel-spinning and drifting on the tarmac. \u0026#39The desperation on the Remain side knows no limits\u0026#39-  readers react to this week\u0026#39s top storiesTory leadership latest: Philip Hammond and rebels hint they could bring down government in the \u0026#39interests of the country\u0026#39New European Commission president forswears her dream of United States of EuropeIlhan Omar arrives home to hero\u0026#39s welcome after days of feuding with President TrumpChina cancels Prague orchestra tour amid Taiwan row with mayorStephen Nicholson jailed for life for rape and murder of Lucy McHughExtinction Rebellion boats banned from London by Met PoliceBritain\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to graduate salary revealedTrump\u0026#39s racism is a return to America\u0026#39s old nativist argumentsSign up to The Take newsletter: your guide to the latest news and topics taking over your feedDutch airline investigates homophobic email in wake of breastfeeding rowIran claims US shot down its own drone by mistakeJapan in shock after \u0026#39brightest and best\u0026#39 of anime killed in arson attack by man claiming his idea was \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39Malaysian police say opposition leader behind gay sex tape allegations leveled at future PMA quarter of police forces have just one or fewer women in their top ranks, figures show\u0026#39Millions\u0026#39 of Painted Lady butterflies set to arrive in the UK this summerStevenage crash: 17 injured at modified car club meet as vehicles plough into crowd after \u0026#39reckless doughnut manoeuvre\u0026#39Schoolgirl\u0026#39s murder trial hampered after care worker refused to hand over Facebook password Breathalysers could be fitted inside the vehicles of convicted drink- driversJeremy Hunt angers whips after claiming he was told he could skip no-deal Brexit voteWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ilhan omar arrives home heros welcome days feuding president","story":"Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar arrived to her home state of Minnesota on July 18, to a cheering crowd at the airport chanting, “Welcome home Ilhan.”The warm welcome came the day after President Donald Trump supporters chanted “send her back” in reference to Omar at a campaign rally in North Carolina.Omar, who was born in Somalia, is one of four newly elected Democratic congresswomen to repeatedly clash with the President.

And it remains so unbelievable in part because it was also the end of the most significant part of the space race, with space travel soon after never ascending to such heights or levels of interest again.Here is the facts about that Apollo 11 Moon landing, including when and how humanity managed such an accomplishment – as well as why.The three astronauts in Apollo 11 set off on 16 July, 1969. After flying for three days, they entered lunar orbit, and on 20 July, Neil Armstrong stepped out of the lander and became the first person to ever walk on the Moon.After more than eight days in space, they dropped down on Earth and were hailed as heroes.Created with Sketch.

No human has ventured there – or even outside of low-Earth orbit – since.With great difficulty. Which in turn was overcome by hard work and ingenuity, as part of\u0026nbspthe culmination of thousands of years of human curiosity.Why some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThe Moon is, obviously, a long way away: about 250,000 miles. And getting there also means leaving Earth’s powerful gravity, which is just as difficult, pulling anything down and requiring vast power.That power came in the form of the Saturn V rocket, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever made, and arguably the most mighty piece of machinery that humanity has ever put together.On top sat the three astronauts, in a much smaller capsule. The rocket carried the astronauts up into space, but it was this capsule that would carry them to the Moon and back, once they had managed to escape Earth.That capsule, known as the command service module, was actually made up of three parts: the command module, that served as the astronauts’\u0026nbsphome through the mission, the service module that contained the bits that powered them through space and kept them alive, and the lunar module.It was only that latter part that ever made its way to the Moon’s surface, after detaching from the rest and touching down on the ground. After Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had explored the Moon, they climbed back into the ascent stage part of that lunar module and used it to fly back up and attach to the main craft, which was being piloted by their colleague Michael Collins.They would then gradually float back to Earth, crashing down to land and completing their mission successfully.There was never any one justification for heading to the Moon. And many people thought we should head there for no reason at all – just because we can, and therefore should.But there was another pressing reason: because other people could. The Moon landing was the crescendo of the Space Race, which had seen the US battle with the Soviet space programme to get to a range of different milestones.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionWhy some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThat didn’t start with the Moon. Both countries – embroiled at the same time in the Cold War – flung rockets, satellites, animals and people into space to demonstrate their power, and putting a man on the Moon became the inevitable conclusion of that work.All of those various aims and desires came wrapped together in a speech given by John F Kennedy in 1961, which helped launch the race for the Moon and set down the reasons for doing so.“I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth,” he said.\u0026nbsp”No single space project in this period will be more exciting, or more impressive, or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.”Getting there helped improve science in myriad ways. A variety of breakthroughs came as a result of the work done to get humanity to the Moon, and when the astronauts touched down they also helped with scientific work in unprecedented ways – they gathered up Moon rocks, left behind sensors, and even the ways that their bodies responded to the stress and strangeness of space was studied to give information that is still being studied to this day.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,” Mr Khan said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“Unlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords has more than doubled from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricwaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent. Across England, lower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof boroughs need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two0bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain forms they can benefit certain groups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco found that some landlords converted their properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new-builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbsp improve dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it were on the moon it would simply droop. The truth is that it is not waving, rather it is being held in place by a telescopic pole running through the top of the flag and it is crumpled as it had been screwed up for days en route to the moon28 Boot doesn\u0027t match the boot printIt is suggested that this picture of a boot print on the moon is fake because it does not line up with the tread of this boot from Neil Armstrong\u0027s spacesuit. That\u0027s right, it doesn\u0027t.38 Boot doesn\u0027t match the boot printThe print does however match that of the outer boots, the ones worn by the Apollo crew when walking on the moon. And while we\u0027re at it: the print is from Buzz Aldrin not Armstrong.48 No stars in outer space?Why are there no stars in sight when this picture was taken on a rock in outer space that has no atmosphere? Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time. This means that the camera will not take in the light of the distant stars, only that of the much nearer, brighter sun.58 Astronauts couldn\u0027t survive the radiation beltsThe Van Allen belts are regions of extremely high energy charged particles are trapped in the earth\u0027s magnetic field.

If you’ve ever done firewalking, you’ll know the one thing you don’t do is linger around in the middle of the firepit. You cross as quickly as you can... as long as you walk across quite quickly, looking at the thermal conductivity of your feet, you are not going to have enough thermal energy going into the soles of your feet to burn you. You’re absolutely fine. Just don’t hang around in the middle!78 Shadows aren\u0027t parallel - must be a lighting set-upThese two shadows are pointing in separate directions, hence they must be lit by two separate lights in a studio set-up rather than the single-point source of the sun. 88 Shadows aren\u0027t parallel - must be a lighting set-upNo, this is simply a matter of perspective. The moon\u0027s surface is not flat and so the shadows are not projected perfectly parallel. This question would have never been asked if we could see the beginning of the shadows, which would all align with the same vanishing point.18 Flag waves but there is no wind on the moonThe theory goes that as the flag is waving in the wind, it must have been on earth as there is no wind on the moon. If it were on the moon it would simply droop. The truth is that it is not waving, rather it is being held in place by a telescopic pole running through the top of the flag and it is crumpled as it had been screwed up for days en route to the moon28 Boot doesn\u0027t match the boot printIt is suggested that this picture of a boot print on the moon is fake because it does not line up with the tread of this boot from Neil Armstrong\u0027s spacesuit. That\u0027s right, it doesn\u0027t.38 Boot doesn\u0027t match the boot printThe print does however match that of the outer boots, the ones worn by the Apollo crew when walking on the moon. And while we\u0027re at it: the print is from Buzz Aldrin not Armstrong.48 No stars in outer space?Why are there no stars in sight when this picture was taken on a rock in outer space that has no atmosphere? Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time. This means that the camera will not take in the light of the distant stars, only that of the much nearer, brighter sun.58 Astronauts couldn\u0027t survive the radiation beltsThe Van Allen belts are regions of extremely high energy charged particles are trapped in the earth\u0027s magnetic field. The conspiracy theory goes that the astronauts could not possibly survive exposure to this level of radiation.68 Astronauts couldn\u0027t survive the radiation beltsProfessor Anu Ojha of the National Space Centre answers: Firewalking. If you’ve ever done firewalking, you’ll know the one thing you don’t do is linger around in the middle of the firepit. You cross as quickly as you can... as long as you walk across quite quickly, looking at the thermal conductivity of your feet, you are not going to have enough thermal energy going into the soles of your feet to burn you. You’re absolutely fine. Just don’t hang around in the middle!78 Shadows aren\u0027t parallel - must be a lighting set-upThese two shadows are pointing in separate directions, hence they must be lit by two separate lights in a studio set-up rather than the single-point source of the sun. 88 Shadows aren\u0027t parallel - must be a lighting set-upNo, this is simply a matter of perspective.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4547 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4647 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4747 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 147 Baldness cure looks to be a step closerResearchers in the US claim to have overcome one of the major hurdles to cultivating human follicles from stem cells.

The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4647 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4747 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. The other half received a 1-2mg dose of midazolam, before the nerve block was applied as normal (the sedative hits\u0026nbsppeak effectiveness at three minutes).While the study, published in the journal Regional Anaesthesia \u0026amp Pain Medicine, did reveal a greater anxiety reduction in the midazolam group, the difference was not statistically significant.The researchers said that allowing patients to listen to the music for longer, or choose their own music, could improve the results.“Music medicine offers an alternative to intravenous midazolam prior to single-injection peripheral nerve block procedures,” the authors said, adding that further research was\u0026nbspneeded to validate the findings.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Instagram seems unlikely to reverse its decision and may even roll it out to even more locations.\u0026nbspWho is affected and why did Instagram do it?Instagram first began trialling the feature in Canada earlier this year, saying it wanted people to worry a little bit less about how many likes they\u0027re getting.The trial has now extended to Australia, Brazil, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand, meaning all users in those countries will no longer be able to see the number of likes and video views a post receives.Senator accuses Facebook of ‘flagrant displays of bulls***\u0027We want your friends to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get, Instagram wrote in a post.The move comes in response to various studies that have found a link between mental health issues and the pressures brought about by social media use.Can you still find out who liked a post?Instagram says the feature is mandatory for all account holders in the seven countries, but even those users will have ways of seeing who likes their own posts.The firm explained: You can still see your own likes by tapping on the list of people who\u0027ve liked it, but your friends will not be able to see how many likes your post has received.arttributed to use of their platforms (Getty Images)If you are not in one of the affected countries, then it is still possible to see the number of likes posts receive from users within those countries.Also, Instagram says it does not mean the era of influencers is over, nor that brands and companies should worry about customer engagement.For businesses and creators on Instagram, this test will not affect measurement tools like Insights or Ads Manager, a spokesperson said.Will the feature spread to other countries?Key markets for Instagram, like the UK and US, remain unaffected but the spread may appear ominous to users in these countries.Despite the trial extending beyond Canada to six other countries, Instagram refuses to confirm the feature is permanent or that it will roll out further.Instead, Instagram said hiding the likes and video views\u0026nbspis a temporary trial and that it will seek feedback before making any further decisions.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,” Mr Khan said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“Unlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords has more than doubled from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricwaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent. Across England, lower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof boroughs need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two0bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain forms they can benefit certain groups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco found that some landlords converted their properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new-builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbsp improve dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The aerobatic display team have been granted formal approval on Wednesday to perform for audiences, known as Public Display Authority (PDA), to mark the official start of the Red Arrows\u0027 55th display seasonBased on an analysis of 1,600 benefit cases from welfare rights advisers across the UK, the report found people were being wrongly advised that decisions could not be appealed.\u0026nbspSome were wrongly told they needed to\u0026nbspprovide evidence to challenge a decision,\u0026nbspwhich delayed\u0026nbspor prevented\u0026nbsptheir efforts to have mistakes corrected.When people are refused when they first try to claim, their online account is often closed, which the report\u0026nbspsaid made\u0026nbspit even harder to get a decision reviewed because letters explaining why it was refused can no longer be accessed.One case cited in the report\u0026nbspsaid a single mother who worked\u0026nbsppart-time for McDonalds was left £560 short of her correct monthly entitlement because the system had said she was earning more than\u0026nbsp£1,500 more than she actually did.\u0026nbspThe DWP is sending universal credit deeper into meltdownMentally unwell universal credit claimant receives £5.82 to last monthIf May wants a real legacy she should stop the universal credit fiascoShe took payslips and bank statements to the jobcentre showing the amount she actually earned but they refused to change her entitlement, saying she had to raise it with HMRC.\u0026nbspCPAG said this advice was incorrect.Another case cited was that of\u0026nbspa young mother in Harrow was wrongly denied benefits after fleeing domestic abuse with her two young children. This\u0026nbspmeant she went\u0026nbsp“days without food”, it says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe 21-year-old\u0026nbsphad already submitted an MR, but it had been refused. It wasn’t until eight months later, when she got support to from her local Law Centre to take her case to tribunal, that the DWP reversed the decision and reinstated her benefits.Pamela Fitzpatrick, director of Harrow Law Centre, who supported the woman, said: “She finally got rid of the partner but he had isolated her from family and friends so she had nobody. Her six-month-old had a heart condition awaiting surgery.“When I saw her she was\u0026nbsprelying on social services to give her a tiny amount of money and food vouchers for the food bank, but she was having to walk to the food bank and back with the baby, living in dreadful accommodation under threat of eviction because she had no money to pay her rent. She hadn’t eaten in days.”Ms Fitzpatrick said the system was flawed because most MRs\u0026nbsprarely lead to a change in decision, although\u0026nbspcases are often\u0026nbspoverturned when they get to the tribunal appeal stage.She added that DWP staff were often not trained properly, seeing MRs as just a “rubber stamping”.“It also goes back to the issue of advice. There’s such as lack of welfare benefits advice and legal aid because there have been so many cuts over the years. People are struggling on their own. To find their way through the system is very difficult,” she said.More than half of universal credit denials overturned on appealIn the foreword to the CPAG report, Dame Laura Cox DBE, former justice of the High Court, said: “Many people are getting lost in the quagmire of the appeals process. Understandably they lose confidence in the system and give up. Erroneous decisions therefore stand, to the detriment of inidual families and to society as a whole.\u0026nbsp“If, due to complexity, inflexibility or incoherence, the appeals process in universal credit cases is almost impossible to understand and to pursue effectively, incorrect decisions go unchallenged and suffering is prolonged. Children fall through that safety net and our system of justice is undermined.Chief executive of Cpag Alison Garnham said the universal credit system “threw up so many obstacles” to getting a decision reviewed that some claimants – often the most vulnerable –\u0026nbsp were likely to give up and lose out.“The failure to ensure universal credit operates in a way that upholds basic legal duties is cause for serious concern. Universal credit staff dealing with claimants do not always seem to understand the rules as to how decisions can be challenged,” she added.A DWP spokesperson said: “We continue to work closely with CPAG and welcome the opportunity to do so. We have already improved guidance online and advice to staff about Mandatory Reconsiderations.\u0026nbsp“Anyone who disagrees with a benefits decision is able to request a Mandatory Reconsideration either online, by phone, in person or in writing.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I thought: ‘Oh my God they haven’t got a plan’.“That was really shocking frankly because the damage if you don\u0027t have a plan … it’s like Lance Corporal Jones you know, ‘Don’t panic, don’t panic’, running around like idiots.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It’s not useful to use it.”However, Ms May\u0027s official spokesman later insisted: The Prime Minister was clear in her discussions in public or in private that the UK could leave without a deal.The European Commission’s top official\u0026nbspMartin Selmayr, meanwhile, said he thought the UK was still unprepared to leave without a deal.“We have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit. We don’t see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border.”The EU secretly offered to put Brexit “on ice” for five years in order to come up with a new deal for Europe, Ms May’s de facto deputy David Lidington told Panorama.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The other three countries have brought in varying degrees of restrictions on Huawei.Theresa May is reported to have pressed through the inclusion of Huawei in the UK telecoms infrastructure at a meeting of the National Security Council two months ago. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, was subsequently sacked for allegedly leaking the decision to the media.However no formal announcement has been made on the decision.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanCommittee chairman Dominic Grieve said: “The debate over whether or not Huawei should be allowed to supply equipment to the UK 5G network has dragged on long enough and is damaging the UK’s international relationships.

And the government must weigh these, together with the security advice that any risk posed could be managed in a secure system, against the geostrategic issues outlined.“It is important to take the right decision, and take it we must: this debate has been unnecessarily protracted ... The new prime minister will no doubt have many issues to deal with in his first days in office. Nevertheless, this committee urges him to take a decision on which companies will be involved in our 5G network, so that all concerned can move forward.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The aerobatic display team have been granted formal approval on Wednesday to perform for audiences, known as Public Display Authority (PDA), to mark the official start of the Red Arrows\u0027 55th display seasonPublic sector pay rises were capped at 1 per cent after the Conservative-led coalition came to power at the beginning of the decade, but was scrapped last year as Ms May vowed to end the era of austerity.The rises to be announced on Monday do not apply to other public sector staff, such as nurses, whose pay is dealt with separately.Jonathan Cribb, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: These public sector pay rises are higher than last year\u0027s and considerably higher than the 1 per cent for many years before that.\u0026nbspIt is the highest nominal pay increase since the coalition. But these increases are still slower than pay rises that are happening on average in the private sector.With the partial exception of schools, there seems to be no new money to fund these pay rises, meaning savings will have to be made elsewhere.But Labour branded the rise insulting, and shadow chancellor John McDonnell added: After years of holding back the pay of our dedicated public sector workers, it is shameful for the government to pay for ending the public sector pay cap with more cuts.Brexit study hailed by Johnson says he is wrong to brand May’s ‘dead’Theresa May uses final speech to hit out at ‘populists’May now thinks telling people to ‘go home’ is wrong.

The other two are in Marlow, Buckinghamshire and at the British Airways headquarters near Heathrow.Waitrose will sell its stores in Bromley in south-east London, Oadby in Leicestershire and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire to Lidl. The buyer of the fourth shop, in Sandhurst, Berkshire, has asked not to be named.\u0026nbspDirector of shop trade at Waitrose Mark Gifford said: “We haven’t taken this decision lightly but we have to do what’s right for the business as a whole.\u0026nbsp“Waitrose \u0026amp Partners is on track for profit growth this year but, despite the best efforts of everyone involved, we haven’t been able to find a way to make these shops profitable in the long term.”The firm already sold five shops in March and closed five last year.\u0026nbspEarlier this year, Waitrose came top in the annual survey of supermarkets’ customers conducted by Which?, winning praise for the helpfulness of its staff, queueing times and the appearance of stores.

It was followed by a 6.4-magnitude temblor two days later.In the wake of the earthquakes, the governor of Nevada Steve Sisolak said he was committed to “fighting any continued federal effort to use Nevada as the nation\u0027s nuclear dumping ground.“These significant recent earthquakes so near to Yucca Mountain show one of the many geologic problems with the site as a nuclear waste repository,” he said.Mr Sisolak sent a letter to the energy secretary, Rick Perry, urging him to reconsider the location of the facility.Trump government \u0027trying to avoid cleaning up dangerous nuclear waste\u0027Finland shows the rest of how nuclear waste can be dealt withHow do you clean up nuclear waste? Simple, use a subatomic sieveThe US government began considering sites for storing radioactive waste that is produced as old nuclear fuel is reprocessed into nuclear weapon materials in 1982.In 2002, Yuka Mountain was designated as the only site in the country to receive the radioactive material.\u0026nbspBut Nevada has fought the proposed nuclear waste repository at every step, arguing\u0026nbspthat US government\u0026nbspstudies downplayed the risk of earthquakes damaging the repository and releasing deadly radioactivity.\u0026nbspThe project was shelved in 2010 under pressure from then-Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Barack Obama. They said nuclear waste should be stored in a state that wants it.\u0026nbspBut in March 2019, Mr Perry,\u0026nbspthe Trump administration\u0027s energy secretary,\u0026nbspset aside $116m to push forward the project and restart licensing hearings.RidgecrestIn\u0026nbspgovernor of Nevada’s letter to Mr Perry, he included the opinions of James Faulds at the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology and Graham Kent at the seismological laboratory at the University of Nevada.They urged for more research to be conducted into the seismic activity at the Yuka Mountain site. The Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, which began July 4 and has yet to subside, clearly highlights the importance of such studies, Mr Faulds and Mr Kent said.\u0026nbspA recent ranking compiled by the US Geological Survey found Nevada was the US state with\u0026nbspthe fourth highest level of seismic activity after Alaska, Wyoming and Oklahoma.Additional reporting by APOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His English was fairly limited and my Spanish went no further than: “Paella, mucho gracias.”So when, after several minutes of discussing the musical inspiration for his new single album , I went in for the killer question.“How many women have you slept with ”He shrugged.“ ” I ventured.He pulled an expression to suggest I had woefully misjudged his pulling power with the opposite sex. So I aimed higher.“, ”“Ooo knows ” he drawled with a lazy smile. “A gentleman  . . .  he never tell.”“Shall we go with , then ” I suggested, aswe were making a joint entry to one of those “guess how many sweets” attractions at the local fete. He shrugged again, a gesture I took as implicit confirmation. Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired. The majority of women swooned at the mere thought of a sacred moment in their seductive gaze, while young men felt both inspired and intimidated by such a dizzyingly high number of sexual conquests.But now  Thanks to the #metoo and #timesup campaigns, men with more notches on their bedposts than the rest of us have had hot dinners are regarded with certain distaste. Last week, Julio’s tongue-in-cheek statistic popped up again, when a -year-old man finally won recognition as the star’s son — the product of a brief affair in the s.Suddenly, the legendary “,” was being viewed through the modern-day, more puritanical prism, where such behaviour might be regarded as “sex addiction”.Whatever the truth , he’s now been with we Miranda Rijnsburger for more than  years and they have five children.So it’s fair to say that his womanising days are long gone. Just as well, perhaps. Because,the Love Island men are anything to go by, old roues are now old hat and it’s romantic and wholly faithful young men like Tommy Fury who, quite rightly, earn the nation’s admiration. Long may it go on.Though it seems there are still some lotharios refusing to go quietly. Last year, Italian playboy Maurizio Zanfanti,  — dubbed the “Romeo of Rimini” after claiming to have slept with , women — died while having sex with a -year-old tourist in his car. It’s what he would have wanted.JOBLESS Daniel Eyers and his pregnant partner Lucrezia Worrell say they have been evicted from their Kent council house for spending their rent money on takeaways.The couple, who have four children, are now living with Daniel’s mum. Daniel, , says: “I can’t get a job as it would mean my children would miss out on school, as I have to drive them there every day.”Oh let me count the ways.A flexible, part-time job perhaps  How about your partner taking them to school, or asking other parents for a lt  Or perhaps desisting from having a fth childyou can’t afford to keep the other four Meanwhile, let us compare and contrast this “can’t do” attitude with that of this father in Vietnam who drags his son across a raging, muddy river in a plastic bag so he can get to school, before ing to his remote village to work.A couple of years ago, we cowered inside a friend’s French holiday home as hailstones the size of golf balls rained down outside.Oh how we laughed . . . until I remembered our hire car parked outside.It was peppered with more dents than a Swiss cheese and, because we hadn’t taken out the “full insurance”, left us with a bill that cost more than the actual holiday.A BRIEF chat in front of the assembled cameras at Wimbledon was all it took for the Duchesses of Cambridgeand Sussexto dispel the long-standing rumours of a spat.Several weeks ago, it was also reported that the Duchess of Cambridge had fallen out with Rose Hanbury, one of her closest friends in the “Norfolk set”.The story has been dismissed as “unsubstantiated rumours” by sources within the Palace but it flared up again when Rose attended the recent Trump banquet without her husbandand was seated in practically a separate postcode to her old chum. Of course, they could kill those rumours stone dead too by being photographed together while out shopping or having lunch.That it hasn’t happened perhaps speaks volumes.AMAL CLOONEY is a well-regarded human rights lawyer who, together with husband George, uses her  to highlight ious liberal causes.So I was rather perplexed to hear – via a -page leaked document – that in  she reportedly gave legal advice to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on how to potentially sabotage the British government’s bid to arrest him.Whether you think Assange’s role in leaking , classied US documents was espionage or heroism, it remains that he was also trying to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faced charges of sexual assault.How, pray tell, does that fit in with liberal values JENNIFER Lopez is  later this month and credits her youthfulness to daily “self-affirmations”.“I tell myself ‘I am youthful and timeless’ every day a few times a day,” she says. It sounds like cliched bull****, but it’s not. Age is all in your mind.”Hmmm. Quite frankly, I could chant her mantra on a loop and never look like this.One suspects that regular exercise, healthy eating and an expensive skincare regime have played their part too.A SMALL number of residents currently living in the swanky London area of Hampstead are up in arms at proposed boundary changes that would place their homes in nearby Gospel Oak.“By severing political ties, you’re disenfranchising many residents,” says one.What they actually mean is: The price of our houses will plummet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The existing one, Philip Hammond, is too busy shamefully betraying his own Government and scorching the earth for the incoming regime.If No Deal IS a disaster, his miserable defeatism will be partly to blame.THE BBC’s betrayal of old folk becomes yet more sickening.Not content with stripping them of their free licence while paying millions to the likes of Gary Lineker, it intends to send out enforcers to demand the cash.These goons hammering on the doors of traumatised and confused OAPs are absurdly described as an “outreach team” carrying out a “support visit”.But the BBC’s self-harm doesn’t stop there. It turns out its breach of the funding deal with the Government will trigger a stampede of pension credit claims to qualy for an exemption from the fee.Cost to taxpayers . . . £.billion.This PM has given up.

known as fluorescein eye stain, to help detect damage to the eye’s outer covering.The dye turns the affected areas green when shone under a blue light.After discovering a defect in the woman’s cornea, they took samples of her eye — which tested positive for Acanthamoeba keratitis, a rare parasitic amoeba known to cause blindness.Dr Fu said the condition is associated with contact lens wear.Though rare, there have been a number of reported instances.Earlier this month, a football fan was blinded in his right eye after wearing his contact lenses in the shower.The infection is caused by a parasite that is usually found in bodies of water as well as taps, swimming pools, hot tubs, soil and air.Many dferent species of Acanthamoeba exist. Acanthamoeba organisms do not generally cause harm to humans , but they can cause a serious eye diseasethey infect the cornea.Symptoms can include:To avoid Acanthamoeba keratitis, never wear your contact lenses when youre coming into contact with water.Never wash contacts with tap water and never swim, shower or use a hot tub while wearing them.Always clean your contacts in lens solution the moment you take them out, or use daily disposables rather than monthlies.Nick Humphreys, , from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, has had to have two operations and is now waiting to have a corneal transplant after contracting a parasite burrowed into his eye.And last week we reported how a mum-of-two from Sydney feared shed lose her eyesight after a parasite burrowed into her eye when she went swimming in her lenses.Meanwhile, a teenager from Cornwall, says she developed a form of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis , after she contracted the parasitic infection.Skye Wheeler, , says she lives in constant fear that the bug - which is still sleeping in her eye - could cause her to go blind, or even kill her.In this recent case, the woman tested   in her left eye, making her “legally blind”.She was given medication to treat the infection but sadly never regained her vision due to her scarred cornea.The woman later underwent a partial corneal transplant, which improved her eyesight slightly and thre report says she is no longer in pain.The Acanthamoeba infection often travels through undistilled water, soil and even air.Those who use contacts put themselves at riskthey don’t take proper precautions — by removing the lenses before swimming and showering, or using tap water to clean them.According to a poll by YouGov for the sight charity,  per cent of contact lense wearers wear their contacts for longer than the recommended  hours a day, with  per cent saying theyd swum or showered in them.Meanwhile,  per cent said they had slept with contacts in, and  per cent said theyd put their contacts in their mouth to clean or lubricate them."},{"url":null,"title":"inside jeffrey epsteins lolita express private jet prince andrew","story":"New sordid details from le inside Epsteins informally known ‘Lolita Express’ have emerged as former guests recall the mid-air sex lair, complete with padded floors.Photos from Epstein’s long-time personal pilot Larry Visoski and the glossy pages of a sale brochure, reveals the jets plush purpose-built interior.The luxury Boeing  aircraft boasts deluxe furnishings, a spacious galley, expansive cabin lounge and a master bedroom.The jets detailed sale prospectus, as seen by The Sun Online, describes the -passenger interior as tailored to enhance the experience during long range travel.Exactly what happened on the flights where Epstein courted his famous friends and underage girls alike, remained a closely guarded secret.But recently resurfaced accounts detail wild orgies and padded floors purposely designed for sex mid-flight.Lavish red velvet chairs and sofas offer the ultimate comfort as he flew between his million-dollar houses across the world.The luxury commercial jet also features a circular shaped lounge filled with sprawling beige chairs, leading to a spacious private bedroom.Inside the room lies a queen size bed, a sitting area, a small desk and study and a private en suite with integrated shower.Sealed inside the mahogany or teak walls are spacious mirrored wardrobes and drawers.A separate dining area comes complete with a galley kitchen for preparing food.Additional window treatments throughout the aircraft are fitted with custom shades behind tinted glass.Its alleged Epstein used his plane to fly underage girls between his residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico and the Caribbean island of Little St James.The playboy billionaire and paedophile has since been accused of having group sex with young girls on the bed he had privately installed.She also alleged her sexually abusing her for years on his private jet as well as his ious homes.Roberts, now , claimed she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew by Epstein in London, New York and the Caribbean.The Duke of York was pictured with his arm around the then -year-olds waist at the home of Ghislane Maxwell -  a personal aide to the financier - in London in  but has strongly denied the claims.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “It is categorically denied that The Duke of York received massages from unclothed women at any party given by Mr Epstein.”An additional statement read: “The Duke of York has not visited any home of Mr Epstein or met with him since December  when the photograph in Central Park was taken.”Many believe Epsteins pilot Visoski, who flew the financier for  years, knows more about what went on in the skies.In the past the captain has admitted he knew minors were on board, Mail Online reported.However, he said he never suspected Epstein of having sex with them.Regularly posting selfies in front of the jets to his Instagram page, the chief pilot manages the million fleet.Two women who were involved with Epstein in the early s spoke with Vanity Fair on Thursday.One, a former model who was at the time freshly out of college, told the publication of the time Epstein gave her and a group of older men a tour of his jet.She recalled the moment she realised the jets floors were padded, saying: Wow, rich people are weird.I was so stupid and naïve—Why are padded floors cool  I was too young to get it.She added that the other men winked and joked with each other, knowing the floors were designed so that Epstein could have sex on the floor at , feet.Epsteins wealthy friends often travelled with him on his private jet, dubbed the “Lolita Express” by the Press.On the plane, with bed aboard, Epstein is said to have hosted wild orgies as he flew to his houses in New York, Florida and New Mexico and to his own Caribbean island of Little St James.Flight logs reveal he flew former US president Bill Clinton, actor Kevin Spacey, model Naomi Campbell and Prince Andrew aboard the Boeing .A Clinton spokesman yesterday said he only took four flights and insisted he knew “nothing about the terrible crimes”.US President Donald Trump also hobnobbed with Epstein, saying in a  interview: “I’ve known Jeff for  years. Terric guy.“He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautul women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”Prosecutors allege Epstein amassed a “vast network” of girls as young as  who he would lure to his homes and sexually abuse.When officers raided his seven-storey townhouse in New York earlier this month, they found rooms stuffed with sex toys and thousands of pictures of naked women and girls.On Monday, a dishevelled Epstein, wearing a blue prison-issue unorm, appeared at a court in Manhattan and pleaded not guilty.His attorneys argued the case is a “do-over” of the  Florida case, which saw him serve  months in prison.Back then, police had launched an investigation after a -year-old girl told police an older man named “Jeff” had molested her at his home.A plea bargain saw him sign a non-prosecution agreement to dodge federal charges that might have sent him to prison for le.He ended up pleading guilty to minor state charges in Palm Beach and served  months in a private wing of a county jail, mostly on work release.The “sweetheart deal” has since been much criticised and was the subject of an investigation by the Miami Herald newspaper last year.It emerged that authorities had discovered a disturbing teen sex ring — with the same type of allegations that Epstein faces now.Victims told police how they would be led to Epstein’s bedroom to give him massages, before he told them to remove their clothing. It was alleged he would then sexually assault them, paying them up to £ per visit.But the state attorney’s office in Palm Beach declined to pursue the more serious charges, claiming the girls were not credible.Prosecutors feared they would lose at trial, in part due to Epstein’s lawyers dredging up dirt on the victims, including social media posts indicating drug use.Now, following pressure from alleged victims and the media in light of the #MeToo movement, prosecutors are looking again.Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, says his old non-prosecution deal is only binding with prosecutors in Florida.Courtney Wild and Michelle Licata — who were among Epstein’s accusers in the previous criminal case in Florida in  — sat in court for his hearing on Monday.Miss Wild previously revealed she was still a braces-wearing -year-old schoolgirl when Epstein allegedly forced her to perform sex acts.She says she went on to recruit other girls for him, adding: “He told me he wanted them as young as I could find them.“If I had a girl to bring him at breakfast, lunch and dinner, then that’s how many times I would go a day.“He wanted as many girls as I could get. It was never enough.”Lawyer David Boies, who represents a number of Epsteins accusers, said: “We hope that prosecutors will not stop with Mr Epstein.“There were many other people who participated with him and made the sex trafficking possible.”Epstein remains behind bars as his trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"boris backer jacob rees mogg joins push for no deal brexit if new pm cant get brand new deal","story":"The top Brexiteer joined a group of MPs urging the new PM to rip up Theresa Mays deal completely and start again.AndBoris or Hunt cant get a new deal, then he wants the next leader to go for a No Deal instead on October .In a video for grassroots group Stand up  Brexit today he insisted the deal was defunct.And he added: There must be no more shilly-shallying.We need to leave on dferent terms, whether that is with an agreement or not.Mr Rees-Mogg, who is a backer of frontrunner Boris Johnson, said that it wasnt just the hated backstop but the rest of the withdrawal agreement that does not work, and the new PM must get something dferent.He insisted that Boris would lt our spirits and peddle optimism to show how we can make the economy work outside the EU.We must leave on the  October, he said.It has been promised to voters not just once in the referendum in  but also by the  general election.There is a great future for this country outside the failed economic model of the European Union.He later told Radio  that a new deal should be much simpler and only involve the guarantee of citizens rights and moving towards a free trade deal.Yesterday Boris suffered a defeat at the hands of anti-No Deal MPs, who passed a vote making it much harder to take us out without an agreement.Three more backers are set to join the Stand up  Brexit campaign today -

We ended up canoodling so much on the plane, when the air hostess came round with hot towels she said to us ‘cold towel ’”Talking about the musical, Diane, , added: “Watching the kiss up on stage is like renewing our vows. It takes us back to a special time.”The title for the show is taken from the name Newfoundlanders give to visitors - Come From Away.Before jets had the capacity to cross the Atlantic without refuelling they would stop off in Gander, so it had an airstrip big enough to cope with a sudden deluge of Jumbos.It was a part of Operation Yellow Ribbon where nearly  jets were landed in  Canadian airports.The then Mayor of Gander Claude Elliott was faced with the mammoth task of feeding and housing , guests many of whom didn’t speak English.Claude, who has since retired from his post, said: “What we consider the most simple thing in le is to help people.”And they certainly did that.Nicotine gum was brought for smokers stuck on the planes, when locals were asked to donate toilet roll a year’s supply was delivered in a day and a massive birthday party was organised for  Make-A-Wish Foundation children who had been due to celebrate their own special day in Disneyland.For security reasons the passengers were not allowed to take their bags from the hold, so locals donated blankets, clothes, sanitary towels, nappies and tooth brushes.In order to keep the food supplies cool the local hockey rink was transformed into a massive refrigerator and BBQs were loaned for grill night.No matter how many times, the guests offered to pay for food or drink they were always refused.So after leaving  the passengers decided  to make a donation of £, to the town.Even when retired oil executive Nick and retired retail buyer Diane came back for their honeymoon in  a lavish banquet was put on in their honour.It was then that the press learned of their story - but the couple refused to speak to the journalists camped outside their door.Nick explained: “It took us so long to tell our story because we had survivors guilt.Over three thousand people died in the Towers, so over , families were devastated by what happened.“What happened to us  We found someone who made us so happy. We weren’t comfortable with that. Why us ”After Come From Away made its stage debut in  the couple slowly started to realise relatives of people affected by   had taken to this story of human kindness.Among them is Hannah O’Rourke, a passenger featured in the musical whose firefighter son Kevin died saving  lives in the World Trade Centre.In the show we see her being comforted by a local as she waits to learn of his fate.Nick, who has become friends with Hannah, said: “At one of the openings last year I was sat next to the daughter of Kevin O’Rourke, and when it got to the very sad part of the play I reached out to her and she held on to my hand until the end of the play.”Come From Away is now on at the Phoenix Theatre in London.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Crafty George Osborne, who was Chancellor  when a deal was stitched up, believed forcing the BBC to fund the leline would save the Government £million a year from . But the Treasury’s own watchdog yesterday revealed the move could backfire - ultimately costing more than it saves. The Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed spending on Pension Credit was set to rise because of the move to restrict free licences to only those who receive the benefit. Many who are eligible but do not currently take up the benefit are now likely to do so amid a planned advertising blitz by the BBC to raise awareness of entitlement, the OBR said.  The Department for Work and Pensions should be braced for a surge in demand for Pension Credit, it suggests. OBR chairman Robert Chote said it “illustrates the dangers of unintended consequences when governments come up with clever ways to save money”. Its fiscal risks report says: “DWP estimates there were around , people aged  or over who were entitled to the guarantee element of pension credit in - but who did not receive it, almost  per cent of the total number entitled. “These had an average entitlement of £ a week, resulting in around £.billion of unclaimed benefit among this age group. So around half of that group would need to start claiming to wipe out the expected savings from transferring responsibility to the BBC and the BBC cutting its domestic spending by a corresponding amount.”    While “very large increases in take-up are unlikely”, the Corporation’s plan to publicise the availability of Pension Credit will lead to more people taking it up. It adds: “It is relatively unusual for a government to delegate parameters of welfare policy to a broadcasting company in an attempt to save money, and it is perhaps not surprising that this may have unintended consequences. “The BBC’s decision to means-test free TV licences via a link to pension credit receipt may well raise welfare spending by more than it reduces BBC spending ... The net effect on the public finances would therefore be to push the budget deficit up not down.” Stressing the move posed a fresh risk to public coffers, the OBR goes on: “The likely cost of the BBC’s recent decision to means-test free TV licences for the over-s by linking it to pension credit – thereby potentially prompting a material number of those currently not taking it up to do so – poses a fiscal risk that we had not previously envisaged.  The Corporation announced this Spring that only over-s receiving Pension Credit will be eligible for free licences. Just . million OAPs are likely to be continue receiving free licences, while an estimated . million will lose out. The Mirror is campaigning to save the benefit, with more than , readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper. More than , people have signed Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for free licences to be preserved and the Government to take back responsibility. Setting up a system to means-test eligibility will cost the BBC £million, with £million annual running costs, MPs heard.Bectu broadcasting chief Philippa Childs said: “The Office of Budget Responsibility is confirming what we have said all this time - that the Government should not be outsourcing responsibility for decisions on welfare benefit policy.“Since the BBC’s announcement, there has been an unexpected consequence highlighting how many older people should have been in receipt of the Pension Credit.“This shows the Government should take back responsibility.“By passing the buck onto the BBC, it has fundamentally undermined this public service broadcaster by changing the nature of its relationship with its loyal viewers and dedicated workers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt says missed crucial","story":"NewsJeremy Hunt says he missed crucial no-deal Brexit vote by accidentThe details man in the Tory leadership contest says he got confused about whether he needed to vote or notShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Hunt says he missed yesterday’s crucial no-deal Brexit vote by accident.A string of ministers abstained on the vote, which could block the next Prime Minister from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit .

He’s a young man within , votes of unseating the future PM in an increasingly marginal constituency. This wouldn’t just be the first time a sitting prime minister lost his seat in a general election. For a Muslim ­immigrant to beat a man whose ­arguably racist comments about “letterboxes” and “piccaninnies” refer to around % of his own multi-ethnic constituents, it would also be poetic justice. “I hear that phrase a lot,” Ali says. “On so many levels. I’m the candidate that happens to be Muslim and ­immigrant. I’m also the local candidate, and the working-class candidate. I was born in Iran and came over at the age of five with my mum, so people also see it as poetic justice for Nazanin.”    Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe is the imprisoned British Iranian mother further endangered by Boris when he was Foreign Secretary. “The buffoon character has consequences,” Ali says. “Nazanin is one of the consequences.” Johnson was parachuted into Uxbridge as the Tory candidate in , after leaving office as mayor. The  election saw his majority halved, partly due to shting ­demographics, and partly, claims Ali, due to his lack of time spent in the area. “It’s so rare to get Boris here in the constituency that you need David Attenborough to narrate it,” Ali says dryly. “You could drop him off at the end of the road and he wouldn’t be able to find Uxbridge station.” Then there’s the thorny local issue of Heathrow expansion. “Boris was going to lie down in front of the bulldozers but he ran away to Afghanistan instead,” Ali says. “I’m a Heathrow councillor. There are villages that will be devastated by Heathrow expansion in my ward. I’ll stand up for them.”    The contrast between the two men could hardly be wider. Ali grew up in a working-class household where his mum often had to choose between feeding the gas or electricity meter. “Even in my wildest dreams I never thought I would stand to be an MP,” he says. “Becoming an MP doesn’t happen for people like me who grow up in a council house raised by a single mum. MPs are people like Boris – Etonians.”Instead, the Manchester United fan dreamed of becoming a goalkeeper, only losing out on a place at Fulham academy when genetic testing showed he wasn’t going to be tall enough.He pulls himself up to his ft in height. “Science was right,” he smiles.” Ali joined the Labour Party when he was at Brunel University, after hearing alumni and Shadow ­Chancellor John McDonnell speak. “My generation has been hit with everything – tuition fees tripled, we’d lost EMA, the maintenance grant was gone. My mum was made homeless from her council house. “I decided to get politically active and I went to a meeting. I thought I’d give him hell. But by the end of the meeting I said to him, ‘I want to canvas for you’. That broke the barrier in my mind against joining a political party.” The former vice president of the National Union of Students laughs and says a few MPs have advised him to “get a real job” before becoming an MP.    “I don’t need to work in Goldman Sachs for some le experience,” he says. “Real le experience is when your mum can’t afford the electricity to cook. It’s spending my first day at school terried because I couldn’t speak English. It’s considering picking up a kne to protect yourself, which luckily I never did.” In any case, Ali says he’s lost several job offers since announcing his candidacy. “They were with organisations who need to get on with the new prime minister, I understand that.” He’s also had death threats since standing.He shows me a message on Twitter about his candidacy: “I hope your family are well protectedyou do this”.Ali shrugs. “I went to a school in North West London where you left by dferent entrances depending on what gang you were in. I had knives pulled on me regularly. I got beaten up. This has happened all my adult le. So I’m not that bothered.” Boris, he says, “is going the Trump route. The veneer’s slipping. The ­dference between Trump and ­traditional Republicans isn’t policy, it’s that language has dropped the veneer. We need to give our own simple answer that the people with black and brown skin living next door have more in common with you than someone who made £million tanking the economy.“Words have consequences. I was at a primary school to give a talk.

The coupleaposs builders planned to do further extensive work in the garden of Frogmore Cottage .But the Duke and Duchess of Sussex changed their mind about the design of the garden after they were granted planning permission by their local council. Newly released documents show that the couple are now seeking retrospective planning consent for external landscaping works’’ after opting for a dferent design. They could be forced to reverse the work at their padplanning consent is refused.      The royal couple moved into the Grade II listed Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate in April ahead of the birth of their first child Archie. The cottage received an extensive £. million renovation funded by £.m from the taxpayer and £, from themselves, according to sources. The cottage was gted to the Duke and Duchess by the Queen last year, with Kensington Palace confirming the move in November, saying Windsor was a very special place for the couple. Frogmore Cottage is located near of Windsor Castle, the Queenaposs summer residence, and St Georgeaposs Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Ian Ratclfe, project manager at the Royal Household said in an email to the council’s planning enforcement team: “This application has been submitted following a material change to elements to the granting of planning consent.” Under planning law, a retrospective planning application is submitted to the councila change is made to a property that requires planning permission and approval has not been sought.    A local authority can also request that a retrospective planning application is submitted for the work that has already carried out. However, it does not mean that planning permission will automatically be granted and the application will be treated in the usual way. If the retrospective application is refused, the local authority can issue an enforcement notice which could require the couple to reverse any changes made to Frogmore Cottage. Under the plans revealed by a well-placed royal source last month, the plans include provision for a tennis or badminton court at the coupleaposs Windsor home. There are also said to be plans for exterior painting and landscaping, the installation of security lights and the planting of £,-worth of fast-growing shrubs and trees.  Several baby friendly features for the couple’s child Archie as well as a vegetable garden so the couple can grow their own produce are also included. The revised plans, according to the source, will be slightly dferent following a last-minute change of heart by the royal couple. A well-placed source said: “Some changes have been made to the plans to create the Duke and Duchess’s garden after the original planning consent was granted. “Frogmore Cottage will be the perfect place for a royal prince to grow up with the Duke and Duchess and these changes are very important to create a perfect home for themselves and Archie. “These specic changes are currently being dealt with the local council to avoid the need for any action.

Lucy Noble, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, is so money savvy she has already done all her Christmas shopping - by buying gts in the January sales. The -year-old, who is dubbed tightapos by her pals also s full-price items as soon as they go into the sales and then buys them again at the reduced price. Virtual assistant Lucy said: My mates say that I’m tight, but I say I’m just thrty. I’m obsessed with making savings – it takes over your le. I do spend a lot of time on my phone. I would say about two to three hours a day looking for offers. My husband tells me off quite a bit for it.    I’ve always been a bit of a bargain hunter and started trying to save money when I was in my early s. My sister used to sell a lot of stuff on eBay, so I started doing that, then it went on from there. But itaposs only in the last few years that Lucy, who is married to Chris, , and mum to Abbey, six, and Owen, nine, has come into her own as a coupon fan and bargain hunter. She said: I’ve been taking it more seriously for the last couple of years. I discovered you could save quite a lot of money by using coupons.With Facebook you can join all these dferent money saving groups, with people looking for bargains or saving tips, she said.Years ago I would cut supermarket coupons out of magazines and now you can find them online and from using dferent apps on your phone. There are receipt scanning apps, where you enter your receipt and get so many points then they send you vouchers. I’ve had Amazon vouchers which I’ll end up saving for Christmas.  I search ‘latest freebies’ and you can get all sorts – food, make-up, toys, as well as skincare samples. I will sign up to do product testing. By doing that, St Tropez sent me a full-size fake tan bottle worth £. And one of Lucyaposs top tips is to join groups which alert thrt shoppers to bargains. She regularly uses Try It, which tells users when emails are going out offering freebies, the Ashleigh Money Saver websites, which informs members about sales or deals offered by retailers and Reward Me Now app – which lets you buy a code to get discounts of up to  per cent – which can be used alongside other offers. Lucy was thrilled when she saved £ just by using the vouchers to buy dinner and drinks in her local pub. She said: I get such a buzz when I see a bargain. Last Christmas I got some dressing gowns for £ each and they reduced the price two days later, so I took them back and got a refund, then bought them again for £.. Most of my friends say, ‘Oh I wouldn’t dare to do that,’ but I’m saving money, so why wouldn’t I  It was £. to spend on something .    I willthings evenbuying them again in the sale only means saving a couple of pounds, because I would rather have that money back. I’ve ordered things online before, then realised two days later they have reduced the price, so Iaposve ordered them again at the cheaper amount and sent the originals back to get a full price refund. Lucy has even managed to get her weekly shop down to £ for a family of four, which works out at just under £ a day. She uses offers and the Feed your Family for Around £ a Week Facebook page and with careful meal planning, saving more than £, a year. Lucy said: Some people say they don’t have time to do it, but it doesn’t have to take a long timeyou plan carefully. Before I go shopping I will check online for offers, check the apps and then decide what supermarket to go to. I’m thinking about what I’m going to do for the kids’ tea throughout the week and how many meals I can make from something. Nothing is wasted. I cook stuff like Bolognese from scratch, working out how much we will eat and freezing the rest. If we have a chicken we will use everything – we’ll even use the carcass for stock for a soup. You can also buy fresh vegetables for just as little. You can find them for p.    I go to the local butcher who often has offers on, too, and stock up, putting items in the freezer. It’s great, as I’m saving money and the kids are eating healthily. It’s just about being organised and being savvy. I used to spend about £ a week and I’ve managed to reduce that by £ which really adds up over a year. And it isnapost just the food shop where Lucy saves a fortune - sheaposs also the queen of booking cheap holidays.  She said: We shop around for the cheapest deal. We managed to get a holiday this summer for four people for £, – flights and accommodation in Benidorm and that’s during the school holidays, when things are at their most expensive. I was speaking to someone at the school gates who was spending £, to £, on their familyaposs summer holiday, so we’ve saved lots of money. We book flights separately using dferent websites to look for cheaper ones and self-catering accommodation in quieter, more residential areas. We then budget to spend  euros a day. We donapost eat every meal out and buy food from the local supermarket, which saves a lot of money.  I’ll book activities online before we go, too. My husband found you could go on one site and book activities in advance, paying  euros instead of  euros at the resort. When it comes to having the perfect family Christmas, Lucy is already organised by July - including wrapping all her presents. She said: I do most of my Christmas shopping in the January sales. I’ve got an airing cupboard full of stuff all wrapped up, which is a bit of a nightmare. I also get birthday presents, sothe kids end up going to a party they have a gt already. I make a note of all the things I’ve bought so I don’t forget. Friends will spend £ to £ per child at Christmas, while I don’t really have a budget, but I try and keep it below £. Having things bought and wrapped takes so much of the stress out of it. Friends will go out on Christmas Eve to get presents and I can’t think of anything worse than doing that. I’ll also collect make-up samples, which make great little gts, and looking out for free items you get with magazines. Quite often you’ll pay £ for the magazine and get a mascara worth £, so I’ll go to dferent shops to buy the same magazine but with a dferent gt. I am bargain crazy andI see a shop closing down I’ll have a really good look for stuff. I want to seeI can get stuff for as cheap as possible.  I will pay full price occasionally, but very rarely, andI can I will get it discounted. I have no idea how much I save, but I think it must be thousands of pounds, especially when you take into account the savings on holidays. I get stuck with the label of being tight, butI can save money that will go into my savings - meaning we can take the kids on a nice holiday, so it’s worth doing.” Lucy’s top five tips: . Use coupons and cashback websites . Plan your meals for the week . Do not be afraid to take items back. That’s money in your pocket rather than in the retaileraposs till. . Double up by using vouchers and discount codes together. .to get freebies in the post. Lucy said: “Sometimes I won’t remember I’ve signed up to something and then it will turn up on the doorstep.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum young family living home","story":"NewsMum-of-four forced to live in home crawling with mice after housing nightmareDanielle Sweeney, , reveals she has hit rock bottom over the conditions she is forced to live in at the home in Oldham, Greater ManchesterShareCommentsByDavid Coleman:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video danielle-hunt-talks-hitting-rock-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum and her young family are living in a house aposcrawling with miceapos after being left with no better alternative. Danielle Sweeney, , reveals she has hit aposrock bottomapos over the conditions she is forced to live in. The mum-of-four said the boiler room and under the kitchen cupboards in the temporary accommodation in Oldham, Greater Manchester, are covered in rat poison. Danielle, supported by partner David Johnson - who works as a plastics moulder - has had to buy her own traps to supplement the ones provided to her. The shocking conditions have left one of Danielleaposs children on anti-depressants. She also revealed David is afraid to leave her alone in case she does something stupid.The family were forced to leave their old home after the owners decided to sell up, the Manchester Evening News reports.She was pregnant with daughter Lottie at the time. And she revealed the following seven months have been a nightmare.    Danielle couldnapost afford to move into another privately-rented property. The council advised her to present herself formally as homeless. The family was first housed in a BB, before being moved to a flat. They then moved again, to their current temporary accommodation, where in Oldham. Danielle says the flat, owned by First Choice Homes, was dirty and aposcrawling with miceapos when she moved in.  Her elder kids - , ten and eight - have been sleeping in bunk beds for the past six months. She told the Local Reporting Democracy Service: My daughter’s five-months-old and I can’t let her go on the floor because it’s hanging. I’ve had to duct tape up all the skirting boards because mice were getting out of the holes. Now you can hear them scratching in the walls. It’s not something you want your kids to see when they get up in the morning... a dead mouse. Everything is in storage, the kids have had no toys for nearly two months. We don’t even have Wi-Fi.”    First Choice Homes bosses said they strive to provide the ‘highest quality’ of housing and are speaking to Danielle about her concerns. Pest control is delivered by the council, they added. Danielle added: “The kids don’t sleep at all here, andit’s not the noise of the lt, it’s parties, and police cars and ambulances because we’re right next to the hospital. “The kids are going school tired, my little girl’s not been going to her dance classes because of all this. “I have hit rock bottom. “I just want us to have a proper home.” Thataposs proving incredibly dficult. Danielle says sheaposs bid for around  other properties. The only one sheaposs been offered is around the corner from a housing project for single men. The facility, on Spring Street in Greenacres, is operated as supported accommodation for men who otherwise would be homeless. It takes people through referrals who have left prison have drug or alcohol issues or have been victims of domestic abuse. Danielle says her children would be unsafe living near the facility. The council insists the arrangement would be appropriate. Danielle says she has been told thatshe doesnapost move in, the town hall wonapost continue to house her family.She said   the move would mean her eldest son catching two buses to school, or walking an hour through aposroughapos parts of the town.   The council says the property is ‘suitable’ and that the children would not have to travel ‘excessive distance’ to get to their schools in Royton. Town hall bosses highlight that there are , families waiting for the type of house Danielle wants - a three-bedroom property. I’ve not bid on that property, I don’t drive and it would be nearly an hour and half journey to get the kids to school, Danielle said. What they’ve said is aposchange schoolapos. My daughter is going into her last year of primary school. Why should I uproot her in her last year  Speaking about the property sheaposs been offered, Danielle added: We went to look at the property at am on a Saturday morning and two grown men were in the street fighting over drugs. There were men sat in the street drinking cans. A home is what you make of it, but when you look and it’s right next to a facility and men are fighting, it’s not right for a family of four children. Danielle appealed the accommodation offer, but was unsuccessful. She intends to take the council to court. The town hallaposs cabinet member for housing Coun Hannah Roberts said bosses considered it aposreasonableapos for Danielle to accept the property under homelessness legislation. “Oldham council has been in constant touch with Ms Sweeney for a number of months in a bid to resolve her housing situation, she added. “We have offered her accommodation which we consider to be suitable for the needs of her and her family. “We do sympathise with her situation and officers have worked hard and as fast as possible to reach a conclusion that is agreeable to all the parties involved. “However, Oldham, like boroughs across the country has a lack of three-bedroom properties and we cannot always offer people homes in the areas which they want.

Queues of up to  minutes are expected today as families head off on their summer breaks.

The RAC is warning drivers to brace themselves for the aposbusiest summer getaway since apos with an estimated . million separate summer getaway trips planned this weekend. About . million drivers are expected to hit the road after school breaks up for the summer late this afternoon.    Piled on top of the usual Friday rush, motorists can expect long queues after school term ends with peak traffic expected at around .pm on the M between junctions  and . And waiting until Saturday is unlikely to ease the pain of heavy congestion. Another  million holidaymakers are expected to hit the road tomorrow.  Transport analysts say the M and M are likely to be the worst affected - with queues stretching upward of  minutes.  Light rain across parts of England and heavier downpours in the south of Wales will put a dampener on some travellersapos weekends. The gloomy skies make it perfect getaway time for the millions flocking to the airports for trips abroad. But those travelling by rail for a domestic holiday will be rewarded with a heatwave after suffering a grim weekend, as temperatures are forecast to hit C next week.

The diesel spillage from a broken down vehicle is causing traffic to queue on the motorway as clean-up crews work on getting the motorway back in action. The spill stretches from Junction  for the Ato Junction  for the A . A ersion is underway via the A, and the motorway is hoped toto normal by .-.am.

Tega Agberhiere, , suffered severe burns to his face in April when he was targeted while out with friends in Waterford, Ireland. The former Tottenham and Crystal Palace academy star was left blinded initially, while also suffering severe burns to his face and thighs. Since the ordeal, he has undergone a number of skin grafts, involving skin from his leg being transplanted to his face, reports Irish Mirror. But he has a haze over his right eye that will probably be there forever.  “I’m recovering and it’s been tough, he said. I’m taking every day as it comes. Tega had been out with two of his friends when the attack happened. The trio were all rushed to University Hospital Waterford before Tega was transferred to Cork. The teenager, an Ireland underage football player, says he is now focusing on recovery and back to doing light training. He hopes to play football in the forthcoming season.    Speaking previously about the agony he endured, Tega said: “I can’t describe it. When I got here I thought I’d never be able to see again. “I % thought I’d never be able to see another thing in my le.” Surgeons are so far happy with how the skin grafts have worked, but Tega has been told the eyesight in this right eye will probably never recover fully. He is trying to be as upbeat as possible, but the pain has been so bad he was forced to miss his accountancy Leaving Cert exam last month.    Tega’s mother, Christy Agberhiere, said that the family were just taking things “moment by moment”. They have thanked all the people who had supported the family through what has been a very, very dficult period. “We are not just taking it day by day, we are taking it moment by moment,” she said.

This is going to let us trace the stories of the people linked to the first reference of the still.“The royal references are really limited but these will allow us to build up the story with the surrounding context. It’s going to let us put names and inidual people to the story of this still.”The record also includes suggestions about where the still may have been located – with the spot believed to be on a street already associated with whisky.Dr Armstrong added: “Andrew Gray had property in a street known as Guestrow.“Today just a small section of Guestrow remains and it is home to the appropriately named ‘Illicit Still’ pub.“The name recalls a later age when whisky was crafted for sale undetected by the taxman, but it is possible that its location has a connection to the history of Scotch going back much further.“This is a very signicant find in the history of our national drink.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too. He told the committee: ldquoIt has been dficult attracting sponsorship and corporate hospitality because of the uncertainty however, this seems to be improving."},{"url":null,"title":"mystery-of-hidden-signatures-from-1940-solved-from-new-zealand","story":"Mikey McKinnon, , who owns McKinnon Decorators, was asked by the owners of the property on Eskview Terrace to strip off old woodchip wallpaper and repaint the walls in the hallway.As he got to work, he found that previous decorators had signed and dated their work, as is tradition in the trade.But Mikey, from Edinburgh, was stunned to see that the signatures were almost  years old ndash and curious about the men behind them.The lettering was feint but legible and said: lsquoPapered by David M Steeples A.R.P,  June, , assisted by Robt N Bannerman, R.A.F, L.D.V.rsquoKeen to seehe could find out more as he had to paint over the signatures, he got in touch with the Courier and we appealed for readersrsquo help for information on the duo.And the mystery was solved by Margaret Paterson, , from the Levenhall area of Musselburgh ndash a friend of Mr Steeplesrsquo daughter Jenny Body, who now lives in New Zealand.She had just ed home from visiting Jenny and was told of the newspaper article by her friends George and Florence Wilson, who live in Musselburgh town centre.Margaret said: ldquoBefore I went, I told them about my trip and who I was visiting.ldquoIf I had not, George would not have known the Steeples name and would not have asked methere was a connection with the newspaper article and photograph of the paintersrsquo signatures.The Steeples family had a shop at the top of Links Street and lived above the shop in front of Musselburgh Congregational Church.Margaret lived across the road at  Links Street and she and Jenny, whom she knew as Janet then, were best friends, both attending Musselburgh Grammar School.ldquoI remember her dad as a man in white overalls who was always busy and then he went into the army, said Margaret.Jenny, , emigrated to New Zealand in .Margaret said: ldquoWe lost touch for a while but met up again when she came on one of her visits home.ldquoMy husband died last August and, when I let Jenny know, she immediately asked me out to New Zealand for a visit, which I did in February.Jenny added: ldquoOur first shop belonged to my grandfather and his brother and was on North High Street opposite where The Brunton is now.ldquoThe building is still there and belonged to my great aunt until the s.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Not that it would have made much dference. Unlike the French player who had sobbed uncontrollably after conceding the menrsquos doubles final, the Swiss maestro is made of sterner stuff. Of course being worsted must have been hard. The ferocity of the game spoke to how much each player wanted to win.

They were risking a lot, and the strain of dealing with so much hate, and seeing accusations filed away with zero action taken, took its toll. Several found their mental health suffering. One contemplated suicide.It was left to these youngsters, as it was left to the four congresswomen in the US, to make a stand against, and to suffer the consequences of, other peoplersquos failure to lead. The older, the wiser, the more experienced and powerful, might come along in time, but they could not be counted on.Accepted wisdom has it that we are living in the era of the populist strongmen. The Trump, the Orban, the Putin, the Duterte. How did it happen  Because as societies we were seduced by the notion of simplicity. Le was busy and stressful, the political problems we faced were complex and seemingly intractable, the pace of change was unrelenting. Along came people who said they had the answers. Who said donrsquot listen to those so-called ldquoexperts who tell you things cannot be done. Who promised to sort things out because it was all very simple, really.: Easier to believe lie than seek truthThe phenomenon was not the sole preserve of the seemingly strong, or men. It was Theresa May, after all, who coined the phrase ldquoBrexit means Brexit and look at the chaos she unleashed. Nor is it only to be seen on the right. Mr Corbyn, or rather his closest aides, operate like a collective strongman, treating any criticism as an attack that must be crushed.There are indeed answers to societyrsquos ills, and at heart we know what they are. Homelessness  Build more houses, and tackle the deep rooted problems that brought the person to sleep on the streets. Itrsquoll cost you, and it wonrsquot be easy. End child poverty  Not cheap, and it will take time. No NHS waiting lists  Open your purse and expect a wait. Save the planet  Extremely expensive, as well as a pain in the backside. So much easier to believe in the simple answer or turn the other way.One would like to think the pendulum was about to swing back, as people began to see that this drive for simplicity was exacting its own price, whether it be in ever widening inequality or worsening social stre. But then this time next week, barring an upset, we will witness Boris Johnson becoming PM. Mr Johnson is a king among Simple Simons. This is a man whose answers to problems are so snappy they can fit on the side of a bus. A man who oozes laziness, who reeks of the quick fix that turns out to be the bodge job, who changes his position to please whoever he is speaking to at the time.The irony is that far from being strong, what all these leaders have in common is their weakness, and that will begin to show itself when their fortunes change. It may not happen in time to stop the next one coming to power, but it will happen. If it does not, we will all be saying what we see: one unholy mess of a world."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-mccoo-isn-39-t-art---39-s-sign-39-s-wrong-scottish-culture","story":"Brown gave us McCoo - his most famous, repeated image. A rainbow highland cow. His Ayr company went into liquidation this week, however. It had a turnover of pound.million and employed  staff. Cash flow and creditor pressure were blamed. Last year, Brown sold his Oor Wullie and Big Tam McCoo painting for pound,.The loss of  jobs is a personal tragedy for everyone affected, and Brown is a man hard not to admire. He found fame and wealth after overcoming two heart attacks and battled depression to build an instantly recognisable brand. Brown and his staff deserve every success ndash you can only hope they rise again.However, itrsquos the use of the word lsquoartrsquo when it comes to Brown and his business which troubles me. Is this really Scottish art  If so, what does it say about Scotland  In fact, what does it say about the west  Therersquos little dference substantively when it comes to the cultures of Scotland, England, America, Australia and the rest of the anglophone countries. Culturally wersquore synced.:Steven Brown Art firm goes into liquidation with loss of  jobsArt should affect your soul. Art, in all its forms ndash music, literature, painting, sculpture, dance, cinema ndash should make you see the world in a new way, should illuminate some thought or feeling inside you that yoursquove never experienced before, art should let you look through another personrsquos eyes, art should change you. Art should make you angry, scared, elated, aroused ndash it should grab hold of your heart and mind and shake up the emotional world in which you live. Art should tell you truths you didnrsquot know or were too scared to learn. Art should make you feel awe, pity, wonderment. It should renew you and nourish you. Art should inspire and humble you.Does Brown do any of that  I feel his work is for people who neither like nor trust the idea of art. To me, Brownrsquos paintings are comfy. Brown provides prettiness and safety. Itrsquos a warm bath, and thatrsquos not art. Brownrsquos work is home decor, interior design. Itrsquos meant to make your living room attractive, not to touch your soul or change you.The irony is that while Brown may not be creating lsquoartrsquo, hersquos certainly reflecting culture. Our culture has become lsquocomfy-cosyrsquo, safe and unthreatening when it comes to art, literature and music. In that sense, Brown is entirely in keeping with a culture that doesnrsquot really value ideas.Therersquos a unormity about Brownrsquos art. Itrsquos there to fill a space ndash not in your heart, or soul, or mind ndash but on your wall. Therersquos also a grating ubiquity to Brownrsquos art, at least in Scotland. It fits with our mass-produced, mass-consumed culture. It sits easily alongside tribal tattoos, European city breaks, mindfulness, Love Island, Med holidays, Netflix and chill, retro breakfast cereal, breakfast for dinner, Ed Sheeran wedding songs, banter not a conversation, Sunday at the shopping mall, and arguments in Ikea. Itrsquos safe. Everyone does it. Itrsquos moribund.Itrsquos also understandable. Itrsquos not hard to work out why so many now chose cultural comfort rather than a cultural challenge. Our world is horrible. The news frightening. Bank accounts depleting. Hate festering. Progress offers only pain. Why not chose the equivalent of easy-listening when it comes to culture, rather than something which unsettles or questions you.:Neil Mackay: Why the Plan B path to independence reveals a world of pain for the SNPHowever,we wrap ourselves in a cultural comfort blanket wersquoll stagnate, calcy. Art is the hard abrasive necessary to keep culture on its toes, to fend off entropy.Wersquove ceased to exist lsquoinsidersquo culture. Now we lsquoconsumersquo culture from without. For something to be consumed it must be easily digestible. No wonder that bland art is called pablum ndash gruel made for weaning infants. And our lsquoartrsquo is infantilising us.Think of music. The common theme in so much mainstream music is \"yoursquore great, you can do it, the world will love you, success waits around the corner\". Le is a constant summer festival and sooner or later yoursquore going to take to the main stage. Literature has been reduced to what supermarket buyers think a good book is ndash a -page pitch for a B movie thatrsquoll never get made. Cinema is a repeating rhythm of superheroes.Mattel is creating a Barbie dressed as David Bowiersquos Ziggy Stardust for the adult market. Grown-ups queue to see Toy Story. No wonder. Wersquove made children of ourselves. Wersquore all guilty of it.Of course, great music, literature and cinema is still being made, but itrsquos increasingly pushed to the fringes, while the centre-ground keeps growing. Irsquom not saying therersquos no place for mere entertainment, and everything should be high art. Irsquom saying that the middle of the road is now the only path to travel.So much of culture is now like a recurring meme, reflecting how the digital rather than the artistic is now the great cultural driver. Perhaps, the meme is the biggest cultural development of late. Brownrsquos art is meme-like ndash he repeats the same images over and over. The simpler it is, the more wersquoll buy it.Our lsquocomfyrsquo culture makes even discussing such issues dficult. To subject Brown to scrutiny as his company fails will be seen by many as cruel instead of what it is: a timely assessment of someone with a position in Scottish culture. To wonder what people see in paintings like McCoo ndash to suggest money may be better spent on a good print from an art store ndash is to risk being labelled an elitist snob. What could be worse in our cosy anti-intellectual society But Brown should be subjected to scrutiny as he affects Scottish culture and how itrsquos perceived. His images of cows with Saltires on their horns are seen by the world as saying something about Scotland. To me, it risks saying that wersquore a sentimental and frivolous people. That we remain in our tartan shortbread tin. Itrsquos art for the kailyard.Our country brims with great artists of all disciplines.

Donald Trumprsquos racism is about as subtle as his quf and always has been. But increasingly we are seeing Republicans delight in his racist tirades: his approval ratings among party members rose by five per cent in the wake of the tweets. A president whorsquoll boot political correctness to kingdom come  They couldnrsquot get enough of him.In three years, Mr Trump has transformed the Republicans from the big tent party of Reagan and Bush, into a suspicious, mistrustful, angry sect. He has torn off the veneer and revealed the seething resentment underneath. He has revelled in it and is now seeking to use it to propel himself all the way back to the White House.And he has done this almost entirely with words. Simplistic, inaccurate, often downright absurd words. Petulant words. Self-pitying words. Words that, in their very inarticulacy, resonate deeply with voters alienated by the high-flown oratory of Barack Obama. Words that respect no boundaries. If Mr Trump is an iconoclast, then political correctness is lying smashed at his feet.Will it be mourned  Well, it certainly should, because without it, we are sliding back to the s. In the UK too, where the Prime Minister-in-waiting Boris Johnson has bated Muslims just to endear himself to an increasingly radicalised Tory Party membership, considered speech can no longer be taken for granted, even at the highest levels of politics in its place is polemic and sneering derision.It is tempting to argue that the PC police had gone too far, that nursing hurt feelings had become a full-time occupation for some and that public officials were taking matters too far. Perhaps. Banning all religious references in childrenrsquos ldquoChristmas plays is one example. But snagging on these passing headlines is to miss the bigger picture and the real signicance of this phenomenon: language is one of the only weapons against hate that we have. If we abandon kind and respectful language, then vicious words and deeds will surely follow. Itrsquos already happening.In the st century, political correctness has been co-opted as a term of abuse to dismiss anyone, particularly those advocating for women, the disabled, ethnic minorities, transgender people or other traditionally marginalised groups, who suggest that we should exercise some thought about the words that spew from our lips. As such, it is a source of the most volcanic irritation for many people. Yoursquove heard the sort of thing. They donrsquot see why they shouldnrsquot be allowed to say what they want Britain is a free country isnrsquot it  Frankly they wouldnrsquot be at all surprisedthere was an EU regulation outlawing the habit of calling waitresses ldquolove. And in fairness, like many of us, they are afraid of inadvertently falling foul of the rules and being branded a bigot for getting the terminology wrong. But at its heart, political correctness upsets people because examining the words we use and the assumptions we make about others forces us to confront our knee jerk beliefs about them. And those might not be quite as kindly as wersquod like to think.That is why it matters. Anyone can incubate prejudice without meaning to after all many of us, to some extent, live in a bubble, whether racial or social or economic. It does no harm to examine our beliefs from time to time.We just need to relax about it. After all, most of us exercise political correctness in our personal lives every single day.Because what is being PC except editing the thoughts that spring to your mind before they exit your mouth, so as not to cause unnecessary hurt  Itrsquos just showing consideration by another name. We all do it all the time. Most of us, seeing a friend in the street, would resist the temptation to comment on her expanding girth. Mothers and fathers donrsquot usually tell their kids that their singing is a bit rubbish. Wersquove all received gts that have made our hearts sink but only a truly malevolent soul would drop the china unicorn into the bin right in front of Auntie Sue. We exercise self-control to protect other peoplersquos sense of self-worth. And extending that courtesy to strangers helps to protect them in the same way in an increasingly hostile world.Some see all this as a veneer, arguing that kind words donrsquot necessarily denote kind thoughts.Undeniably. But kindness and consideration in our language, when all public figures adhere to the same rules, provide a sort of herd immunity by making it socially unacceptable to voice your darkest impulses in public. When this consensus is abandoned by the likes of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, the prejudice lurking beneath is validated and the bigotry normalised.Mr Trump and Mr Johnson, who both spin themselves as honest and open, are in truth cynical and manipulative. Mr Trump knows that endorsing racial prejudice will galvanise his supporters and might win over some Democrats in marginal states, and Mr Johnson has been playing a Tory membership that believes overwhelmingly that parts of the UK are under Sharia law.The invasion of the public space with racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTI views ndash views that some of us had dared believe were in terminal decline in supposedly advanced democracies like Britain and the US ndash is a reminder that progress is not linear.The property mogul from New York has gloried in abandoning the consensus around measured, respectful language.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"unique fitness class comes to inverurie","story":"A dynamic fitness class called the Hour of Power is coming to Inverurie this summer.The Hour of Power is a full body conditioning workout that pushes you to reach your fitness limits, combining cardiovascular exercise with resistance training and incorporates elements of yoga and pilates alongside the discipline of mental focus.HOP instructor and personal trainer , Angie Michie, said: “It’s uncomplicated choreography and minimal use of equipment appeals to men and women alike and is suitable for all fitness levels.” Hour of Power Aberdeenshire holds the unique position of being the only active class in Scotland, and whilst immensely popular in England the class hasn’t been long established in Aberdeenshire.Angie started training with the DVD, to complement her endurance training but enjoyed the no nonsense style of the workout so much she was inspired to become an instructor.Incorporating HOP into her training has enabled her to achieve fitness goals that were unimaginable just a few years ago such as completing the Coast to Coast and Etape Royale.The HOP has been changing peoples lives for four decades and was pioneered in the ’s by Dragan Radovic.His sons Rajko and Luka established Fitness x Ltd, the organisation behind this unique x training method and continue to inspire and support the HOP community around the world.Free taster sessions will be held on Thursday  and Wednesday  July at pm in Tesco Community room.For more details or to book a place in the classes please contact Angie on  .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amPolice are appealing for information after a car was damaged at the Lidl carpark in Kirkwall on Monday, June .

Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “HIAL’s commitment to access for all passengers has been recognised for a third year by the CAA, acknowledging the hard work by all our staff to ensure our airports are as inclusive as possible.#As an organisation, we work with local disability organisations and iniduals to ensure we are always improving our offerings to better meet their needs and provide assistance where required.“For Kirkwall to be listed as Very Good in its first year of reaching the required passenger threshold is a testament to the hard work staff put in to accommodate disabled and mobility restricted passengers.“Kirkwall has made several upgrades to its facilities for those with additional needs in recent years including changing the flooring in the security area from carpet to lino and adding additional counter space in disabled toilets.“We continue to invest and improve and will provide staff with additional disabilities training.#The CAA’s framework was introduced to ensure there is a consistent and high-quality service for disabled passengers across UK airports. The CAA assesses airports against a number of measures to establish how well they are performing for disabled passengers.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Fty years later, it stands as arguably the greatest achievement of the th century and a testament to human endeavour and perseverance. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent just under  hours on the Moon, including more than two hours of field work at the lunar surface. Meanwhile, Michael Collins circled the Moon in the ­command module, perhaps best-positioned to contemplate the meaning of le or our place in the universe.Down at the lunar surface, ­Armstrong and Aldrin performed several experiments, but arguably their most important task was to collect the first ever samples of Moon rock. Apollo  ed  kg of lunar samples to Earth. It was to be the first time that scientists were able to analyse Moon rocks in Earth-based laboratories and set in motion a series of discoveries that continues to this day. Over the past decade, I have been extremely fortunate to lead several projects working on Apollo samples at The Open University. Thanks to the Apollo astronauts and the curators at NASA, researchers such as myself – who weren’t even born when the Apollo Moon landings took place – are still able to study Moon rocks and feel part of a shared historical ­adventure.As the world celebrates the th anniversary of the Apollo  landing, The Open University also celebrates its th anniversary. By sheer coincidence, The Open University was awarded its Royal Charter just three months before the first Moon landing, heralding a new era, not just in space exploration, but also in higher education. Not surprisingly perhaps, The Open University has championed space research for most of its existence. We are very proud of our continuing leadership in this global endeavour. Indeed, it has been very exciting to be involved in the theory-changing ­discovery of water in Moon rocks, which had been thought to be devoid of water for almost four ­decades since the first samples were analysed in . Over the past decade, my team at The Open University have been undertaking cutting-edge laboratory research to look for water – and other associated elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen – in Moon rocks. Our findings suggest the presence of a water reservoir in the Moon which is similar to certain parts inside the Earth’s structure. Furthermore, the distinctive chemical composition of the water in the lunar samples points towards water in the Moon having a common origin with that of the Earth and asteroids. Despite these Apollo samples ­having been collected  years ago, this field of research remains active, as many new questions have ­arisen through recent findings. Some of these new questions can only be addressed effectively by ing to the Moon with custom-built instruments to perform experiments insitu, followed by missions ing samples from areas of the Moon that were not visited by the Apollo ­missions. As water is a key commodity and a precious resource for supporting space exploration – it is required for le support and can be used in radiation protection and rocket fuel – finding water on the Moon has reignited interest beyond traditional space powers and a new ‘Moon Rush’ has begun – just look at the number of new spacefaring nations and private entities targeting the Moon. New research will explore the possibility of building habitats on the Moon. The availability of water on the Moon will play a vital part in realising our bold ambition of living there in the not too distant future. As we look forward to the next  years of space exploration, we must acknowledge the contributions countless iniduals made towards the success of what was once an unimaginable dream, of landing humans on another planetary ­surface. Just as the members of the ­Armstrong clan in Dumfries and ­Galloway several centuries ago couldn’t know that one of their descendants would walk on the Moon, we must continue to inspire and engage the future Neil ­Armstrongs of the world who will realise the dream of extending humanity’s presence to the Moon and beyond in a safe and sustainable manner.Dr Mahesh Anand is a reader in planetary science and exploration at The Open University.

The rebels fear this will happenthe new Prime Minister – ie Boris Johnson – is unable to muster enough votes from MPs to allow a no-deal Brexit, which is what will happen unless there is a breakthrough in the EU talks or a further delay.That’s the same no deal which, according to the Government’s own advisors, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will push the UK into a recession and force the Government to almost double public borrowing next year to £ billion, with an even bigger debt mountain to follow in -.: Brexit: MPs vote to block suspension of parliament to force through no-dealThe rebels don’t want Parliament to be suspended because this would mean they would be unable to bring down the Government, forcing a general election at which the people of Britain would be able to vote for candidates who support or oppose a monumentally foolish no-deal Brexit. A Government suspending democracy to avoid losing a vote in the Commons and a vote by the country, so that it can force through a policy that will trash the UK economy  Pardon  This rebellion was odd only because it was necessary.But Jeremy Hunt, the other candidate in the one-horse race to be next Conservative leader, managed to add an extra touch of the surreal when he accidentally failed to vote – while stressing he would have voted with the Government because it would be wrong, he claimed, for Parliament to “restrict the hand of an incoming Government in this way”. Just to be clear, his stated position is that it would be wrong to suspend Parliament and he wouldn’t do thatelected leader. So Hunt would have voted to allow something he doesn’t approve of, but didn’t.Four other Cabinet ministers, including the Chancellor Philip Hammond, also didn’t vote, but appear to have not done so deliberately, helping the rebels to win a vote that blocks suspension of Parliament – although only while there is no devolved government in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, Johnson waved a kipper about to make a probably inaccurate point about EU regulations.

It’s a definite maybe from the First Minister!Notwithstanding his attempt to eat his words, he had been caught off guard, and had said what a growing number of people believe to be true: independence is a question of when, not .Since the European referendum in , people across Wales have seen the Westminster parties tie themselves in knots over what version of Brexit they want to push through.: Gordon Brown launches think tank with warning Boris Johnson could end Union: Benelux could be model for Scotland, Wales and England after independence, says Plaid Cymru leaderThis chaos has been a plague on the houses of both Labour and the Tories, and more and more people are looking on in horror, questioning whether this really is as good as it gets.But of course, the truth is this didn’t start in June . It started long before then, with a depressing democratic deficit which sees the interests of both Wales and Scotland side-lined.That the interests of the peoples of our two nations, and indeed the wills of our respective parliaments, can be ignored in favour of Westminster’s own interests is no new phenomenon.It is, sadly, a part of le in this United Kingdom.Indeed, it was the democratic deficit itself which drove Brexit itself. The result of the first European referendum was, in my view, the wrong answer to the right question. The question being: why are our voices not being heard by the powers that be What the past three years have shown is that the land of milk and honey promised by the leaders of the Leave campaign was never possible. Indeed, any version of Brexit would wreak unimaginable damage on Wales and Scotland, risking thousands of jobs and crucial investment in our communities.That risk increases exponentially when the next British Prime Minister takes office next week. If, as expected, Boris Johnson does indeed become Prime Minister, the occupant of  Downing Street will be a man who relishes the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.He is a man who has talked openly about cutting Scottish spending and seizing control of regional economic policy – rather than allowing spending decisions affecting Wales and Scotland to be made in our respective countries.Let us be in no doubt that these are very serious times which require all of us to think very seriously and soberly about the kind of future we want for our nations.The choice we face has rarely been starker. On the one hand, the insular, narrow nationalism of the British establishment and its obsession with delivering a nightmare Brexit come hell or high water. And on the other, a bright, prosperous future as independent nations at the heart of Europe.I know what I would prefer.More and more people are realising the sad truth that the current set up of the United Kingdom is incapable of serving either of our nations well.One such person is, of course, the de facto Deputy Prime Minister David Lidington, who penned a memo which said that Wales feels “failed” by Westminster. Indeed, he said that “we cannot be complacent about Wales’s attitude to the Union and independence”.His answer  To improve the “branding” on the few projects in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that are funded by the UK Government.He sees that Westminster has failed us. He sees the series of infrastructure projects cancelled. He sees the fiscal gap. And yet he fails to do anything to remedy the situation.His shallow response exposes the contempt in which the British establishment holds our two nations. ‘Slap a union flag on it,’ he might as well have said, ‘that’ll pacy them’.Post-independence, our closest friends and allies will always be the other nations of the former UK, but let us not be fooled into thinking that the UK as it stands is a partnership of equals. It isn’t.In a speech in Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago, I proposed that the independent nations of Wales, Scotland and England adopt a model of cooperation based on the Benelux countries.That would be a kind of post-independence union – a voluntary association of sovereign nations, sitting above each independent nation. It could include shared institutions such as a parliament, council of ministers, and court, all in addition to the respective national institutions.Such a model would foster a more equal and congenial partnership between our nations than could ever be possible within the United Kingdom.When Wales and Scotland do choose an independent future – and it is only a matter of when – I also happen to believe England would benefit from an equal partnership as much as our two countries.This ongoing Brexit psychodrama has put the UK on hold: standing still, rudderless, without effective government. It is fraying, not just at the edges, but right through its body politic. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is moving on.This won’t go on much longer. People can only take so much before they choose a dferent, better path. For both our countries, that path can only lead to one future: independence. It’s just a matter of a time, but it’s coming very, very quickly.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again.

If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

During the debate on the Northern IrelandBill, the DUPs Westminster leader Nigel Dodds claimed the norms of devolution are being eroded. He said: \"What we see is the setting aside of every parliamentary norm, every norm about consultation and consideration. \"The reality is we are being very, very selective to legislate on some of the most contentious and isive issues on which there is no consensus, but leave aside hundreds of other issues on which there is consensus and which there is a common-sense approach that there should be action taken. \"So why dont we have direct rule and legislate on all these issues or respect devolution  \"You cant have it both ways, and I think we are running very close to the time where that clear choice will have to be made.\" The revised amendment was brought forward in the Lords yesterday to address \"technical problems\" with the change to legislation approved by the Commons on Monday. Terminations in Northern Ireland are only allowed in cases where a womans le is at risk orthere is a danger of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. DUP MP Ian Paisley said the Bill had been \"hijacked\" by MPs pursuing their own \"pet subjects\". He said: \"It has been hijacked and used as a vehicle for every other subject under the sun. \"It is wrong that Northern Ireland is now going to be subjected to serious and perverse changes to their laws without proper scrutiny, without proper negotiation, without proper regulation.\" Mr Paisley said these were \"the most extreme laws that will ever affect anyone in the whole of the United Kingdom with regards to abortion... laws that are prohibited in this part of the United Kingdom but that members will inflict on our part of the United Kingdom in order to make a cheap political point\". Conservative MP Fiona Bruce called for Northern Irish politicians to be able to take decisions on these issues. She said: \"Let them decide on such sensitive issues. \"We talk here about the importance of not being colonial.

The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It includes ways in which the laity could be more active in their parishes and carry out duties traditionally done by the clergy.The developments were reported in the Ulster Herald.Fr Paul McCafferty, the vicar general of the Derry Diocese, told the Herald: \"Bishop Donal McKeown has initiated discussions around a pastoral vision and how to accommodate it around the fact that there will be a smaller number of priests.\"It is important to stress that this is still at the very early stages of consideration and is a medium-term project for the diocese. The models will also ensure that inidual parishes retain their identity.\"One of the models would mean one parish priest covering a number of dferent parishes, he explained.The second would see a group of priests coming together to share responsibilities around dferent parishes.Fr McCafferty added: \"In each model the aim is to ensure we continue to do our very best for all our parishioners and their parishes. At the moment we are simply exploring these options but the reality is, things are changing fundamentally due to reduced number of priests.\"Bishop McKeown outlined in the God is Love document the way in which the drop in priests could be addressed.He said: \"As each parish community develops its own capability it can take responsibility for pastoral priorities and take the first steps towards addressing those priorities, whether using their own resources or working co-operatively with neighbouring parishes.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38323908.ece/41bb8/AUTOCROP/w620/GOLF%20Open%200641_2.jpg","title":"the open thousands flock to the fairways but alls quiet on portrush streets as retailers bank on late business","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

MPs defeated the Government on an amendment which could prevent him proroguing Parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit.Four Cabinet ministers including Chancellor Philip Hammond abstained and  Tory MPs rebelled in the vote.Mr Swann said his party believed no-deal would be disastrous for Northern Ireland.He said: \"Politicians who suggest otherwise are living in cloud cuckoo land. The EU needs a deal, and so does the UK.\"However, given the political impasse in Parliament, it looks increasingly like the only way out may be a general election, which is a gamble the new Prime Minister will be tempted to take.\"But it will be another shot in the dark in the hope of clearing the Brexit logjam.\"The DUP said that the Commons vote was \"designed to weaken the hand\" of the next Prime Minister.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime.

We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances. It will be an emotional day for us all. It’s not just about me, there were many hundreds of families with stories to tell but maybe I told mine a bit more forcefully.”In the coming days a crane will lt the one-third scale replica of a Nissan hut into place which were originally constructed out of iron welded together and covered in corrugated tin sheets.In , over  residents from the camp marched on the city’s Guildhall to lodge their complaints about their living conditions with the leaders of the old Londonderry Corporation as part of a long running battle with the former local authority.Willie Deery continued: “There is a famous Derry Journal photograph from November  when women from the camp marched on the Guildhall in protest after a fire. The mother’s in that picture are all gone but we are going to recreate that photo with their daughter’s standing in the same formation as the original picture.”CAPTION: An artists impression of what the monument to Springtown camp will look like after its installed."},{"url":null,"title":"statistics reveal missed targets department concedes ambulance service currently resourced","story":"The department of health has conceded that the current level of demand on the ambulance service exceeds available resources.The ambulance service has been dealing with a surge in emergency calls over recent years.Newly published Department of Healthstatistics reveal that between   and  , the number of emergency calls received by the NIAS increased by , from , to ,.In   the Western Local Commissioning Groupalone, which takes in Derry, received , calls – almost  a day.Aside from the Belfast LCG, the ambulance service in the Western area received the highest number of calls in the past year based on per ,-population.Category A calls are immediately le threatening and receive the NIAS’s highest priority with a performance target of arriving at .% of these calls within  minutes.During the last five years in NI, the percentage of Category A calls responded to within  minutesdecreased from .% in   to .% in  In   all LCGs fell well below this target, with the Western Trust the second-best performer at just .%.From December  to March  the performance across Northern Ireland has deteriorated. Most LCGs recorded percentages below  while the Western Trust consistently registered a score below % during that period, something that hadnt happened in the eight months prior.Category B are serious but not le-threatening calls and require a response within  minutes and category C calls are neither le threatening or serious and require a response within  minutes.Over the past year % of journeys in the Western area were deemed emergencies while the rest were non-emergencies.‘Competing priorities’In response to claims that the ambulance cover in Derry is insufficient and the service in general is facing serious funding pressures, the department of health said it looks to the NIAS to ensure that sufficient ambulance cover is provided throughout NI.A spokeswoman explained: \"The Department recognises that demand for ambulance services is currently outstripping the available resources.\"We are currently considering the outcome of a public consultation by NIAS on a new clinical response model whichintroduced will ensure that that the most ill patients requiring an ambulance will be seen quickly as well as improving the overall efficiency of response times.”She continued: \"This new service model will require signicant investment which will have to be found within the Department’s budget against other competing priorities for investment in health and social care services.\"Ahead of decisions to be taken on the new service model later this year the Department has committed to putting more paramedics on the ground and is funding  training places from its transformation fund.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod wells carnival 2019 hundreds","story":"The best overall float and winner of the Gordon Phillips Cup was Underhill Ridinltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtg Stables with the Pltspan classtruncate-full-screengtony Clubrsquos th Birthday celebrations also this year.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap.

Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

Ballynahinch is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular and we need to see work on the bypass starting as soon as possible, he said.Cllr Walker argued that the current congestion is hampering new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and believes the provision of the new bypass represents a ldquowin win for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down close in on last four  ","story":"DOWN camogs took another step towards qualication for the semi-finals when they blitzed Carlow at Pairc Esler on Saturday afternoon.The home side started in a hurry and stormed into a - to - interval lead, Carlowrsquos only scores coming from two pointed frees.Down were strong in all departments, but they had the star of the show in Portaferryrsquos Niamh Mallon, who helped herself to -, with only three points coming from frees.Mallon received great support from Castlewellanrsquos Sorcha McCartan who helped set Down on their way with a cracking goal in the th minute to put her side - to - clear.Mallon grabbed Downrsquos second goal just after the break and a double from Catherine McGourty was the icing on the cake as the Downmanagement team emptied their bench.The only negative on the day came when Sara Louise Carr had to leave the action in the first half with what appeared to be a calf injury and she must now be a serious doubt for the big game with Derrry on July .Down sit top of their group alongside Tipperary with Derry only a point behind and a win against their Ulster rivals would surely secure a place in the last four.Down -Carlow -ALL-IRELAND ICC.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C July 17%2C 1979  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN mdash Stormont officials were keeping tight-lipped this week about the prospect of finding new employment for  workers who have been dramatically paid off at two textile factories in the Castlewellan area.Redundancy notices went sent out last week to employees of the Moss Lane Spinning Company in Castlewellan and Standard Mills of Annsborough mdash but there is a chance they may be re-employedmoves to attract a new company to the vacated premises are successful.The official receiver, Mr Noel Stewart, who is the man heading the search for a new owner, said the two factories mdash operating as a joint company mdash had been plagued by ldquocatastrophic losses during the last  months.He stressed that he was optimistic that a new owner will be found and said the Department of Commerce had indicated that it will give every assistance to get the factories open again.A spokesman for the Department would only say that efforts were being made to get factories re-opened, but would not state the level of success.ldquoWe are trying to get another company to move into the premises at Castlewellan and Annsborough, but I am not prepared to say more than that at the moment, he said.Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill, slammed the decision to close the factories and said it was a disaster for the area.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted immediate action to cope with the grim unemployment problem facing the people of Castlewellan and Annsborough.ldquoThe overall situation was poor before this dramatic turn of affairs, but the close of these two factories makes the situation disastrous, he said.ldquoThere is now no worthwhile employment opportunity on any reasonable scale in the area. This is a situation which calls for immediate action by all relevant government departments, public bodies and interested parties to encourage, promote and attract new employment to the area, he added.BRYANSFORD mdash On a day when there were ten separate attacks on Post Office property throughout the province, Bryansford Post Office was the target for a terrorist bomb and several post office cables in the area were cut.Last Tuesday the telephone operator received an anonymous callfrom a male at .am warning that a bomb had been planted at the post office.Local police went to the scene where they found that a booby-trap bomb had been left in a waste paper basket outside. An Army technical officer later arrived and the bomb was successfully defused.Around the same time Post Office cables were cut at Dromara Road and Castlewellan Road in Clough.NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastle would be overwhelmed by a wave of crime and vice during the holiday period proved unfounded, with the resort enjoying an ldquoextremely quiet period.The RUC said before the Twelfth holidays began that they would be swamping the provincersquos major holiday resorts, including Newcastle, in a bid to crack down on the growing problems of teenage drinking and drug-taking.Newcastle had no major incidents or arrests, except for four Belfast youths who are helping police with their inquiries into shoplting at the Gt House of Mourne on July .A police spokesman stressed, however, that patrols were stepped up during the holiday period, especially during weekends, chiefly because the population of the resort doubled during the summer months.Police said violence was the most common side effect of teenage drinking and they had asked publicans, off licence owners and hotels to be extra vigilant.The spokesman added that the police determination to crack down could only succeed with the help of the people who sold the drink.KILLYLEAGH mdash The Dunmore Hotel in Killyleagh changed hands over the holiday period and it may also be changing its name. The new owners are Mr Paul Green and his we Nancy, from Killinchy, and they have taken over the hotel from Mr Harry Briggs.The hotel was sold for an undisclosed sum of money, but it is believed to be in six figures. The new owners intend to extend and renovate the hotel, but hope that all work can be carried out without closing down the hotel.The short term plans include adding nine new bedrooms at the rear and extensively renovating the present accommodation.The owners intend to keep the present name for the time being, but they are contemplating reverting to the original name of the hotel, lsquoThe Treesrsquo.STRANGFORD mdash Shore sports proved every bit as popular as the sailing events at Strangford Regatta last week.Hundreds of holidaymakers flocked to the village to watch people of all age groups taking part in a host of events in the hot summer sun.The wide spectrum of events made it a day of fierce competition and fun for competitors and spectators alike and the organisers say they were amazed at the success of the sporting programme.Events included a fancy dress competition, round the houses race, rowing race and races for married men and women. Amusements were also provided for the children.PORTAFERRY mdash The Strangford to Portaferry swim was one of the highlights of Portaferry Gala Week, which began on Sunday and continues through until Saturday.The swim against the current, which is believed to be one of the fastest in Europe, took the most out of all eight competitors, who ranged in age from  to .But for Jacqui McIntyre, of Bangor Swimming Club, the swim proved comparatively easy.

It concludes this Saturday with the final of the talent competition and an open air dance.MOURNES mdash The Mourne Mountains are alive to the sound of music mdash music with a message which is about building bridges across the world.The area was the cockpit for an international roadshow arranged and rehearsed at break-neck speed around camp fires.

He is absolutely devastated..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “On the Wednesday afternoon there was an deluge or rain that came down around pm and we had to dash from the back of the th hole to the spectator village. It was after that he realised he must have dropped the flag and let out an absolute almighty scream.“He ran back immediately in the direction he had been but no joy unfortunately. He was in bits afterwards. His two brothers still have their signed flags and have been trying to console him.“We now have another flag which we are working on getting autographed, but it is obviously the championship days now and the players aren’t signing as much as they were on the practice days. We have managed to get a few autographs, but none of the big guys so far.“So while Ben will have a souvenir at the end of it, he is disappointed that it won’t be the one he had put all that work into.”Ian took to Twitter in the hopes that someone had spotted the missing flag and couldit safely to its rightful owner.“I am not expecting miracles, it was just on the off chance that someone had come across it,” he added.\u2028“We have had some very kind offers of help from people on social media, including a management company who have said they will try and get him something signed by some of their players. It is very nice and very much appreciated. “If someone manages to get the flag back to us it would be amazing and would restore my faith in humanity.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
