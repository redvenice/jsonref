Asked if hospitals could end up overwhelmed, he said: \u0027I think that that is a very real possibility.\u0027If the numbers of infections increasing continues in the way that it has done, and it spills out into older age groups, then we could see numbers of people being admitted to hospital getting very large and certainly going over the 1,000, maybe up to 2,000 a day, that we\u0027ve managed to keep the Delta variant below.\u0027It was sort of below 1,000 since July without any restrictions, but I think that is going to be very, very difficult or are very unlikely to happen.\u0027Pressed on the possibility of the NHS being overwhelmed next month, the expert said: \u0027I think so, there is that possibility.\u0027It\u0027s very hard to be certain about these things. You certainly can\u0027t put a risk or probability on them, but that is one of one of the more likely things that could happen.\u0027Professor Medley said \u0027the numbers of boosters has gone up enormously\u0027 but it is the \u0027concertina-ing effect which is the biggest danger\u0027.He said there have been around 800 hospital admissions per day for the past five months but \u0027if we\u0027d had all those in one month then we would have had a very different experience and the NHS would have been extremely taxed.\u0027He added: \u0027And that is the fear - that we end up with the next four months of the epidemic in one month.\u0027Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the Government\u0027s position, saying ministers believe Plan B includes \u0027sensible proportionate steps, which, combined with getting the booster jab, we think will be the right approach to take.\u0027He told the Today programme that the Government is saying that \u0027we\u0027re in a much better position to enjoy Christmas than we were last year\u0027, adding that taking tests before gatherings is a sensible move, as well as getting boosters.Elsewhere, Professor Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol and a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast the wave of Omicron is just taking off across the country.He said: \u0027The wave is coming very fast and in fact alarmingly fast - if anything faster than ever. So it really is a race at the moment.\u0027The more immunity that we\u0027ve all got the less of a problem this is going to be, but I\u0027m afraid it is going to be a serious problem either way.\u0027Prof Finn said it is not up to him to say what regulations should be put on the population, but added: \u0027I think I can certainly encourage people to do everything they can to minimise spread of the virus during this critical period and, of course, a lot of that can be done voluntarily without anyone imposing rules on people.\u0027We all know now what the things are that we can do. We can avoid social contact, we can minimise contact at work, we can wear masks and really importantly, do lateral flow tests and check that you aren\u0027t showing signs of infection on a test before you go into a crowded place where you might infect other people.\u0027Prof Finn said he is \u0027very concerned\u0027 about the current number of daily infections, adding that we are \u0027going to see the numbers of people becoming ill and needing hospital care beginning to rise steadily now over the next week and maybe over Christmas as well.\u0027But he said boosters take effect in the body quickly, adding: \u0027It does come through very fast because you\u0027ve got immunological memory, you\u0027ve seen the antigen before from your previous doses, so the level of protection goes up pretty quick.\u0027Meanwhile, Professor Tim Spector, who helped found the Covid Zoe app, said Covid cases in London are accelerating more than was seen during the very first wave of the virus.He told the Today programme the \u0027majority of symptoms\u0027 of the Omicron variant are like a common cold, including headaches, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue and sneezing.He said: \u0027In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it\u0027s far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold.\u0027If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we\u0027ve seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant variant already.\u0027On Tuesday evening, new restrictions were approved in Parliament for face coverings at more indoor spaces in England and the introduction of NHS Covid passes for nightclubs and large venues.In Scotland, people have been urged to limit their mixing by socialising with only up to two other households indoors, while in Northern Ireland, politicians backed mandatory Covid certification for access to nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises."},{"url":null,"title":"Britons face spending Christmas Day isolation testing positive","story":"Share this article   Calls have been made for the introduction of further restrictions in the capital, with the super mutant variant now responsible for half of cases.The city is still the region of England with the fastest-growing Covid outbreak, according to Government data, with cases growing by up to 48 per cent a week in the worst-hit boroughs.NHS leaders said No10 needs to be prepared to introduce stricter curbs than the current Plan B if Omicron is on the brink of overwhelming the NHS.Mr Johnson warned his Cabinet this morning that a \u0027huge spike\u0027 of Omicron is coming, according to Downing Street. Dominic Raab risked inflaming the tensions in interviews as he dismissed \u0027overstated\u0027 criticism about the measures to combat the Omicron strain. Ministers are said to be examining plans for a further round of restrictions in England that would push it closer towards a lockdown and are sure to watch Ms Sturgeon\u0027s announcement with interest and trepidation.Meanwhile Britain\u0027s booster drive to beat the Omicron super-variant has been mired in chaos after more than 4.4million attempts were made to book top-up shots on the NHS website and furious GPs warned they had run out of doses.Health chiefs said 545,000 appointments were secured by 8pm last night, even after the website crashed because so many people logged on.

Photograph: Michaela Handrek-RehleBloombergGPs and pharmacies have been told they can start administering booster vaccines to everyone aged 16 and over, though they should continue to prioritise older and more vulnerable patients.In a significant acceleration of the booster programme, the HSE has told GPs and pharmacies they it will be providing immediate support to allow them meet the likely surge in demand.At present, boosters are being administered to people aged 50 and over, residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities and those aged 16 and over with an underlying condition or who work in health.Under new rules, the HSE has told GPs and pharmacies they may now “in next order of priority” offer boosters to pregnant women aged 16 and over, people aged 40-49 years and people aged 16-39 year in descending order by 10-year age cohort (30-39, 20-29 and 16-19 years).GPs offering booster doses are to set aside routine works for the next two weeks as part of the plans to accelerate rollout, according to Dr Denis McCauley, chair of the GP committee of the Irish Medical Organisation. Doctors will continue to deal with urgent cases.HSE managers are due to contact inidual GP surgeries and pharmacies over the coming days to ensure they have sufficient stocks.Deliveries of extra supplies are expected to take place from Friday up to Thursday, December 23rd.Pharmacies have been told they can have a “one off unscheduled delivery” to provide them with sufficient stocks to last 30 days.Family doctors have been told they can vaccinate all adults while “at all times trying to prioritise the medically vulnerable and the older age groups as much as is practical”, according to Dr McCauley.Urging people to put a booster “on their Christmas list”, he said patients should check with the website of their practice for an update on how to access a shot. Some patients would be contacted by their doctor but others may be able to make online appointments.‘Tired but willing’He said doctors were “tired but willing” to do their bit to ensure as many people get a booster as possible.Dr McCauley said removing the requirement for people to wait 15 minutes after vaccination would allow GPs double the number of patients they could give boosters to.The HSE has told pharmacies to prioritise patients for boosters by age, while opening up access to dose for those aged 16 and over, according to Darragh O’Loughlin, secretary general of the Irish Pharmacy Union. Booster shots are being offered in 700 pharmacies this week, up from 550 last week and 470 the week before. This is still short of the 1,000 pharmacies that took part in the original vaccine rollout, but Mr O’Loughlin said he hoped to match this number early in the new year.There are about 1,900 pharmacies in the State.Earlier IT issues that prevented communications between the databases of people vaccinated in pharmacies and those attending HSE vaccination centres have been resolved, Mr O’Loughlin said. Information about a person receiving a booster in a pharmacy is now transferred to the HSE system within minutes so duplication of effort is avoided.Pharmacies administered 10,000 boosters on Tuesday, and 45,000 last week, up from 17,500 two weeks earlier.December is the busiest time of the year for pharmacies, he pointed out, and outlets will continue to dispense prescriptions while also administering booster shots.The IPU has asked the Department of Health to allow pharmacy students administer vaccines as part of the acceleration of the programme.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron variant is spreading at unprecedented rate who chief says","story":"The Omicron variant has now been reported by 77 countries and is probably present in most worldwide World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation, says Omicron should not be dismissed as ‘mild’. File photograph: Martial TrezziniEPAThe Omicron variant first detected in South Africa last month has now been reported by 77 countries and is probably present in most worldwide, but should not be dismissed as “mild”, World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,” the WHO director general told an online briefing on Tuesday. “Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.”Vaccine booster shots can play a role in curbing the spread of Covid-19 as long as people most in need of protection also get access to jabs, he also said.Also on Tuesday, global public health expert Dr Mike Ryan of the WHO said that the world cannot vaccinate or lock down its way out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme said continued public health measures were required as the Omicron variant would put pressure on health services, even if it was a milder disease.Speaking at an online webinar organised by the Institute of International and European Affairs, Dr Ryan said people have been looking for “silver bullets” or “unicorns” to end the pandemic, but they “don’t exist”.He said there needed to be a “multi-pronged” approach, in which consistent advice is delivered to the public.“What has worked during this pandemic is layered, risk-orientated, evidence-based, consistent advice to people. That’s the only way out of it. We can’t vaccinate our way out of this. We can’t lock down our way out of this,” he said.Dr Ryan said some countries have moved away from the basic health measures such as social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing.“Even if Omicron turns out to be a milder disease on an inidual basis, if we generate millions and millions and millions of cases, we will fill the hospitals up. We will fill the ICUs up,” he said.“We need to refocus on public health and social measures, vaccinate the unvaccinated. We need to make sure hospitals are ready.”Boosters should be administered to specific groups within the population, particularly older persons and people with underlying conditions.However, he said it was important to do both boosters and getting those who are unvaccinated vaccinated as quickly as possible.“That is the best use of the vaccine,” he added.Equitable accessOn the issue of equitable access for vaccines, Dr Ryan spoke about the Trips (Trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) waiver, which would temporarily waive patent rights to facilitate more widespread manufacturing worldwide.He said waiving technology rights “doesn’t necessarily make vaccines”, but said it must be viewed as a “global, strategic effort”.The WHO’s target was to have 40 per cent of the world vaccinated by the end of this year, but it is way off that, he said.“If a fire brigade goes to a fire today, it doesn’t distribute water on the basis of who can pay. It distributes that water based on whose house is burning, whose house is most at risk. We need a system that is much more coherent and we need technology transfer,” he said.Speaking in response to arguments that waiving the rights would have a negative impact on vaccine innovation in the future, Dr Ryan said it was public money that drove most of the investment.“There are extraordinary circumstances in which we really have to look at patents and intellectual property. When the patent for seatbelts was shared, Volvo didn’t go out of business,” he added.

Photograph: Conor O’MearainCollinsThe Capuchin Day Centre in Dublin, which provides meals and other services to people in need, has reported a significant increase in the numbers seeking vouchers for Christmas food hampers.The centre, on Bow Street in Smithfield, on Wednesday distributed vouchers to people who will collect their food hampers next week. “Between 6am-12pm today we gave out 2,600 vouchers,” the centre’s manager Alan Bailey said, adding that it would normally give out “about 2,000” tickets. “It’s the first year ever that this has happened. It’s a massive increase on previous years.” He said the numbers were in line with the additional demand the centre has experienced since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. People are not allowed inside the centre to eat meals at present due to coronavirus concerns but staff have continued providing take-away meals to those in need. The centre has also had to suspended the provision of showering facilities, clothing and haircuts because of Covid-19.“Normally we give out 550 dinners or so a day, but that’s gone up to 700 now since the start of the pandemic,” Mr Bailey said.Regarding the crowds that gathered in a long queue on Wednesday morning, Mr Bailey said he had “never seen anything like it”. The centre had planned to continue distributing tickets on Thursday and Friday. The hampers will be available to collect for those who have vouchers next Tuesday morning. The doors will open at about 8am and long queues of people are expected to arrive to collect fresh and dry food for the Christmas period. Separately, the Knights of St Columbanus, which organises an annual Christmas Day dinner for homeless people and others who are struggling, will not be hosting an in-person event this year. The dinner has in previous years taken place at the RDS in Dublin and was usually attended by more than 400 people. Those in attendance are usually given a three-course traditional Christmas dinner and toys are handed out to children. The event is now in its 97th year but due to the pandemic situation the organisers have said they will not be in a position to host the usual sit-down dinner.Instead, the Knights of St Columbanus will operate a pop-up mobile kitchen outside the Mansion House on Dawson Street on Christmas Day, between 10am and 1pm, where traditional meals will be available to take away.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireTánaiste Leo Varadkar said the Government will consider the recommendations and make a decision quickly. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillExpectation is growing in Government that new restrictions are likely to be recommended by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) at its meeting tomorrow.However, Ministers remain opposed to any suggestion that schools or hospitality businesses should close.The public health advisers are meeting to consider the threat from the fast-spreading Omicron variant and will send any recommendations for new restrictions to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly afterwards.Earlier today, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said he expected Nphet to recommend more restrictions on social mixing, close contacts and international travel.Mr Varadkar said the Government will consider the recommendations and make a decision quickly as speculation caused anxiety and he understood people wanted clarity and a few days’ notice rather than “worrying over the weekend”.If new restrictions are recommended by Nphet on Thursday, an urgent Cabinet meeting could be held on Friday, Mr Varadkar indicated, although Taoiseach Micheál Martin has departed to Brussels for a three-day EU summit beginning on Wednesday evening. “I would expect more recommendations around the management of close contacts, recommendations to decrease the amount of social mixing and recommendations around international travel,” Mr Varadkar told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny show.InfectionsSpeaking as he arrived in Brussels for the European Council meeting, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said testing before and after travel and prior to social activities will be key to tackling an expected rise in infections due to the Omicron variant.“The emphasis actually will be on more and more testing,” the Taoiseach said.“We’re going to be re-emphasising the importance of tests before you travel, tests after your travel, tests before you engage in social activity. All designed to protect your loved ones, protect yourself, and also you can participate that bit better then in whatever activity you are pursuing.”The challenge of the Omicron variant and how to boost vaccination rates in lagging member states is high on the agenda at the Council meeting. Ireland and Portugal were early movers in the European Union in re-introducing testing requirements before travel for vaccinated people, which had been broadly waived for those fully vaccinated travelling within the union.Italy this week announced it would introduce PCR testing requirements for all arrivals and five days of quarantine for non-vaccinated people, leading EU officials to warn that member states should coordinate travel rules and avoid “unilateral actions”.The Taoiseach said it was so far unclear whether Omicron would cause more serious health problems than previous variants, but that the clear advice was that the number of infections would rise.“We were winning the battle against Delta. The hospitals are down again today. And the likelihood is that they’ll go down for the next week, and ICUs. But now Omicron has arrived on the scene and the clear public health advices that it will spread more rapidly,” Mr Martin said.“The data is not there yet in respect of how severe its impact will be on health. The view is that the fact that we’re so well vaccinated will give us protection as a country, and that will give our people protection, but we have to be cautious about that,” he added.Evaluate “We always have to evaluate each phase of the pandemic, learn lessons from that and apply those lessons to the next phase. And this phase now is the ‘Omicron phase’.”The Taoiseach said a cabinet meeting had not been organised for Friday - something that would be expected if Nphet were to recommend new restrictions - but did not rule it out.Earlier, Mr Varadkar said although efforts to suppress the current high level of cases from the dominant Delta variant were “going well,” the Omicron strain – which appears to be more transmissible – was likely to cause an additional wave of infections in the next couple of weeks. This would require a “change in tack”, he said.Mr Varadkar’s comments come after a meeting between the leaders of the three Coalition parties and senior Nphet officials last night, at which the officials presented their assessment of the situation to the Ministers. Political sources said the leaders were anxious to ensure they were not surprised by Nphet recommendations on further restrictions, as has happened in recent weeks.Government figures have publicly and privately made clear they believe it is not necessary to close schools for an extended Christmas break, despite calls to do so, including from SolidarityPeople Before Profit TD Paul Murphy this morning.Mr Varadkar also said the pandemic was likely to “go on for several years” but added this did not mean that restrictions would be required for that period of time.ChildrenThe Tánaiste also said the details of how children would be vaccinated were being worked on. He said it would not be a requirement for children be vaccinated in order to attend school.“We will be encouraging parents to get their children vaccinated – it won’t be coercive,” he said.Whether or not any fresh restrictions are introduced will depend on a meeting of Nphet on Thursday, as the Government is likely to be reluctant to deviate from the guidance of chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and others.The Government has so far been hesitant to implement any major new restrictions to halt the spread of Covid-19 this Christmas and has instead focused on the rollout of booster vaccines to protest the population from the new Omicron variant.The number of GPs and pharmacists involved in administering booster vaccines is to be increased across the State as part of a “national effort” to prioritise vaccinations.Currently, 75 per cent of GPs are vaccinating the public. The Government now wants to get all GPs involved, as well as to double the number of pharmacies providing the booster jabs.Dr Mary Favier, Covid lead for the Irish College of General Practitioners, said the message from GPs to those awaiting a booster dose was: “don’t call us, we’ll call you”.The booster vaccines will be administered on an appointment basis with supplies being ordered on Wednesday, so it was likely to be next week before the campaign would commence in earnest.Dr Favier also said the 15-minute post-vaccine wait time was “a significant challenge” for GPs and “a big limiting step”. If removed, as had been done in the UK, it would allow GPs to vaccinate more patients, she said.Many vaccination centres will also have extended opening hours, from 8am to 8pm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"eu prepared to move unilaterally on ni medicines coveney says","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.

So look, I think we shouldn’t make a big deal of it, to be honest,” he said.“I think we have to go on what what David Frost says. He’s the chief negotiator he speaks for the prime minister on Brexit issues.”Before it was retracted, the dropping of the ECJ red line was heralded as an encouraging sign that a deal could be near, particularly as it was followed by the granting of 23 extra licences to French fishing boats by the UK government, easing tensions on another contentious issue.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson warned in recent months that it would use the sensitive article 16 clause to unilaterally suspend the enforcement of the post-Brexit arrangements designed to avoid a hard border unless concessions were granted, but subsequently appeared to move away from the idea."},{"url":null,"title":"russia hands security requests to us and hails support from china","story":" Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow holding a video-link meeting   with Chinese president Xi Jinping  on December 15th. Photograph:   Mikhail MetzelSPUTNIKAFPRussia has said China supports its bid to win binding security guarantees from the United States as it presented specific proposals on the issue to the US amid continuing western concern over Moscow’s military build-up close to Ukraine. Russia has responded to warnings from western powers not to escalate its aggression against Ukraine by claiming that its own safety is threatened by its neighbour’s bid to join Nato and by the alliance’s eastward expansion of recent decades.“American representatives were literally today handed concrete proposals in our foreign ministry that are aimed at developing legal security guarantees for Russia,” senior Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday.“We are ready to start negotiations on this crucial issue immediately,” he added, as US assistant secretary of state Karen Donfried met Russian foreign ministry and Kremlin officials in Moscow.Earlier Russian president Vladimir Putin held video talks with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, and both leaders hailed the deepening ties between their countries and criticised what they see as US attempts to dominate world affairs.Mr Ushakov said Mr Putin complained to Mr Xi about “mounting threats to Russia’s national interests from the US and the Nato bloc, which consistently move their military infrastructure close to Russia’s borders”.The Chinese leader “understands Russia’s concerns and fully supports our initiative to work out these security guarantees for Russia”, the adviser added.Mr Putin told his Chinese counterpart that Russia-China relations represented “a new model of co-operation...based, in part, on the principles of non-interference in each other’s affairs and mutual resolve to turn our common border into a belt of eternal peace and good-neighbourliness”.They also criticised US president Joe Biden’s recent “summit for democracy” – to which neither China nor Russia were invited – and relatively new US partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region: the so-called Quad that includes Japan, India, Australia and the US, and the Aukus security alliance between the US, Britain and Australia. Relations“At present certain international forces under the guise of ‘democracy’ and ‘human rights’ are interfering in the internal affairs of China and Russia, and brutally trampling on international law and recognised norms of international relations,” China’s state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Mr Xi as saying.“China and Russia should increase their joint efforts to more effectively safeguard the security interests of both parties.”In Moscow, Dr Donfried “discussed US concerns regarding Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine and reinforced the United States’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, according to the US embassy in the Russian capital.In Kiev on Tuesday she rejected as “pure disinformation” claims that Washington was pressing Ukraine to make concessions to Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and launched a proxy war in eastern Ukraine that has killed 14,000 people.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Russia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"can save victorian beauty traditional high streets","story":"Let us walk down a local high street in the noisy hubbub of a Victorian summer just over a century ago. Costermongers hawk their wares children stare at huge lollipops in the grocer’s window alongside piles of potted jams and pickles gaily striped awnings protect the butcher’s meats from the sun the sweet smell of bread escapes from the baker’s open door the inn advertises, in large gold-leafed letters, that “Ales, Stout \u0026amp Porter” are for sale. Market stalls, horse dung, water troughs, gently curving Georgian bay windows thick with a century’s encrusted paint. All life is here.A nostalgic memory? Undoubtedly. But for many a painful one. In too many high streets the current reality is one of no homes, fewer shops and scarce businesses. Many lovely Victorian and early 20th century shops are in desperate peril.The Victorian Society’s top 10 endangered buildings list includes a Peckham department store and a Stoke-on-Trent indoor market. Just last month, Westminster council shamefully gave M\u0026ampS permission to demolish its beautiful 1930 Oxford Street branch to replace it with a tedious and unvarying grid of identical windows. We can call this “spreadsheet architecture”.These buildings are universally lamented as soon as they are lost, but somehow it carries on happening. Nobody argues that our towns are improved by their loss. Nobody argues that it is more environmentally friendly to replace them rather than refurbish them. And yet these buildings continue to go.We can, however, go some way towards correcting this horrific trend. The aftermath of the pandemic, which has exacerbated the crumbling of traditional high street infrastructure, has given us an opportunity.Vanishingly few early 20th century traditional buildings are listed by Historic England, trapped by a definition of “architectural significance” that regards architectural history as a fast train to modernism. No specialised body exists whose heart is in the fight for these lovely buildings with their rich stylistic range: Bankers’ Georgian, Deco, Classical, Néo-Grec, Renaissance, and so on. So let us empower those who have the capacity to take this task on.We should then adapt the VAT system, which is biased in favour of new builds versus renovation. This particularly matters in “left behind” towns where most incentives are to let high streets rot and restart elsewhere. The Government should make it VAT-free to bring derelict buildings back into use or charge a reduced rate of 5 per cent.Most importantly, we should let high streets come back to complex life again as agreeable places where people live and work as well as shop.Internet shopping is here to stay, but thanks to welcome innovations over the past decade, mechanisms exist which councils could use to make it easier for owners to invest in converting buildings for other uses. None are fully taking the opportunity, nervous of ceding control.A flourishing high street is an attractive place where people wish to live, to meet, to converse, to buy, to sell and to be amused. We cannot go back to the 1890s but there’s nothing to stop future high streets being even better.

Ten days is the time period people have to self-isolate if they test positive.Meanwhile, hospitality chiefs have warned that they are seeing cancellations en masse as people begin imposing ‘restrictions by stealth’ on themselves to protect their hopes of a family Christmas.Figures from the satnav and transport analytics company, TomTom, showed that rush-hour traffic peaked at 59 per cent of normal levels on Wednesday, compared to 68 per cent on Tuesday morning.The drop marks a further fall-off in the already sharp decline seen in travel since the Government’s work-from-home guidance came into effect on Monday.Data from the Department for Transport showed that on Monday, London Tube usage slumped to 50 per cent, down from 56 per cent on the previous Monday. Meanwhile, rail usage in the country fell back to its lowest levels since August.The capital’s economy has been particularly hit as Covid levels have surged in London in recent weeks following the rise of the more transmissible omicron variant.Covid rates are now at their highest in London since January, with infections rising from 347 to 537 cases per 100,000 people in the last fortnight.The hospitality industry today warned it was seeing mass cancellations since the rise of omicron despite Boris Johnson urging people not to cancel their Christmas parties. The industry body UKHospitality said restaurants and hotels were reporting that around 40 per cent of Christmas bookings had been cancelled over the last two weeks, rising to 60 per cent in central London. The chef Tom Kerridge recently tweeted a long list of cancellations, as shown below.Kate Nicholls OBE, the CEO of UKHospitality, told The : “Undoubtedly there is a great desire for people to protect a family Christmas and therefore they are adjusting their behaviour accordingly in advance. Consumer confidence is the key.“You are seeing restrictions by stealth almost. Whether it is deliberate or accidental, there is a nudge and people are changing their behaviour as a result.”Christmas is a key time for hospitality businesses, with many banking on making around 25 per cent of their revenue in the weeks leading up to New Year.Ms Nicholls said she had already heard from small businesses saying they were folding due to the latest hit to their trade, while others are mothballing their services until January.She called for the Government to bring in renewed financial support for the sector, warning hospitality businesses were already “battered and bruised” by Covid and thousands of jobs were again at risk.More from NewsCovid latest news: Boris Johnson holds press conference as UK reports highest daily cases after 32pc rise - watch liveNew German chancellor encourages more immigrationQueen ‘will wait until last moment before deciding whether to do annual Christmas lunch’Kremlin ordered brazen killing in Berlin park, German court findsPressure mounts ahead of North Shropshire by-election as Christmas party photo used against ToriesAsking older workers ‘when do you plan to retire?’ is age discrimination, rules tribunalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public mood turning sherelle jacobs responds readers omicron","story":"In my column this week, I argued that the UK is on a conveyor belt towards another lockdown, but that too little attention is paid to the uncertain costs of the restrictions. It may even be that the effects of lockdowns are getting worse every time they are tried. Here, I respond to a selection of comments from  readers:Bill John wrote: “I have no idea whether these measures are necessary or not. Like most of the people below the line, as well as Sherelle Jacobs above the line, I have none of the skills, qualifications or experience necessary to make that judgment. Which is why it is best handed over to that tiny minority of people who do.”Mr John suggests that armchair critics like me should leave the field to the experts. But given the high stakes inherent in whatever decisions are made, this minority of scientific experts and politicians should, at the very minimum, be able to demonstrate two things. First, that their decisions are informed by clinical evidence, as well as modelling. Second, that they include a detailed cost-benefit analysis that balances the potential Covid risks to the NHS against the possible fallout of restrictions.As I wrote in my column, there is very little evidence of either. One thing that particularly alarms me is the bizarre failure to seize the opportunity, over recent months, to gather useful data and evidence for proper cost-benefit analyses when the situation demands. There has been little research into the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on society. On the other end of the scale, the NHS has not published in full critical care capacity since the start of the pandemic, claiming it lacks the resources to do so. It is therefore very difficult to assess the threat of the health service becoming overwhelmed. Until I am convinced that those who are supposed to know what they are talking about actually do know what they are talking about, I am afraid that I will continue my endeavours to hold them to account.  The core argument in my piece this week was that we cannot go on with the same narrow and histrionic approach to the pandemic. The big question now is whether the wider public, which has largely supported the Government’s Covid measures, is starting to fall in with this view. Jane Marks-Chell argues that “the mood is changing in the UK”. This sentiment is echoed by Alex Thomson who says that “the public are exhausted of measures but (just about) still complying, albeit with a barely disguised cynicism, and for many, compliance is now performative”. readers are on the money here the polls are indeed starting to shift. Sixty eight per cent of English adults are opposed to closing pubs and restaurants, and 61 per cent are against any ban on household mixing, according to a YouGov survey published in the first week of December. We need to see more recent data, but at the end of November just before the omicron panic set in, support for working from home was declining, with 56 per cent in favour, compared with 85 per cent in April 2020.Keith Turkish speaks for many  readers when he says: “If this is what is required to protect the NHS, then it is not fit for purpose. Throwing more money at the behemoth is not the right answer.” So does Nick Elliott, who points to the “decades of poor management” and the lack of “courage for reform”. I completely agree on all these points. Again, though, the key political question now is whether the wider public share this view. Tory politicians remain convinced that Workington Man tends more to the perspective that the NHS is simply underfunded. Yet even before the pandemic, a survey in 2018 found that 58 per cent of British voters believe that the NHS needs reform more than it needs extra cash. Polls also consistently show that voters believe the NHS wastes money. If a consensus gathers around the idea that learning to live with Covid requires root-and-branch NHS reform, then the Conservatives will come to seriously regret their timidity on this front. At the very least, alongside efforts to clear the current backlog, we need a radical national plan for boosting ICU capacity, with “silent” ICU wards that can be activated during an emergency and expanding the pool of non-ICU staff that can assist during surges. If not, come election time, voters will be asking where all the extra money has gone. And this populist Tory Government may find itself more unpopular than it has ever been. More from NewsCovid latest news: Boris Johnson holds press conference as UK reports highest daily cases after 32pc rise - watch liveNew German chancellor encourages more immigrationQueen ‘will wait until last moment before deciding whether to do annual Christmas lunch’Kremlin ordered brazen killing in Berlin park, German court findsPressure mounts ahead of North Shropshire by-election as Christmas party photo used against ToriesAsking older workers ‘when do you plan to retire?’ is age discrimination, rules tribunalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed success every single school getting pupils oxford cambridge","story":"Choosing which school to send your children to is one of the most important decisions a parent will make.Some families will prioritise looking at which extra-curricular activities a school offers, while others will be more concerned about the amount of outdoor space.But for many parents, the most important consideration is the academic credentials of the school and whether it has a good track record of sending pupils to the country’s two top universities: Oxford and Cambridge.The  has obtained data from Oxford and Cambridge about how many offers they have made to every single school over the past five years.You can now see how many Oxbridge offers pupils at every school in the UK - as well as international schools - have received each year between 2017 and 2021.You can also examine the success rate of every school, which is calculated by working out how many of their pupils’ applications resulted in offers each year.Use our interactive graphic here to explore the results.

With immunity escape mutations far beyond anything immunologists had anticipated could arise so soon, omicron is surging through countries even when most of their populations had had previous variants or been heavily vaccinated.In the UK omicron infections are estimated to be doubling every 2.3 days (versus delta’s 5-6), and may be at 400,000 infections per day already. It’s not impossible that 25 per cent of the population have omicron at the same time, this Christmas Day.Speed is one thing severity is another. Though prior infection with an earlier variant or vaccination with only one or two doses don’t appear to provide much in the way of protection against infection, they do hold up fairly well in protecting those infected from getting serious disease – something like 70 per cent protection in the latest South African study. With boosters (or two doses and a prior infection) transmission protection and serious disease protection is much higher. Hence the Government’s booster campaign.There has been some suggestion omicron is intrinsically a milder disease. The latest South African data does not appear to support that (or at least not to any material degree). The much-discussed reduction in severity of disease there appears merely to be in line with what one would expect from prior immunity and vaccination.Although our vaccines should protect most of us from serious disease and the most vulnerable should be well-protected by their boosters, the sheer speed of omicron means even if it has a very low hospitalisation rate that could lead to a lot of hospitalisations occurring at once. As matters stand it appears plausible there could be over one million infections per day at peak. Even if the hospitalisation rate is only 0.5 per cent of infections (and it may be a bit higher than that, despite vaccines), that would mean over 5,000 hospitalisations per day – well in excess of the hospitalisations peak last January. That wouldn’t last long – just a week or so. But policymakers may become nervous that the NHS could be swamped and thousands of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may find it unavailable – with potentially disastrous consequences.Because of that, there is talk of additional restrictions, even as Plan B struggles through Parliament against the opposition of 100 Tory rebels. Plan B seems likely to be utterly ineffectual against omicron. As hospitalisations started to rise, might policymakers lose their nerve and seek to impose a lockdown?Surely a far better approach would be to strongly advise the vulnerable (defined as we defined them last year, for shielding purposes) to shield for the next three weeks. We would make special deliveries and could create a special public holiday on January 6th this year, where we go and have Christmas (or Epiphany) dinner with them, swap gifts like the Wise Men and sing Epiphany carols. It wouldn’t be mandatory – those who want to take their chances could do so. There would be no “cancelling Christmas”. Younger people would mingle normally. It’s just that we’d do the bit of our Christmas where we spent time with the vulnerable on January 6th instead of Christmas Day or Boxing Day.Folk ask: “Could it make that much difference?” Yes. If omicron is spreading as rapidly as is thought, then daily infections on January 6th might be only one quarter or less of their level on Christmas Day. The aim is not to try to stop the vulnerable ever being exposed to omicron. It is merely to try to cut the number of them that get infected at the absolute peak, so that not so many are seeking hospital attention at the same time. Conversely, if omicron isn’t going to spread so rapidly, then there’s no problem and no reason for any restrictions at all, because the peak load on the NHS won’t be all that high.If omicron isn’t going to be a problem, we’ll probably know within about a week from now, from the South African data. In that case we could advise the vulnerable they can deshield – in time for Christmas.Decisions on shielding need to be made immediately. We cannot wait until after Christmas, or even another week from now. Omicron is here and may already be infecting 400,000 new people per day. We should not need additional restrictions and talk of a lockdown in the New Year is pointless. Just advising the vulnerable to shield for a few brief weeks, starting immediately, and having one special public holiday on January 6th should be enough.More from NewsCovid latest news: Boris Johnson holds press conference as UK reports highest daily cases after 32pc rise - watch liveNew German chancellor encourages more immigrationQueen ‘will wait until last moment before deciding whether to do annual Christmas lunch’Kremlin ordered brazen killing in Berlin park, German court findsPressure mounts ahead of North Shropshire by-election as Christmas party photo used against ToriesAsking older workers ‘when do you plan to retire?’ is age discrimination, rules tribunalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"used love lifelong tories abandon boris ahead north shropshire","story":"In Boris Johnson’s two years as prime minister never has an election mattered more than the North Shropshire by-election.The Conservatives hold a 22,000 majority in the seat, which they have held for the best part of 200 years. However, after months of crises ranging from the original sleaze story which caused the by-election to stories of Number 10 staff hosting Christmas parties whilst the country was in lockdown, the Tories face a real challenge to hold onto the seat.To find out what voters in North Shropshire really care about Christopher Hope travelled to the constituency ahead of the by-election on Thursday. Watch the full film above. More from NewsCovid latest news: Boris Johnson holds press conference as UK reports highest daily cases after 32pc rise - watch liveNew German chancellor encourages more immigrationQueen ‘will wait until last moment before deciding whether to do annual Christmas lunch’Kremlin ordered brazen killing in Berlin park, German court findsPressure mounts ahead of North Shropshire by-election as Christmas party photo used against ToriesAsking older workers ‘when do you plan to retire?’ is age discrimination, rules tribunalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"weeks best christmas party parliaments no lobby","story":"Presumably reunions, like Christmas drinks and karaoke nights, are now frowned upon at Westminster. Even less popular, one would have thought, are friendly cross-party reunions of MPs. But that didn’t stop the organisers of Tuesday\u0027s rebellion against Covid passes from organising an extraordinary gathering. And by all accounts, a smashing time was had by all.The venue was the No lobby of the House of Commons. Drinks, as far as we know, were not served (but who knows what photographic evidence to the contrary may emerge in the near future). The occasion in question was a get-together of old friends, on the far-Left of Labour and the mainstream of the Conservative party, to rebel against Covid passports. In previous decades, these same people have found common cause in opposing the New Labour governments. Their numbers included Labour MPs — and also Jeremy Corbyn — who would regularly, frequently and happily walk through the ision lobby in protest at whatever the then government was trying to do. To the likes of Corbyn and his comrades in the Campaign Group of Labour MPs (Corbyn was considered a Labour MP at the time that’s how long ago this was), the pink slip sent out by the government whips’ office each week was no more than a handy device for jotting down that week’s grievance, and maybe a few inspirational quotes from Che Guevara.Week after week, those Labour MPs would join with the official opposition and vote against Tony Blair, the leader who had got them elected to parliament in the first place. Their cause was greater than mere party allegiance, they told themselves. Socialism, not a Labour government, was the goal. They were joined in this endeavour, of course, by the likes of David Cameron, Iain Duncan Smith and John Redwood.Naturally, time spent in the trenches with other combatants tends to encourage friendly relations. It was a bit like the Christmas Day truce on the Western Front in 1914, except when fighting resumed, the Campaign group didn’t return to their own trenches, at least not until after the war ended and Labour returned to their natural position on the opposition benches, which is where Corbyn and co. always felt more comfortable anyway.Not all of the eight Labour MPs (plus Corbyn) who voted against the Labour whip last night were veterans of the old wars. Most of them have never known what it’s like to be in government, and we must presume they’re grateful for that. Had the likes of Clive Lewis and Rebecca Long-Bailey been MPs in that period, we may be certain they would have joined Diane Abbott and John McDonnell in their repeated journeys through the lobbies in defiance of the then Labour government. One can only imagine these young whippersnappers sitting at McDonnell\u0027s feet asking him to regale them with exciting stories about how he refused to capitulate to the Northern Ireland peace process.We do not know what friendly hugs and handshakes were exchanged in the No lobby last night, what reminiscences were shared of the good old days when far-Left and centre-Right made common cause. Did the Labour and Conservative rebels even have a similar agenda last night? Not exactly. What irked Corbyn and his colleagues who still have the Labour whip was not so much the introduction of Covid passports for various venues (although they seem to be no fans of that particular initiative) as the threat of forcing all NHS staff to be vaccinated against Covid.On the face of it, this objection, especially for Labour MPs, is an odd one. And if you scratch the surface and dig down a few more feet, it remains just as odd. Why would people who claim to love the NHS more than their closest relatives cavil at the prospect of protecting vulnerable patients from the self-indulgence of nurses who watch too many YouTube videos about the link between AstraZeneca and 5G masts?Are any of those Labour MPs who voted against compulsory vaccination for Covid on the record for having opposed the existing rule that some NHS staff, particularly those involved in surgery, are already obliged to get vaccinated against hepatitis B? Or do Corbyn and co. believe there should be one rule for the highest paid people (consultants) and another one for cleaners?But such inconsistencies are small beer compared to the rather more notable practice of voting alongside those you claim are your fiercest opponents. That experience is, presumably, less traumatic for Labour MPs today than it should have been during the years of a Labour government. After all, last night, they were all voting against the policy of a Conservative government, something the Campaign Group are only slightly less enthusiastic about than voting against a Labour one.It must have been more worrying for the mass of Conservative MPs to find themselves in a small room with the fringe of the Labour Party. Didn’t that make some of the more sensible ones think twice about who they were keeping company with?Still, it’s all part of the game. It will give a future generation of MPs, from both sides, something to discuss with the veterans of cross-party co-operation the next time any government of whatever colour does something to justify another get-together in the No lobby.And the best thing, from the Labour rebels’ point of view, about last night? They lost! Another glorious defeat for the self-righteous battalions. Another badge of pride. All that was missing, the only thing that would have made the night a perfect one, enough comrades to start a sing-song, and for someone to throw the Royal Mace around a bit.

But we live in an era where there is so much information being stored that it will eventually come out. “We have heard from many top virologists that a genetically engineered origin is reasonable and that includes virologists who made modifications to the first Sars virus. “We know this virus has a unique feature, called the furin cleavage site, and without this feature there is no way this would be causing this pandemic.“A proposal was leaked showing that EcoHealth and the Wuhan Institute of Virology were developing a pipeline for inserting novel furin cleavage sites. So, you find these scientists who said in early 2018 ‘I’m going to put horns on horses’ and at the end of 2019 a unicorn turns up in Wuhan city.” Viscount Ridley, who co-authored a book on the origin of the virus with Dr Chan, said he also believed a lab leak was now the likely origin.Lord Ridley told MPs: “I also think it’s more likely than not because we have to face the fact after two months we knew the origins of Sars, and after a couple of months we knew Mers was though through camels, but after two years we still haven\u0027t found a single infected animal that could be the progenitor, and that’s incredibly surprising.“We need to find out so we can prevent the next pandemic. We need to know whether we should be tightening up work in laboratories or whether we should be tightening up regulations related to wildlife markets. At the moment we are really not doing either. “We also need to know to deter bad actors who are watching this episode and thinking that unleashing a pandemic is something they could get away with. “We know now that experiments were being done at biosecurity level 2 (similar to a dentist\u0027s office) that resulted in 10,000 times increases in infectivity of viruses and three or four times their lethality. The important thing is to stop doing these experiments that are risky.”During the session, the editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, was also criticised over a letter published by the journal in 2020 which dismissed the lab leak theory as a ‘conspiracy theory’ and effectively shut down the debate into the lab leak theory.The letter was authored by Peter Daszak, the head of EcoHealth alliance, who had worked closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) engineering bat coronaviruses. Yet despite the close link, it took 16 months for the Lancet to publish a memo setting out Mr Daszak’s conflicts of interest. Aaron Bell said the memorandum declaring Mr Daszak’s interests had been ‘too little too late.’Mr Horton argued it had taken more than a year to ‘persuade’ Mr Daszak to declare that EcoHealth was working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “We ask everybody to declare their competing interest and we take those statements on trust and in this care regrettably the authors claimed they had no competing interest and of course the implication there were indeed competing interests that were significant, particularly in relation to Peter Daszak,” said Mr Horton.“We take declarations of conflicts of interests on trust. We quickly became aware of Peter Daszak’s conflict of interest and we ended up having a debate with him because his view was ‘Look, I’m an expert working in China on bat coronaviruses and that isn’t a competing interest, it makes me an expert.’“But in the court of public opinion, that is a competing interest you should declare and it took us over a year to persuade him to declare his full competing interest.”Mr Horton also said that the lab leak was now: ‘a hypothesis that should be taken seriously and needs to be further investigated.’More from NewsNew German chancellor encourages more immigrationCovid latest news: Boris Johnson holds press conference as UK reports highest daily cases after 32pc rise - watch liveQueen ‘will wait until last moment before deciding whether to do annual Christmas lunch’Kremlin ordered brazen killing in Berlin park, German court findsPressure mounts ahead of North Shropshire by-election as Christmas party photo used against ToriesAsking older workers ‘when do you plan to retire?’ is age discrimination, rules tribunalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"you ready new brexit rules","story":"Are you ready for the next phase of Brexit rules from Jan ,   Heres what you need to knowNew rules are coming for businesses, and you need to act nowAdvertorialByLaura Tait:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsThe UK has left the EU, which could mean changes for your business. As we build a new relationship with our European partners, there are planned phased changes to the import of goods, including customs declarations and border checks. If your business imports or exports goods to or from the EU, it’s essential you understand how the new system works to ensure you keep your business moving. What’s changed  You may need to pre-noty imports to Great Britain of some food, animal products, plants and plant products from the EU.If your business imports food, animal products, plants or plant products from the EU then you may need to pre-noty these imports. This means you must let the authorities know that your consignment is entering Great Britain. Simply register for the relevant IT system - for animal or plant products - now to ensure you are prepared for the pre-notication requirements from January .What goods are included The new requirements cover the import of some Sanitary and Phytosanitary goods, such as meat or plants, coming into Great Britain from the EU. Most Products of Animal Origin, Animal By-Products, High Risk Food and Feed not of Animal Origin and regulated plants and plant products will require pre-notication when brought into Great Britain from the EU. There’s guidance online at gov.uk for food, animal by-products and plants.You may need to pre-noty the authoritiesyou want to import plants for your business.  What  do I need to do  You will need to tell authorities where your goods have come from.Rules of Origin are another key element of the new trading requirements - the UKaposs deal with the EU is called the Trade and Cooperation Agreementand it determines the country of origin of goods traded between them. You must be able to prove the goods you are importing or exporting meet the rules of origin to use preferential tarfs. This means you’ll need to prove where the goods have been grown, produced or manufactured – and remember this is not necessarily the same country as the one you bought them from. Find out more about rules of origin on gov.uk here.What about customs declarations  The new rules starting on January  also mean that businesses moving goods into Great Britain from the EU must submit customs declarations. This must be done at the time your courier or freight forwarder brings the goods into Great Britain.There’s further guidance at gov.uk that provides you with details, including how much tax and duty you’ll need to pay and whether you need a license or certicate.You can also apply for authorisation to use simplied declarations for imports. This means you can move goods into a customs procedure without having to provide a full customs declaration. But be warned, it takes up to  days to complete the necessary checks, so plan ahead to ensure you have it in place before you want to start moving goods next year. Can I use a customs agent Some businesses find it easier to use a customs agent, a courier of a freight forwarder to complete import and export declarations on their behalf. There’s detailed information on how this works at gov.uk guidance appoint-someone-to-deal-with-customs-on-your-behalf. Disclaimer: Rules may be dferent for Northern Ireland.

Evenbooster jabs are found to be effective against Omicron, they projected a wave of infection which could lead to a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions.MPs are due to vote on Plan B restrictions in the Commons later, with Boris Johnson facing a major Tory revolt over plans for Covid passports for nightclubs and large events. It comes after Mr Johnson warned his Cabinet “a huge spike of Omicron was coming” and said a model claiming , people got infected with the iant yesterday was “valid”. Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty also reportedly told the Cabinet that pubs, shops and restaurants could be forced to shut in January due to staff shortages caused by Omicron. Dr Hopkins was grilled about the need for restrictions by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Asked by Tory Committee chair Greg Clark on the exit strategy from Covid curbs, she said: This is our fourth time going into something like this.The waves last a period of time and the more the restrictions are effective, then the smaller the peak, and therefore you can reduce andle to normal. She said boosting the population was likely to reduce hospitalisations - and limit the strain on the NHS.Asked when restrictions could be lted based on the modelling so far, she said: So I think thatthe modelling that the London School has done [is right], I would expect that there is going to be needing some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeks.” It came as Downing Street today refused again to rule out bringing in new restrictions before Christmas. Whitehall officials have reportedly been drawing up tighter curbs for England - that could include limiting pubs and restaurants to outdoor dining. They could even be forced to shut their doors entirelyit means people can see their families at Christmas. The PM’s spokesman insisted Plan B measures - which stop short of restrictions on pubs - “were balanced and proportionate”. But he refused to rule out further restrictions, calling them speculation and hypothetical”, and saying only that there weren’t “plans” to bring them in.  Asked about reports furlough could be brought backpubs have to shut, he replied: “I’m not going to get into hypotheticals - no plans.” And he refused to rule out bringing in restrictions while MPs are on their Christmas break. The spokesman said: “What we are saying is we want to introduce the measures as set out in Plan B, which will help reduce transmission whilst we get more boosters in arms, which is the biggest single action we can take. “As I’ve said on a number of occasions, we need to learn more about this iant on things like severity before we decide what,any, action is required in the future.” He added: “Obviously we will always want to ensure Parliament will have its say, should there be any requirements to make changes. “In extremis, as the public would expect, we have the ability in the interests of public health to make changes.” Askedchanges could be made while MPs are on recess he replied: “It would depend on the circumstances.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It shows  people crowded together - in blatant breach of lockdown rules - in a medium-sized room in the party’s Westminster HQ.Some of the group are shown wearing paper hats while one is sporting a House of Commons Christmas jumper.The event, organised by top Tory Shaun Bailey ’s mayoral campaign, took place on December  last year when London was in Tier .After he was approached by the Mirror tonight, Mr Bailey dramatically quit as chair of the London Assembly’s police and crime committee.  The image also shows several guests - including billionaire Tory donor Nick Candy - raising glasses of wine while a catered buffet features prominently. One of the revellers was a senior figure on Boris Johnsonaposs leadership election campaign. It emerged last week that Tory staff danced and drank wine late into the night and revellers damaged a door at what was described as a “raucous” event. At the time, the capital was in Tier  restrictions which banned any social mixing between households indoors.The party took place the day before the No  festive quiz, where Boris Johnson was pictured as quizmaster, and four days ahead of the Downing Street Christmas bash.Hours before the party then health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the capital would move into tougher Tier  restrictions. Tory insiders suggested tonight that party chairman Oliver Dowden was appalled by the photograph of the festive event. The Conservatives have said that “formal disciplinary action” had been taken against four CCHQ staff seconded to the campaign. A spokesman said: “Senior CCHQ staff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of [CCHQ] organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of th December. “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign.” Scotland Yard has until now refused to investigate the Christmas gatherings citing a lack of evidence.  Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “This is damning new evidence of a party, with a buffet, drinks, Christmas attire and absolutely no social distancing held at Conservative Party HQ.“Shaun Bailey is an elected official that is clearly breaking Covid regulations in this photo and encouraging the same of his staff. “Whilst everyone  was making sacrices to keep their community safe, the chair of the Police and Crime committee in the Greater London Authority was partying. “His position as chair was untenable and he knew that.” Mr Bailey, who does not drink alcohol, is said to have left the party early in the evening, shortly after the picture was taken. A Shaun Bailey campaign spokesperson said: “On the evening of  December , at the end of the working day, the campaign hosted a post-work event to thank campaign staff for their efforts over the course of they year. “This was a serious error of judgement and we fully accept that gathering like this as that time was wrong and apologise unreservedly”.

The revolt raised serious questions about his authority, which has been battered by multiple claims of rule-breaking parties in Westminster in the run up to Christmas last year. In a fiery Prime Ministeraposs Questions clash, Mr Starmer said: The virus is spreading once again and lives and livelihoods are at risk. The British public are looking for a prime minister with the trust and the authority to lead Britain through the crisis.  Instead we are burdened with the worst possible Prime Minister at the worst possible time. He mocked jeering Tory MPs, many of whom rebelled against the Government yesterday, saying: Where were they in the lobby last night  Mr Starmer went on: His own MPs have had enough, they wonapost defend him and they wonapost turn up to support him andhe proposes them, they wonapost vote for basic public health measures. He said the PM was so weak that Plan B measures would not have got through without Labour backing. The PM declared itaposs not true, with Mr Starmer adding: Heaposs so socially distanced from the truth, he thinks thataposs not true. I donapost know where to start. We canapost go on with a Prime Minister who is too weak to lead. So will the Prime Minister take time this Christmas to look in the mirror and ask himself whether he has the trust and authority to lead this country  Mr Johnson replied: We won that vote last night with Conservative votes. I respect the anxieties have colleagues have - of course I do - about restrictions on their liberty. But I believe the approach we are taking is balanced, proportionate and right for this country. Mr Johnson defended the tough decisions he has taken and tried to accuse Labour of playing politics during a crisis. He concluded: They vacillate, we vaccinate. They jabber, we jab. They play party politics and we get on with the job. In bad-tempered scenes, SDLP MP Colum Eastwood called on the PM to resign to restore public confidence. He said: The Prime Ministeraposs actions over the last number of months has absolutely eroded public confidence at the worst possible time and a public health crisis. excusing rule breaking by its own MPs ignoring real breaking and his own posts. He canapost even lead Tory MPs to vote for his public health guidance. How does he expect to lead anybody   Surely no, it is time Mr. Speaker for him to do the right thing. The only thing left him to restore public confidence and resign. The PM replied: No, Iaposm going to get on with making sure that we get through this pandemic together as one UK and making sure that we protect trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the way that I know he would want it protected.

Education Minister Alex Burghart said extra funding has been put in place so schools can test their pupils before heading back into the classroom. But Tory MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, said he fears we are moving towards de facto school closures, despite the Ministers assurances. Downing Street warned parents not to take their children out of school before term ends, responding to suggestions some parents kept their kids at home to protect them from Omicron. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: “The best place for children – who have in many respects suffered the most through this pandemic – is in school, receiving vital face-to-face education.”  He added: “It’s important schools – and indeed parents – don’t take precautionary steps to deprive their children of education”. Responding to a barrage of claims that schools may close, Mr Burghart told the Commons Government remains committed to ensuring schools reopen in January as normal, amid fears the spread of Omicron will keep kids at home. And he insisted the classroom is the very best place for children and their development. Mr Halfon said: “It seems to me we are moving sadly towards de facto school closures”, as he urged the Government to create an “army” of volunteers and public awareness campaign for the education sector. “The four horsemen of the education apocalypse have been galloping towards our young people in the form of a widening attainment gap, an epidemic of mental health problems, a rise in safeguarding hazards and a loss of le chances, he added.  Mr Burghart outlined the measures that will be enacted in schools to keep Covid at bay. They include on site lateral flow testing onfor secondary school students, continued regular testing at home and a comprehensive contingency framework to manage potential outbreaks. Tory MP Lia Nici echoed Mr Halfonaposs calls for better messaging, so parents and students feel safe ing to the classrom. She told the Commons: We need to make sure that parents understand that itaposs more important for the children to be at home and then not to be afraid. Could he just make sure that that we get the message out now to parents to say school is safe and school is the best thing for your children  Former health minister Steve Brine highlighted union calls for a staggeredin January, adding: “What is the Government going to do legally to see that its will is enforced and that schools are back, as they should be, as they need to be in January ” Shadow schools minister Stephen Morgan accused the Government of “complacency” on pupils’ health and education, claiming ministers were “falling short” on the issues of vaccination and ventilation in schools. He said: “Time and time again this Government’s failure to plan ahead has left children bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Ministers must stop treating them as an afterthought and act now to avoid chaos next term.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Shaun BaileyNadhim ZahawiConservative PartyNew YearEducationSchoolsMental healthSecondary schoolChildcarePoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes on the day of the Covid Pass roll out, which will make it mandatory for members of the public to present a vaccine passport to enter some venues. And for the third day people were forced to stand in snaking queues outside vaccination centres while waiting for their third booster dose. Speaking of the shortages, UK Health Security Agency chief Dr Jenny Harries said the spike in test seeking has caused temporary pressure. Dr Jenny Harries said the NHS is experiencing unprecedented demand for PCR tests.She went on: We had already planned to increase capacity over the winter, because we predicted a dficult winter. We clearly couldnapost predict a iant like Omicron. We have some flexibility there. We currently have about , tests per day available. If you go back to when we had no tests, or very few, about , I think going back to autumn last year, this is a huge achievement. She added: Yesterday the public may have seen some pressure on some of those sites. Iaposm in Wales. Some of the test sites here will be at seven per cent or eight per cent capacity. In London, they were quite full. People can still order tests at home, and we have put in mobile testing units to try and boost those supplies so people can get tested. So we do have sufficient tests both for PCR and LFTs . But the very rapid rises is causing some temporary pressure.  On Monday, Brits rushed out in their thousands to get a booster jab in a bid to save Christmas as Omicron sparked fears of another locked down festive period.Since then, members of the public were spotted queuing for hours outside vaccine centres. But as people rushed to do the right thing in the battle against the mutation drive, the NHS booking website crashed.Those arriving at vaccination centres faced five-hour long queues and online lateral flow tests ran out. Last week Boris Johnson announced his Plan B to deal with the sharp increase in Omicron cases.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the Prime Minister said the doubling time of the new strain could be between two and three days - meaning its spread will be rapid. Under the stricter rules people must show a Covid vaccine passport to enter some venues in England. Butsomeone is unjabbed they can still enter as long as they produce a negative lateral flow test. Covid passports will be made mandatory for nightclubs and large events, and rules on face masks would be “further extended” from Friday, to “most public indoor venues” including theatres and cinemas. Covid testing could also see up to one million Brits spending Christmas Day in isolation this year.Official models suggest that four times as many people could be self-isolating on December  compared to last year.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSChristmasCoronavirusCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Iris Jones has never been shy of talking about her sex le with her husband Mohamed, who is  years younger than her. She has said in the past that her husband is her pharaoh and has shared graphic details of the coupleaposs sex le - admitting she loves shocking people. Having married in November, , they were separated for almost a year as the Home Office sought proof of their relationship and his finances before giving him a spousal visa. Now with Mohamed having finally moved into her Weston-Super-Mare bungalow last month, the couple are keen to make up for lost time.Iris even told Closer magazine about their saucy plans for Christmas.On Christmas Day, Mohamed and I will just stay in bed, she said. Iris said they had no plans for giving presents as they “already have everything they want” but they may stop to listen to the Queen. She added: Weaposll have cheese on toast followed by mince pies and whipped cream, which Iaposll eat off his body - Iaposve never done that before.Weaposll take a break to watch The Queenaposs speech but other than that, youaposll find us between the sheets. Iris met Mohamed thanks to her son Stephen signing her up to Facebook and she joined a group for atheists where the Egyptian was also a member.Iris said she was impressed from the start with his good looks and intelligence. While she never imagined at the start that any romance would happen, Iris said how they started falling in love and then in November, , five months after connecting online, she flew to Cairo to meet him. Confident that it would all work out, she even packed her wedding dress. On that trip though they weren’t able to get married as his orce papers hadn’t come through and so they had to wait until her third trip to tie the knot in October .

One-year-old Rupert gets so excited to be on a walk, he bounces instead of walks when outside on his lead. The hilarious antics have gained over . million views, with TikTok users asking for more Rupert content.His owner, Molly Lethbridge, from Exeter in Devon, says from the moment his lead goes on to the moment he’s allowed to run free, the pup will jump for joy, making him look like anything but a dog. From behind, he looks more like a rabbit leaping on a lead.  The leaping dog doesn’t do one or two leaps, but he replaces his ‘four paw walk’ with powerful consecutive springs into the air. And it has finally caught people’s attention. Molly, , said: “He has lots of quirks that I’ve never known any other dog to have and this is one of many. I think he’s mistaken about what animal he is. “I’ve only just cottoned on to the fact other people notice and find it funny.” Rupert has been bunny hopping ever since his first walk, so for Molly and her fiancé Joe Wilson, also , it became the norm for their daily walks. They didn’t quite realise how unusual it was until people started to notice.Molly caught the behaviour on video and uploaded it ontoTikToklabelled ‘someone’s got the Christmas spirit.’The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family.

One user of the  said, “When you order a kangaroo off Wish,” while someone  said, “The floor is lava.” Another joked, “I’ll have what he’s having,” while someone said, “Past le grasshopper.” He was also compared to a kangaroo, Prancer and Dasher the reindeer, Bambi and Mario. Others claimed that it was so good it was ‘the best thing they have ever seen’ and made their day much brighter.  The comments were flooded with compliments on how funny it was, with Joe giving people an extra laugh. He is seen walking Rupert in the video while shaking his head asto say ‘not this again’. Their favourite place to walk is Budleigh Salterton, but it’s during any walk that Rupert jumps for joy. Molly said: “Rupert is everything we wanted in a dog and more. He makes us smile so much and it’s lovely to see him make other people smile.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Due to a store policy, Christine and another woman were told an announcement was not able to be made so they ed to the dog outside and discovered three more people had come to the dogaposs rescue. Two schoolgirls were among those trying to help and had moved the dog out of the rain and got her under shelter. Christine, , said: “The two young girls were great the entire time. “They were both just offering to do all kinds. aposCan we do this  Can we do that apos, they were brilliant. They stayed with the dog the whole time and just offered to do everything they could. “The youth of today get such a bad rap but they’re not all bad at all. Christine said she and another woman, who took the dog home, had contacted Birkenhead Kennels. After the incident Christine took to Facebook to thank the girls who stayed to help and offer them a voucher for their help. She wrote: Can I just day the two school girls from Woodchurch High were brilliant in helping with this situation andthey pop to Pigmentum in Moreton there is a voucher waiting for them there from me as a thank you for their help.” The post has been shared over  times and people flocked to praise the girls and the women involved. One woman wrote: “Well done to everyone involved for caring, I truly hope the situation is resolved for the dog ASAP. A second woman said: “Aaah God love her. She must have been terried! Hours on her own waiting for her owner to . Thank you to the lady who took her in and to the girls who helped. There are are some very kind and compassionate people around. While a third commented: “Hopefully a happy ending here. Well done Woodchurch girls. Hopefully it was undercover, Itaposs been raining all day I dread to think. A further two people commented to say they had also seen the dog outside the supermarket around pm but assumed the owner must have been inside the store. Christine said the circumstances of the dog are still unknown and despite putting the information on Facebook, nobody has claimed the abandoned dog. The Moreton shop owner said: “All I can only say about the dog is it did look really healthy and in good shape. It was really friendly and obedient as one of the girls told it to sit while I took a photo of it to post and it listened straight away. “Her collar looked nice, her lead looked nice so we can’t jump to any conclusions on what has happened - there could be lots of reasons behind it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AsdaCustomer serviceTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Experts believe the unpublished artwork, titled aposThe Virgin and Child with a Flower on a Grassy Bankapos, was produced by German Old Master Albrecht Durer in . The .ins by .ins pen and black ink drawing on fine linen paper, which is signed with the initials AD, is now being sold by London art gallery Agnews after extensive research confirmed its provenance. It came to light in  when a man aged in his s spotted it and bought it for the modest sum at an estate sale in Massachusetts, US. The American buyer was struck by the unframed drawingaposs beauty but both he and the seller believed it was a th century reproduction.  Clford Schorer, an art dealer for Agnews and a Durer expert, was informed about it from an antiquarian book dealer three years ago after the new owner had tried without success to sell it. He agreed to take a look at it himself and visited the vendor who presented the drawing to him on his dining room table. Mr Schorer stared at it for an hour as he was blown away by its aposmagnicenceapos, instantly thinking it could be the aposreal thingapos. From there, he set about authenticating the drawing, showing it to museums and experts including Dr Christop Metzger, chief curator at the Albertina museum in Vienna. Crucially, world renowned paper restorer Jane McAusland, who also inspected the drawing, identied Dureraposs aposTrident and Ringapos watermark. Mr Schorer said: I thought it was too beautul to be  and have spent three years seeking to authenticate it. I have shown the drawing to almost all the international Durer specialists to build a consensus . I believe this drawing is rarer than Raphaelaposs , and could fetch a record price. It is an extremely important addition to Dureraposs work, who is one of the Renaissanceaposs biggest names, and it is a once in a letime find.

Dr Jeff Foster explains how to stay safe, while also keeping your family safe this ChristmasIf youre planning on heading home to see family or loved ones for Christmas, you should be taking some Covid safety precautions Image: Getty ImagesBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | comments Itaposs been a tough year and, while there have been new restrictions introduced due to Omicron, families and loved ones are still able to reunite for Christmas . There are now reportedly  people in hospital with the Omicron Covid iant, and it may already be infecting an estimated , people daily in the UK, according to modelling for the government. While reuniting with family and friends is a welcome relief towards the end of the year, itaposs crucial to be careful when youaposre out and about and take precautions to reduce your chances of becoming infected with coronavirus. And,youaposre wondering how to keep your family as safe as possible at Christmas, we spoke to Dr Jeff Foster, Medical Director  Male Health Lead at hhealth, to find out some top tips. When should I isolate from so I can safely see my family at Christmas  While there is no official date outlined for keeping your family safe at Christmas, it is important to take precautions prior to visiting family for Christmas. Dr Jeff Foster tells : It certainly appears Omicron is more infective than previous iants and may also spread earlier. We know that the time from exposure to symptom onset, also known as the incubation period, is two to  days. However, he also explains that you can be asymptomatic for several days prior to feeling unwell and testing positive. Therefore, you should ideally isolate from around December ,  , up to six days prior, before seeing family or friends on Christmas Day. This will allow you to see whether you have any symptoms, and it also gives you plenty of time to get a PCR test result should you come into contact with someone whoaposs tested positive for Covid or the Omicron iant. And, there is also a risk of unintentionally infecting people you come into close contact with as you may not be aware of your symptoms instantly. Dr Foster says: You are not likely to be infectious for the first  hours of exposure as you wonapost have built up enough virus to be able to spread it to someone .Read More If you want to reduce your chances of spreading the virus, you should be regularly testing with lateral flow tests, particularlyyou feel any Omicron symptoms. The unusual Omicron symptoms to look out for ahead of visiting family this ChristmasWhile Covid symptoms for the iants have fairly similar characteristics, South African Medical Association chair Dr Angelique Coetzee, revealed that a key dferentiating symptom with Omicron is headaches on Tuesday, December .She said: Evenyou wake up with a slight headache, not feeling well, please come and let us [GPs] double check. Another potential Omicron symptom mentioned by Dr Coetzee was myalgia, so you may feel muscle soreness or body ache. If you begin to feel unwell and have any cold or flu-like symptoms, or even a headache, be sure to take a rapid lateral flow test as soon as possible and avoid socialising. Due to the incubation period, youaposre unlikely to test positive on a PCR test instantly, so Dr Coetzee recommends waiting  hours before testing.  Dr Jeff Fosteraposs tips for staying safe at Christmas and avoiding the spread of coronavirus If youaposre planning on heading home to visit family and loved ones this Christmas, Dr Jeff Foster recommends following these measures to keep yourself and others safe. . Get vaccinated Dr Foster says: This is the best thing you can do. One year on, we can see the massive benefits the vaccine has had in reducing hospitalisation and death. We also know that while there is some reduction in its effectiveness over time, the booster still has signicant protective effects even on the Omicron iant. The government aims to have offered all of the UKaposs adult population vaccinated with the booster jab by the end of .All adults in the country are now able to go to walk-in centres for their booster jab, or will soon be contacted to book an appointment.. Wear a mask As self-explanatory as it sounds, wearing a mask is one of the best ways to signicantly reduce your chances of getting Covid. Dr Foster explains: There are people that believe is an imposition on their liberties and rights, but overall the evidence is that it reduces the spread of the disease.  It is not a terrible imposition to ask, it harms no one and it may help save an elderly or vulnerable personaposs le. . Ventilation is key While comfort and cosiness is key at Christmas, itaposs worth keeping windows open throughout the house whenever possible when youaposre with your family during the festive season. Revealing how much of a dference it makes, Dr Foster says: Covid likes stale and still air where it can be breathed in again and again. You will not get covid from breathing a single virus, but it is about breathing enough of it in to trigger an immune response and allow the virus to spread. Keep your windows open and circulate the air. This disperses the virus and reduces the chance of breathing it in.. Hand sanitiser Another factor thataposs absolutely crucial when out and about or on public transport is using hand sanitiser and washing your hands frequently. Keep a mini bottle in your pocket or bag and sanitise your hands throughout the day to avoid spreading the virus. Dr Foster adds: In addition to breathing it in, touching something a virus has had contact with and then touching our faces is a common way we get a lot of viruses including covid. Wash your hands and give people a ready supply of hand gel.

Willy Wardlaw, who lives with his we and two children in Stirling, Scotland, says the issue has been ongoing for “four to five years”. It repeats every time there is heavy rain in the area, he said, leaving his young family having to wade through waste on their way out of their home. He has been left angered by the efforts of Scottish Water to address the drainage problem, claiming he has been “fobbed off” with quick clean ups, rather than action to reverse the blocking issues.Willy told theDaily Recordthe issue had been going on for “years”.  “It’s about the fourth or fth time this year that it has been covered with sewage,” he said. “The main drain comes down the side of our street and backs up waste and toilet paper into our garden, meaning that my kids have to wade through it, as well as my elderly neighbour downstairs who can’t get out of her door. “We’ve been in touch with Scottish Water a few times about it, but they just send someone out to clean it up. “The guys who are sent out to clean it up do a great job, but they need to fix the source of the problem because the next time it rains, it’ll just happen again.  “We’ve written to them and contacted their Facebook page about it, but we don’t hear from anyone up the tree, just the guys who are sent out to clean it up.In response, a Scottish Water spokesperson said: “We are aware of an issue with sewer flooding at this property and have attended on a number of occasions to deal with blockages, clean the sewer and carry out clean-ups of the affected area. “Last week, Scottish Water operatives were in attendance and carried out investigations.

Discover Health conducted the research into the , cases and now have listed the symptom as myalgia - muscle aches and pains.Experts in the UK have already identied that Omicron tends to have very dferent symptoms from other iants of the disease.Normally people are asked to look out for a fever, persistent cough and loss of sense of taste or smell as signs of Covid.  But now Omicron is reported to give symptoms more like a common cold - a scratchy throat, runny nose, sneezing and headache. The symptoms are considered similar to a common cold - but experts have warned that in London,you think you have a cold, itaposs actually more likely to Omicron. The first UK cases of Omicron were only confirmed on November  and the speed of its spread has alarmed ministers and prompted a dramatic acceleration of the booster jab programme. Boris Johnson has set an ambitious target of one million jabs a day and to ensure the roll out is continuous, people will even be able to get their booster shot on Christmas Day. The UK Health Security Agency has previously projected that Omicron could become the dominant iant across the country by the middle of the month. So far one person is confirmed to have died from the Omicron iant - but their age or vaccination status isnapost known. NHS England have scrapped the -minute wait for patients after theyaposve have their Pfizer Covid jabbed to speed up the booster programme.  They have done away with the quarter-of-an-hour sit-down so more doses can be administered. The isolation rules have also changed, with those who have come into contact with a positive case expected to do a daily lateral flow test. But there are currently no PCR Covid test slots left in some areas of England. A top medic has warned that Covid restrictions could be needed for up to eight weeksmodelling on the impact of the Omicron iant is correct.Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency , said there would need to be some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeksestimates by the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicinewere accurate.Scientists at LSHTM said the new strain could cause between , to , deaths in England over the next five months after examining experimental data. Evenbooster jabs are found to be effective against Omicron, they projected a wave of infection which could lead to a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions.  Dr Hopkins was grilled about the need for restrictions by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Asked by Tory Committee chair Greg Clark on the exit strategy from Covid curbs, she said: This is our fourth time going into something like this. The waves last a period of time and the more the restrictions are effective, then the smaller the peak, and therefore you can reduce andle to normal.She said boosting the population was likely to reduce hospitalisations - and limit the strain on the NHS.Asked when restrictions could be lted based on the modelling so far, she said: So I think thatthe modelling that the London School has done [is right], I would expect that there is going to be needing some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeks.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Back painOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And another threat looms as official models predict cases of Omicron are doubling every two to three days - infecting , people daily, it has been reported. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandaposs chief medical officer, warned ministers at a Cabinet meeting yesterday that the mutation is spreading at an unbelievably fast rate. The rapid transmission will send four times as many Brits into isolation compared to Christmas , according to estimates. Regular cases of Covid are also at a high, with , new infections recorded yesterday. This represents the highest daily figure since January and an increase of  per cent compared to last week. Meanwhile, doctors have been identying patients suffering with Omicron. There have been a total of , infections recorded after a further  cases were logged yesterday.  Brits who test positive for Covid today may also be alone this Christmas. People are legally required to self-isolate for  days on receipt of a positive Covid test, eventhey donapost have symptoms. If symptoms are developed during those  days, the additional -day isolation would lead to Christmas being missed. The rules available online read: “If you are isolating because of a positive test result but did not have any symptoms, and you develop Covid- symptoms within your isolation period, start a new  day isolation period by counting  full days from the day following your symptom onset.” Leading virus experts fear Covid hospital admissions could reach , a day amid concerns about the Omicron spike. Infectious disease scientist, Graham Medley, told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Most of the infections at the moment are in young adults, so these are people who are far less likely to need hospital treatment in any case.But in the past, in previous waves, weaposve seen that move out into more older and more vulnerable generations and thereaposs no reason to suspect that wonapost happen during this wave. And then the numbers of people who end up in hospital is some combination of when people get infected, their vaccination status, as well as what Omicron is doing. I think it is a very real possibility thatthe numbers of infections increasing continues in the way that it has done and it spills out into older age groups than we could see the number of people being omitted to hospital getting very large and certainly going over the thousand, maybe up to , a day, the scientist, who works at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, added. Cabinet ministers have also been warned that the NHS could be overwhelmed in a matter of just four weeks. Ministers are said to have been told so many doctors and nurses could be off sick by January  that those left will struggle even more than now to care for patients.  Likewise ministers were told some pubs, shops and restaurants could have to shutstaff shortages leave them high and dry, according to reports. The Sun originally reported that ministers were warned some hospitals could have to turn patients away, but this was denied by Downing Street. The PM’s spokesman insisted there had not been any discussion or any warning about hospitals or clinical settings having to close as a result of this iant. He added: “We have strong measures in place and robust, and now tested, procedures in place to ensure [public services] can continue. Latest figures suggest  known Omicron patients are in hospital but numbers are expected to surge as more cases are detected.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he was unable to confirm any deaths from the new strain - but warned there is a lag between infections, hospitalisations and deaths.He said there country was facing a tidal wave of infections as the Government launched a mammoth booster programme to battle the Omicron emergency. Boris Johnson gave a televised address to the nation on Sunday night, where he said two doses of a vaccine is simply not enough to prevent the spread of Omicron - and the NHS could soon be overwhelmed.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON PoliticsMutant CoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCoronavirus lockdownCoronavirus testingChristmas DayChristmasCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But for royal children like Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, they donapost have to wait until the big day for some of their gts.And itaposs all down to a royal family tradition.They normally exchange and open their presents on Christmas Eve, a legacy of the German heritage of the monarchy.Former royal chef Darren McGrady said: The royals are of German descent so they weave in German traditions to their celebrations. After afternoon tea, they open gts on Christmas Eve, as is the German tradition.  So the Cambridge children will have already opened some of their presents before most other British kids.However, in , the Duchess of Cambridge did reveal George and Charlotte had been up early opening presents on Christmas Day itself.So maybe they open their presents that come from Santa on Christmas Day like other kids However, there is one type of present that Kate apparently like for her kids - and thataposs practical gts.

Royal author and expert Katie Nicholl told OK! : George enjoys his iPad at school, both he and Charlotte are quite tech-savvy and, like most children, there probably are technical gadgets and such like on their wish list.Iaposm sure theyaposre not going to want for anything, but when it comes to technology and screens, they are careful not to spoil them with extravagant gting.

Fuller sexually abused the nine-year-old girl in the hospital where he worked after she had died suddenly following complications from a common cold. The mum, who was not named, faced her daughteraposs attacker at Maidstone Crown Court on Wednesday where he is being sentenced for two murders and a string of sex attacks on corpses. Reading a victim impact statement, she said: I canapost say much of what I want to say to you today. What I can say is you raped my beautul daughter. She was the kindest person I have ever met. I donapost know how Iaposm going to carry on with my le now.  The mum said Fuller moved her daughteraposs toys and blankets to attack her, adding: I canapost even touch them now because of what he did. It breaks my heart.. I canapost eat, I canapost sleep, I feel sick. Her long blonde hair I brushed. But now I see that awful man touching her in that way. The court heard a string of statements from the families of Fulleraposs victims, who were aged between nine and . He attacked  women and girls of which  have been identied, the court heard today. One statement, read by prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC, was from the father of a woman who had died aged  from an eating disorder. The dad said: My we died  years ago when she was  and the last thing she said to me was to look after the children. From beyond the grave this monster has defiled my daughter who I had promised my dying we that I would look after. A statement from the sister of another victim who took her own le said: We all deserve respect and peace in death and knowing she was brutally violated at her most vulnerable is deeply distressing. Another victimaposs sister said: When she died we thought there was no more suffering or indignity. We thought she was at peace. How wrong we were. It is incomprehensible that there is someone in the world who would do something so horric. One son said: The news shocked me to the core. I now know that the thought of what this man did to my mother will never go away. When I think of my mother my mind immediately thinks of what he did to her.  Balding and bespectacled Fuller sat hunched in the dock wearing a grey prison tracksuit and a black face mask. The court heard how he filmed and photographed his morgue sex attacks and catalogued them in files hidden in his home titled Necro Lord, Deadliest and Best Yet. He also created a spreadsheet with the names and ages of his victims. Fuller had manipulated images of his victims to lighten or erase visible scars, the court heard.  He beat and strangled Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , to death before sexually assaulting them in two separate attacks in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in . Fuller was caught  years later after a DNA breakthrough and a search of his home revealed he had recorded himself abusing bodies in the mortuaries of hospitals over more than a decade. He pleaded guilty to murdering Wendy and Caroline days into his trial after previously admitting manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Fuller also pleaded guilty to  other offences, including  charges relating to  identied victims, including three children, in mortuaries between  and November . He filmed himself carrying out the attacks inside the now-closed Kent and Sussex Hospital and the Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Pembury, where he worked as an electrician since . Fuller was given a whole-le tarf which means he will never be released from prison.

After crushing the woman, the car smashes into a wall, bollards and a parked car. In the chaotic aftermath, two men dressed in black bail out of the car and run. A third casually walks away. A police car appears seconds later and officers give chase.The driver of the car was Ryan Deans, , who has now been locked up for four and a half years after the incident in Cheetham Hill.Deans was able to escape from the scene as police chased and caught his passenger Thomas Keogh after noticing he had a kne. After officers stopped Keogh, , he pretended to have a fit, Manchester Crown Court was told. Because of a suspected head injury Keogh was given priority, meaning the womanaposs treatment was delayed.  The court was told police became suspicious of the X-Trail at about .pm on April rd at the junction of Waterloo Road and Cheetham Hill Road, and decided to follow. The car was on  plates and had been stolen in a burglary in Longsight two days earlier. Deans panicked after realising he was being followed and a chase ensued. He jumped a red light and hit mph overtaking other cars during a two-minute chase. Deans mounted the pavement at the junction of Woodlands Street and Cheetham Hill Road, hitting the woman who was thrown several metres.  As police chased Keogh, Deans nonchalantly walked away. Deans, of Eccles, pleaded guilty to causing injury by dangerous driving, handling stolen goods, driving while disqualied, failing to stop and driving without insurance. Keogh, from Fallowfield, pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking and having a blade in a public, and was banned form driving and was jailed for  months. A third man, Ellis Barrett, of Tarporley Avenue, Manchester, was sentenced to a community order, curfew with a tag, and disqualied from driving after pleading guilty to theft without consent and being carried in a stolen motor vehicle.

Heres the key evidence that led to his le sentenceThere was a mountain of evidence against David Fuller, who pleaded guilty Image: PAByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec | comments Family photographs, DNA evidence and millions more depraved images led to murderer David Fuller receiving a le sentence. Fuller pleaded guilty to his crimes and was sentenced after admitting to the murders of Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , both from Tunbridge Wells in Kent. He will never be released from jail.He admitted to murdering the women days into his trial, and had previously admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility. The victims were found beaten and strangled, in , in horric incidents that became known as the aposBedsit Murdersapos. Ms Knellaposs body was found at her flat in the June of that year. However, Ms Pierce was found  miles away in Romney Marsh, her naked corpse found in a field after going missing in November, .His crimes stretched over three decades, and the court revealed a history of abuse of corpses in mortuaries in a tidal wave of grim evidence and the revelation of shocking events.The DNA evidence  The Bedsit Murders remained unsolved for over  years until DNA evidence led to Fuller. Cold-case detectives carried out a review of the national DNA database, which showed a close match to  people. This was eventually narrowed down to Fulleraposs brother, who partially matched samples taken from the crime scene in . Fuller, himself, was then revealed to be the killer, his DNA a billion-to-one match.  A prowler had been reported by victim Caroline Pierce one month before her disappearance. The prowler fitted the profile of Fuller. The prosecutor said: A male of a similar profile to Fuller had been seen looking through an address near to Wendy Knell on the same night. Fingerprints and family photos  The trial didnapost just rely on DNA evidence as, once Fuller was identied, he was swtly matched to other pieces found at the scene of the crimes. A bloodied Millets bag was found under victim Wendyaposs bed. It had a fingerprint on it that was a match to Fuller. Clarks footwear archivists also helped police to track down the bloody shoe marks found that belonged to a aposSportstrekapos trainer.  These shoes were then seen being worn in a family photo album by Fuller during the s and s. DS Ivan Beasley spoke about telling Wendy and Carolineaposs families of the arrest. He said: It was real, genuine shock. They had thought this day would never come. Clearly it has brought back a huge amount of emotion, trauma and grief. Depraved content on hard drives  An unexpected, but utterly horric, element of the case was the revelation of Fulleraposs other crimes. As well as the guilty murder plea, he also pleaded guilty to  other offences. This involves  charges relating to  identied victims, including three children, in mortuaries between  and November . They include the sexual penetration of a corpse, possessing an extreme pornographic image involving sexual interference with a corpse and the taking of indecent images of children.  Investigators have, so far, detected roughly  potential victims but conceded that all their identities may never come to light. Police raided his home in Heathfield, East Sussex, on December , , where they discovered hard drives with more than  million images of distressing sexual offences. These included images of him sexually assaulting dead bodies. Fuller had access to the bodies by working as a hospital electrician. He worked at the Kent and Sussex Hospital from , before moving on to Tunbridge Wells Hospital in . A jury at Maidstone Crown Court heard on Monday, December , , that Fuller had depraved sexual predilections and had attacked corpses for an extended period of time at the hospitals where he worked. You have proved that monsters exist  The ages of the bodies abused ranged wide, with one victim aged just nine-years-old. The childaposs mother said: It makes my skin crawl and it really does break my heart. I feel sick. I can’t sleep. It will haunt me forever. Ahead of sentencing, the daughter of a victim of the crimes was able to speak out.  She said: You have proved that monsters exist. You were cocky, arrogant and despicable. You are the worst of humanity. My mother was a survivor of domestic violence. It is almost too much to know that a man abused her again when she died, just because he could, for his own sexual gratication.

For over a decade and a half he has been a familiar face in the local community, having originally trained as a police dog but becoming a family pet when a working le was deemed unsuitable for him.Restaurant owners, shop and cafe workers came out for Barneyaposs goodbye, while his owner Anne did her best to hold back the tears, Belfast Live reports.  In the end, everyone wept for the big old dog who’d bounded into the le of the area and left to go home on stf legs, his belly full of treats, the end of his journey within sight. Anne said: “We’d held on as long as we could to Barney. We maybe should have let him go earlier but we just couldnapost and he didnapost want to go, we knew that. But one day he gave us the look and we knew it was time, he was tired, he was ready. His hips had become very stf and sore but worse than that he’d developed a tumour in his nose and mouth. So we knew the end was coming but it was hard to contemplate le without him, and it has been heartbreaking to say goodbye not only for us but for all the friends heaposd made along the way. “But as with everything, we did it for him, we did our best for Barney every day and saying goodbye was the kindest but hardest of them all. “All of his letime with us he’d had a daily routine of a walk through Ballyhackamore where he knew the staff in every cafe and shop. In that way he was really the community’s dog. He brought a smile to so many faces and his cafe friends told us his visit was the highlight of their day. For  years we did the rounds with him, his favourite stop off was at Cafe Nero where he always enjoyed a croissant and a cuddle.” Barney began police training aged nine months where he was trained to be an explosives detection dog. But while he showed talent for detecting explosives and bombs, Barney had no interest in staying with them until his handler arrived. So he was given up by the police as a lovely but unreliable police officer. Anne said: “Barney was our constant companion, everyone’s go-to ear for a chat, everyone’s hug, a comfort to us all. He was such a big softie, and after two changes of home, he made ours his last and he stayed with us for more than  years. “When it came to the day we knew we had to say goodbye, we knew we needed others to have that chance too. So we walked slowly to the coffee shops and everyone had a chat and a cuddle and a cry and everyone got to say their goodbyes to one of their best customers. He took his time and we let him. I honestly think he knew what was going on. It was emotional and dficult but also a great comfort to us and to his friends. “We went home again for a rest and then we went out to Seapark in Holywood where Barney had spent thousands of hours running and this time he just enjoyed the snfs and a lie down. Then we took him to McDonald’s where he enjoyed two cheeseburgers. But they knew they wanted Barney to slip away on his favourite spot on the sofa, and said their vet Steph did everything to ensure he could pass with them right by his side. She gave him a sedative and he just slipped away on his spot on where he slept all of his le, and then Steph gave him the last injection and he was gone. Weaposre so grateful to Steph to have allowed us the luxury of home care for Barney, it was so gentle, there was so much care taken over him. We know he wasnapost distressed but it broke our hearts and they’ve been broken ever since. It was the most awful honour to be able to help that last moment pass with dignity. Steph stepped out and let us have a lot of time with Barney afterwards and when we were ready, she wrapped him in a cosy blanket and carried him in her arms to her car. We have his ashes home now and we will always keep those. “Our home feels very empty with Barney, the leather settee he nibbled the covers off it still sitting with his blanket in place, his collar and lead are still hanging on the hook. “We’ve cried so many tears over this big dog, he was a gt to us and he held us together all of his le. He might have been a failed explosives dog but we knew his talents lay where, and so did he. His talent was to love and be loved and he excelled at it every moment of every day.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cafe Nero PLCDogsTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People had been queuing since am, even though we didn’t even open until .am. The vaccine centres were given no early warning about Boris Johnson’s announcement and had not been able to prepare for the sheer numbers of people turning up that we’ve been seeing since Sunday. It was like opening the floodgates and letting all the water come rushing through. When a service like this relies on volunteers – people who have jobs and who aren’t always available – it’s been a logistical nightmare to get people to help.And when it comes to the queues, while most people are happy to accept there will be a wait, there are still people who think itaposs worth their while to shout at the staff helping. That doesn’t help anyone, so to calm things down I tell them that Iaposm a volunteer and just trying to do my best.  I’ve been helping out at my local vaccine centre, at a clinic in Crouch End, North London, since January. Iaposm normally there once a week with a clipboard at the door helping check people in, taking their temperature and directing them to where they need to go. It got me out of the house when everyone  was locked down, it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience and I’ve met people I would have never normally talked to in my daily le. While the NHS may be providing the vaccine service, it relies on volunteers to run it smoothly, from data inputting to greeting, to even giving people vaccines.  One of the biggest issues we’ve had over the last few days has been the sheer number of walk ins – particularly when they start impacting on waiting times for people who have booked. At my instigation, at our clinic we now have two queues so that people who have booked times aren’t waiting as long. While it can be stressful, a busy day at the vaccine clinic can be exciting. Everyone is working closely as a team, there’s an adrenaline rush, as well as a huge satisfaction in knowing that we are helping, that people will feel safer when they leave. But we also have to be extra careful not to make mistakes.  One of the hardest things is keeping on top of who is allowed a vaccine and when. There are strict rules about how long it should be since their last vaccine, there are also age limits and no amount of pleading from them can make us give them the jab - we aren’t making the rules. I’ve had people break down in tears because they can’t have their jab. They swear that they know more than us that we are telling them a lie. That’s one of the hardest things - I really didn’t sign up to stand around in the freezing cold for hours at a time to be shouted at. But usually people are calm and grateful – at the start of the vaccine programme they would even bring us chocolates and cakes. It’s immensely satisfying to be part of this huge push to keep everyone safe and I would recommend it to anyone who can help.

Depraved Fuller, , beat and strangled Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , to death before sexually assaulting them in two separate attacks in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in . He also abused  dead bodies in the mortuaries of hospitals over more than a decade, his sentencing hearing at Maidstone Crown Court was told. The ages of the victims ranging from  to -years-old. The mother of a nine-year-old girl abused in the hospital mortuary by Fuller after she died said in court: It makes my skin crawl and it really does break my heart. I feel sick. I can’t sleep. It will haunt me forever.  Fuller filmed himself carrying out the attacks inside the now-closed Kent and Sussex Hospital and the Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Pembury, where he worked in electrical maintenance roles since . Investigators have so far detected around  potential victims but admitted all their identities may never be known. He also pleaded guilty to  other offences, including  charges relating to  identied victims, including three children, in mortuaries between  and November . It was only when searching Fulleraposs house after arresting him for murder did detectives find proof of his warped crimes. They discovered hard drives with more than  million images of distressing sexual offences, which included images of him sexually assaulting dead bodies. The hospital electrician was convinced he would never serve justice for two murders and the sexual assault of over  corpses but in  things finally unravelled.After a check of the national database showed a close match to  people, cops whittled it down - eventually identying Fulleraposs brother, before finding the killer himself. Mrs Knellaposs mother Pamela Jones Knell read out an impact statement in court. Wendy was a caring thoughtful at times a bit scatty person who would do anything for anyone similar to me, she said. Always smiling, tall and skinny when young, when playing netball she came home with scraped. As she got older she always worked hard went to college did her exams.  She got a job and her employer asked her to look after children. She always wanted children. If she had children at least we would have had a part of her. I realised something went wrong, when I realised she never went to work that day. I never expected the reason would be she was dead. I rang my husband Bill who went to the flat and when he got there he told police his daughter lived inside and they told him there was a girl inside who was dad. You never expect to be told your daughter is dead. Katrina Frost, Caroline Pierceaposs mum, also spoke in court and said: My daughter Caroline was a typical teenager, just coming out of her rebellious stage. We agreed to meet for lunch after months. But now it became the most horric part of my le and a nightmare that continues to this day. I have had to endure  years of not know why anyone would do this. I never forgot racing across Kent having to identy the damaged body of my own flesh and blood. I can still recall the horror of seeing her body and what happened to her. She didn’t deserve what happened to her or being taken away from her family. She doesn’t deserve what this animal did to her. She must have been terried when she died.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Caroline PierceHospitalsDavid Fuller\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Laura Ward, , spent seven weeks in a coma before waking up to discover she had already given birth to her healthy baby girl, Hope. But the mum of two from Tyldesley, Wigan, still had to learn to walk, talk, feed and clean herself all over again as a result of the toll the virus took on her body, Manchester Evening News reports.After finally being discharged from hospital nearly five months since she was admitted, Laura, was greeted by her husband, John Leece, their children, parents and friends as she ed home in time for Christmas.  The adorable clip shows brave Laura stepping out of a car with a walker as her family, surrounded by balloons and hand-made posters with well-wishing messages, cheer her on and clap. Laura said: Iaposm so pleased to be home. The physiotherapist brought me home and John was there waiting for me with the kids. William was so excited he was shouting aposmummy, mummyapos and trying to get in the car. The teaching assistant first started feeling unwell as she finished school for the summer holidays this year with a bit of a cough. But when Lateral Flow Tests came back negative and her symptoms only worsened, Laura took a PCR test which ed a positive result. As she struggled to breathe, Laura was admitted at the Royal Bolton Hospital and was warned by maternity staff that they may have to deliver her baby early as she continued to decline over the next two weeks. Now the last thing she remembers is waking up on September  to learn that she had given birth to Hope via emergency C-section at  weeks while in an induced coma. She said: I opened my eyes to see Hope on the bed with me, but I couldnapost move any part of my body. All I could do was shake and nod my head. At its worst, the terrying ordeal saw doctors warn Lauraaposs family that she could dieshe didnapost get on an ECMO Machine, adding that it was the last resort for her. Not wanting to name their baby girl without her mumaposs involvement, partner, John, , referred to Hope only as baby girl in the weeks until Laura woke up. But having had a tracheotomy, feeding tubes fitted and spending  days on an ECMO Machine - the highest form of le support - Laura had a gruelling recovery learning how to do the most basic things before she was fit and healthy enough to go home.  She said: I was just lying in bed at first and not able to move at all. I tried really hard to lt my arms but I just couldnapost. It was frustrating because I couldnapost speak, but because I couldnapost move my arms or hands, I wasnapost able to write anything down that I wanted to say either. I had to learn to feed myself, brush my teeth, all the things you learn as a toddler, itaposs like learning everything all over again.  Finally ing to see her family and friends again on Monday, Laura was re-united with her parents Lynn and Bill, her three year old son, William, baby Hope and her two step-children.Now she says sheaposd recommend the jab to any pregnant women. Iaposd say just get it, she said. I wouldnapost wish whataposs happened to me on anyone and itaposs better to be safe than sorry.

Every winter there is a rise in common colds and other respiratory infections.Earlier in the Autumn Brits were dealing with theworst cold ever , after theto schools and the end of coronavirus restrictions. But now coronavirus infections are rising, and with the new Omicron iant on the rise, Brits need to make sure their colds arenapost actually Covid.Although believed to be more transmissible, there have been reports that Omicron is causing mild symptoms. So how can you be sure itaposs a cold and not Covid  Hereaposs everything you need to know. What are the symptoms of Omicron   The symptoms of the Omicron iant of coronavirus appear to be very dferent from previous strains, according to researchers. Some are reporting mild symptoms that are dferent the Delta strain.Early reports show Omicron has five district symptoms of its own, which are:A scratchy throat sore throat A dry cough Extreme tiredness Mild muscle aches Night sweatsHowever, according to the NHS website, there are still three main recognised symptoms of Covid. They are: A high temperature A new, continuous cough A loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteWhat are the symptoms of a cold   According to the NHS, the symptoms of a cold can come on gradually, and include:A blocked or runny nose A sore throatHeadachesMuscle aches Coughs A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smellHow can you tell the dference between a cold and Covid   As many of the symptoms of Covid and a cold are the same, it can be tricky to know which ones you have. Professor Tim Spector previously appeared on This Morning to clear up any confusion.He explained to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: “Many people - perhaps up to half of cases - are going unrecognised because they basically have symptoms that are very cold-like. So headache, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing - and the only one that gets into the top five is loss of smell or taste.Weaposre now seeing that fever is very low down on the ranking of what weaposre seeing at the moment. Even rarer are things like shortness of breath or a persistent cough. Itaposs a combination of factors but weaposve got to face the reality which is, most people out there with Covid are presenting with cold-like symptoms.” What should you doyou have Covid symptoms   Itaposs incredibly important thatyou have any of the symptoms of Covid-, including the ones associated with Omicron, you should get tested. Professor Tim Spector, from Britain’s Covid Zoe app, said it was more important than ever to get tested. Data from the Zoe study app suggests that about half of all the Delta cases are being missed because they donapost present the classic Covid symptoms. He added: Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild iants we’re seeing in people who have been vaccinated with delta than anything . And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people won’t recognise as Covidthey just believe the official government advice. Professor Irene Petersen, a professor of epidemiology and health informatics at University College London , added: “A runny nose and headache are symptoms of many infections, but may also be the first symptoms – and only symptoms – of Covid. Therefore,you have these symptoms, I’d encourage you to use lateral flow testsfor a couple of days.The only way to know the dference for sure is to take a Covid test. You can order a free PCR test off the government website.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The group of students, which included at least one man, claim they were targeted at the Val Thorens resort and could have had a substance slipped into their drinks.Another incident was reported to have taken place two days earlier, according to the Daily Mail.Joe Hilton, co-president of the Varsity Trip ski holiday, said the spikings could have been carried out by Oxbridge students after it emerged that the incidents at the ‘Slipped Disc’ club night happened before am, when the general public was allowed in. One student told Cambridge University newspaper Varsity: I do not know why there is the presumption that Oxbridge students cannot spike people and it must be locals – this happened early on a student night.But another wrote on Facebook that a group of middle-aged men with seemingly no relation to the Varsity Trip had been allowed into the club with no pat-down search .There were reports of a large crowd of what seemed like locals trying to get into the club via the back entrance and that there was presence from Nuco, which organised the trip for , students. A student wrote on a social media group that their friend had been spiked at Malaysia with a needle, according to Varsity, while Nuco posted warnings, saying it has increased door searches.  At am on Friday, Oxford law student Maeve Carroll posted on Facebook: There are now five girls we are aware of who have been spiked by injections drinks tonight. Nuco and security are aware but seem to be doing not much. There were also comments from female students, some who were so scared that they said they had put on long sleeve tops and coats to protect themselves. None of the alleged incidents had been reported to the police yet, according to Mr Hilton. Nuco Travel added that its staff had taken over the door at the venue after reports of spikings and aggressive door staff who reportedly turned away  people despite having tickets.

It sees her throw a huge Christmas lunch for all her loved ones at Buckingham Palace - with about  members of The Firm attending aposs festivities. This year, the party will reportedly hopefully take place next Tuesday at Windsor Castle, rather than Buckingham Palace, where the Queen is currently in residence.It is said it will see Her Majesty host an evening with wine, crackers and a feast inside the castle with extended family — before going to Sandringham, Norfolk, for Christmas itself. And even though children such as Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Mia Tindall are invited to the event, they donapost sit with the other royals. Instead, they have their own room, where they enjoy their Christmas meal, according to Mike Tindall, husband of the Queenaposs granddaughter Zara Tindall.In , the former rugby player spoke about the celebrations on his rugby podcast, and shared a few exciting details.

His co-stars James Haskell and Alex Payne asked which of the seven tables he sat. They asked: Do you find yourself upgrading every year and getting closer to the main table or are you off out the back  Is there a promotion and relegation based on the yearaposs performance  Becausethere is I imagine youaposre pretty much sitting on the right-hand side of Her Majesty. Mike stayed quiet throughout the jokes, but later added: I was on Prince Charlesaposs table, it was lovely.  He then ulged that the royal little ones have their own table in a separate room away from the adults. He said: This is the family lunch, there were seven tables so there must have been about  of us there. The kiddies have their own little one in a dferent room. It is understood that this year, three of her four newest great-grandchildren - August Brooksbank, Lucas Tindall and Sienna Mapelli Mozzi - are expected to be at the party. The Queen will then go to Sandringham via helicopter for Christmas.Last month, the Queen told her family she is well enough to host Christmas at Sandringham after recovering from a back sprain.She assured them she is feeling “far better” and is “looking forward” to the traditional festive get together at her Norfolk estate. Concern for the Queen’s health has been heightened in recent months after she pulled out of a number of major engagements.

With many people in festive spirits they have been heading out to parties and drinks with friends before new restrictions are introduced in an attempt to slow the spread of the Omicron iant. In Portsmouth hundreds of people flocked to a themed night at the Astoria nightclub. People could be seen dressed up in their Christmas gear with plenty of Father Christmases and some snowmen on show. And it was not just Tuesday night as last weekend thousands were out in towns and cities for festive fun.  Little regard was taken for the highly contagious new Covid iant which is forcing the new rules from Wednesday. People will need to show that they have had two vaccine doses or a negative test in order to go into nightclubs and some other venues. The government has said that lateral flow tests should be used by people entering “high-risk settings like crowded places.  Nightclub owners have hit out at the new restrictions saying that a lack of rapid COVID- tests will make enforcement a big challenge.Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his Plan B measures to tackle the spread of the Omicron iant.The UK has registered almost , cases of Omicron, with  people hospitalised and one person dying after contracting the iant.  New rules were passed in Parliament on Tuesday though  members of Johnsonaposs own party voted against them. Kate Fuller, who owns the Electric Ballroom nightclub in Camden in north London said the lack of available rapid testing is a problem for her. Since the announcement of the restrictions, our business just took a massive downturn, she said.  Thereaposs no testing in a lot of the pharmacies. If you canapost get the tests, itaposs going to be really hard for people to come. I think for our security and everything, implementing these is just going to be, you know, a big challenge. The new rules will apply to unseated indoor events with  people or more, unseated outdoor events with over , people and events with more than , attendees.  Clara Cullen, venue support manager at charity Music Venue Trust, which supports around  music venues in the country, said there had been an increase in cancellations with income falling by % in the past week. There will be financial implications to trying to implement the Plan B, said Cullen.

As the country recovers from snow and gales from Storms Arwen and Barra, the mild temperatures have continued over the past few days after it reached a balmy C last weekend. Temperatures are expected to plummet to below freezing next week over Christmas, according to WXCharts, as a weather system is forecasted to bring frost and foggy conditions. Brits have been warned that another named storm could hit over this period, with the potential to bring mph gales, rain and a drop in temperature next week. It comes after Storms Arwen and Barry killed at least four people and caused widespread chaos, with tens of thousands of homes losing power. Forecasters have said the chances are not high of a white Christmas, with the Met Office predicting a “predominantly dry and settled” period in the days leading up to the holiday.However, a British Weather Services forecaster has said the potential for snow after Christmas was high, with the possibility of a white New Year. A cloud cover is expected to reduce as the year draws to a close, with a corresponding increase in the risk of overnight fog and frost as we move past Christmas.  According to Met Office forecasting, there will be rain at times in the far north and northwest over this period, along with some stronger winds. Temperatures would hover around or just below average, with mild weather expected in the north and colder conditions in the south. Overnight frost and fog was likely in places heading towards the New Year, with unsettled spells most likely for the northwest.The Met Office stated: “Heading deeper into January there is expected to be a gradual sht towards more changeable conditions, especially in the northwest, and turning milder again too.” Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge told the Mirror an area of high pressure, a bit like a dome, would become increasingly established and will sit over the UK over and well beyond Christmas.  It will create conditions that might provide a lot of cloud, Mr Madge said. There might be some drizzle and patchy rain from that, but we’re not expecting anything drastic. Mr Madge said temperatures would also drop over this period.Jim Dale, of British Weather Services told the Express : “The main two factors in the short term will be dry weather and fog. At times the fog will be dense and will sit in valleys. The main hazard will be ice on roads, this side of Christmas,” said Mr Dale. He continued: It will be a pseudo white Christmas. This means frost instead of snow. It will certainly be cold enough for snow, but there will be less moisture in the air to form snow. The weather will become progressively colder as we move towards Christmas.” Mr Dale said: After Christmas, there is a northeasterly cold air coming. It will get properly cold after Christmas with the possibility of a white New Year. The potential for snow will be high after Christmas. There is a cold pool over Europe and we could be left open to this polar air over the New Year.  UK forecast for the next  days Today: Some sunshine in northern Scotland, north Wales, and parts of northern and eastern England. Many other areas cloudy some rain across west and south Scotland, Northern Ireland and Cumbria, and patchy drizzle in the south. Mild. Windy in the north. Tonight: Rain pushing northeastwards across western and northern parts of Scotland. Still a little drizzle possible in the south. Some cloud breaks in between, which may lead to some fog patches. Thursday: Any fog in central and eastern England may be slow to clear. Some sunshine possible, mainly parts of northeastern UK. Still damp in the far north. Elsewhere cloudy but dry. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Mostly dry but rather cloudy. A few sunny intervals, while clear spells by night could allow patchy fog. Winds mostly light but temperatures trending downwards, with patchy night frost possible.

MPs voted on Plan B Covid restrictions on Tuesday as Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced all countries would be removed from the UK red list. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned a huge spike is on the way, with Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty telling the cabinet he expects a signicant rise in hospitalisations driven by the Omicron iant.The latest Covid data showed , new infections were reported in the UK on Tuesday, which is up from , reported the week before on December  - the highest rate of new cases since January Plan B restrictions are currently in force across the UK. Measures designed to combat the Omicron iant have thus far included new guidance related to face masks and working from home. Compulsory vaccines for health and social care workers are also due to be introduced from April . However, the Prime Minister had to stare down a rebellion from his own backbenchers who disagreed with some Plan B proposals, including COVID passes. It was the worst rebellion against the government since he became PM.However, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer threw his support behind the governmentaposs Plan B this week - meaning restrictions were voted through.Can I travel and stay over at my familyaposs home this Christmas Christmas was essentially cancelled for many last year, with heartbreaking stories of those isolated alone hitting the news. But this year, there are currently no restrictions in place which would prevent you from travelling to visit your loved ones this Christmas, so long as you are not forced to self-isolate due to a positive Covid result or other mandatory quarantine reason. No plans have been outlined by the PM or his ministers suggesting there are plans to introduce restrictions on domestic travel over the festive period. Mr Johnson has promised, this Christmas will be considerably better than that of . However, new Covid rules have been introduced across the UK in a bid to respond to the rapidly rising rates of Omicron.What happensI test positive while at my familyaposs home this Christmas If you have any symptoms of coronavirus, including a high temperature, a new and continuous cough or a loss change in your sense of taste or smell, you are required to self-isolate immediately. You are also required to get a PCR test as soon as possibleyou have any of the above symptoms. If you test positive for COVID-, you have the virus and therefore must self-isolate at whatever location you are currently residing in. This means,you test positive while at your familyaposs home over the festive period, you must remain there for  days starting from the day your symptoms began or the day you had the testyou did not have symptoms.You can find out more about how long to self-isolate here.If you have tested positive you should inform the NHS and anyone you have been in close contact with for the past  hours to ensure they can get tested. These contacts are not required to self-isolate unless they are contacted by the NHS Test and Trace service.  Does everyone in your family home or household have to self-isolateyou test positive for COVID- If you live with someone with Covid, you will not need to self-isolateyou meet any of the following criteria: you are fully vaccinated , you are under  years and six months old, you are taking part or have taken part in a Covid vaccine trial or you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons. If iniduals meet any of the above conditions, those fully vaccinated are advised to do daily rapid lateral flow tests for seven days, limit social contact with anyone at higher risk from Covid and follow advice on how to avoid catching and spreading the virus. However, NHS Test and Trace will contact anyone who has come into contact with someone with Covid by phone, email, text or through the NHS Covid- app and inform themthey need to self-isolate. If someone is contacted by NHS Test and Trace, they are required to self-isolate, eventhey are fully vaccinated. NHS Test and Trace will advise iniduals on the self-isolation procedures depending on their vaccination status.  What do I dosomeone in my household tests positive  Do I need to isolate as well  The government updated its guidance on Tuesday. It reads: If you live in the same household as someone with COVID-, and you are aged over  years and  months and not fully vaccinated, you are legally required to self-isolate. This does not applyyou have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID- vaccine trial or you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons. Do not go to work, school, or public areas and do not use public transport or taxis. Your isolation period includes the day the first person in your household’s symptoms startedand the next  full days. This means that , for example, your  day isolation period starts on the th of the month, your isolation period ends at .pm on the th and you canto your normal routine. The government reiterated that they class a household as either:one person living alone a group of peopleliving at the same address and who share cooking facilities, bathrooms or toilets, or living areas and may include students in boarding schools or halls of residence groups of people who share a nomadic way of le for example those who live on Traveller sites, in vehicles or on canal boats WhatI get the Omicron Covid iant Omicron is rapidly becoming the most dominant iant around parts of the country and therefore positive cases are likely to be this new strain. It is likely to become the dominant strain in the UK in a matter of days. The rules for Omicron and other Covid iants are all the same - and therefore you do not need to take any extra stepsyou have Omicron or not. The World Health Organisationhas said PCR tests can detect Omicron infections. The Omicron iant has multiple mutations to its spike protein, which is found on the virus’s surface. The spike protein plays a role in infecting cells and most PCR tests target several parts of the viral genome, including the S-gene that encodes the spike protein. The new iant appears to cause milder cold-like symptoms. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here.Can I travel abroad this Christmas The red travel list will be scraped in England, according to the Health Secretaryaposs announcement on Tuesday. Mr Javid revealed it will no longer be necessary to block arrivals from the  banned countries where Omicron has been discovered, given there are now thousands of cases of the iant already in Britain. In terms of travelling abroad, you are able to travel abroad as you wish - depending on the rules of the country you intend to travel to. There are currently  countries that have essentially banned UK visitors, including Australia and New Zealand. Can I take daily tests and leave isolation early If your rapid lateral flow test comes back positive, you should continue to self-isolate until you get the result of the PCR test. Evenyour PCR test is negative, you may need to quarantine. In England,you do the PCR test within two days of a positive rapid lateral flow test and your PCR test is negative, you can stop self-isolating. If you do the PCR test later than this, youaposll need to self-isolate for  full days evenyou get a negative PCR result.What should you do about childcareyou have to self-isolate Those aged under  years and six months old are not required to self-isolatethey live with or have been in contact with someone with Covid. According to the latest guidance, anyone aged five years and over who lives in the same household as someone with COVID- and who is not legally required to self-isolate is now strongly advised to take a lateral flow test every day for seven days. If any of these LFD tests are positive they should self-isolate in order to protect other people. WhatI need to go to work to pay my bills You are required to stay at homeyou have tested positive for coronavirus - this means you cannot go to work, school, other public areas or use public transport.The government says you may be entitled to a one-off payment of £ through the NHSTest and Trace Support Payment schemeyou are required to stay at home and self-isolate and unable to go to work.

This dference - a deletion in the S gene - shows up in certain laboratory PCR tests and can be used as way of estimating the spread of Omicron. Of the , Covid- cases in London recorded on December  and  where the S gene status could be determined,  were classed as SGTF.  The figures, which have been published by the UK Health Security Agency, also show that .% of a sample of detectable cases in eastern England from December  and  were classed as SGTF, along with .% in south-east England and .% in north-west England. A graph put together by Oliver Johnson, Professor of Information Theory at the School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, plots the Covid cases reported by London onto a graph. Publishing it on Twittter, he said “since we know that omicron is growing at a similar rate in most regions, with ious places being about a week behind London.  Then it might be prudent to imagine that the next few places on this list might also see a big steepening in cases in the next week.” Levels were lower in all other regions, with north-east England having the lowest estimate of .%. The level for the whole of England was estimated at .%. All figures are based only on samples tested at four of the UK Lighthouse laboratories - Alderley Park, Glasgow, Milton Keynes and Newcastle - which means there are likely to be parts of the country where the prevalence of Omicron is underreported. Prof Tim Spector, an epidemiologist, told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, itaposs far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold.“We’re seeing doubling in the numbers equivalent to what’s being seen where, every two-and-a-half days, and that really means numbers are going up. “If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we’ve seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant iant already. “We’ll be at  per cent very soon, so that’s happened in just a matter of days – that’s is why so many people are going down with infections.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Joleen Diaz, , from Calornia in the US, puts her youthful glow down to old-fashioned clean living. Originally from Guam, the high school teacher and mum-of-one moved to Calornia when she was  and has been single since splitting from daughter Meilani’s father  years ago. The Calornia local gets younger men sliding into her DMs on a regular basis, however she claims her youthful beauty has also meant people keep reporting her Hinge profile because they think sheaposs a catfish. “I’ve had my account deleted several times,” Joleen said. “It’s funny, I think people think I’m a fake account and report me.“I could link my Instagram to my profile, which would likely help prove that it’s really me but I don’t do it because I think my social media doesn’t present the simple, down-to-earth person I am.  “I’d like to be able to connect with someone and then explain my social media to them once they know me a bit more.aposJoleen isnapost short for male suitors, with over , followers on Instagram @joleendiazand frequent date invitations.“I do get younger men messaging me on my social media,” she said. “The majority of the messages are very polite and most are very complimentary and positive about me promoting a positive lestyle. “They do ask to go out on a date, maybe dinner or a hike, but I know that this is just curiosity and not a real intent on pursuing anything more than the narrative they think of me. “When younger men ask me out on dates, I find it equally as flattering as men my age or older asking me out. “I think it takes a lot of courage to approach someone and ask them to meet with you one-on-one. “I think some younger men tend to fantasise a bit more about what it would be like dating someone older, where men my age or older are more pragmatic and looking for someone to enjoy simple things in le.apos However, Joleen isn’t interested in dating a toyboy. The mum said: “Age isn’t a deal-breaker for me, it’s about finding someone I’m able to help continue becoming a better person and growing, and them doing the same for me. “But I don’t want to date a toyboy. “I would never even remotely consider dating someone who is young enough to be friends with my daughter.” Joleen and Meilani are so close that when they are both in relationships they love going on double dates together. The mum said: “When we are both seeing people we will often go bowling, to the movies, hikes, to the beach. “We haven’t gone on a double date recently but she and I are very close so we definitely will again. “Melani asks for my advice on dating all the time. “I love that she trusts in the advice I give, I feel like she’s well-balanced in dating and I’m glad my experiences can help her out.” If anyone out there is considering sliding into Joleen’s DMs, she has some stipulations on the type of men she prefers. The mum added: “I gravitate towards ambitious, motivated men, someone who is confident, has a positive outlook and can communicate well. “They must be able to contribute equally, both financially and emotionally, in a relationship and they have to love dogs as I have a golden retriever. “They also must love being outdoors and being physically active.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationLoveSecondary schoolDating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When it arrived, Lily couldnapost wait to open the box but as soon as she did she was disappointed - as the tree looked sparse at the top and only got worse on the way down. Lily shared a video of her tree with her fans on TikTok and soon the video had been viewed more than three million times, with countless likes and comments.  What do you think about Lilyaposs Christmas tree  Let us know in the comments...Lily captioned her video: Kmart Australia, you have some explaining to do. She then shows the tree she bought, which instead of looking luscious as she thought it would, the tree barely had any branches and it attracted criticism online. One laughed and said it looked like “seaweed” but others said Lily simply needed to fluff out the tree. In a follow-up video, she did just that but complained the item still looked sad. But, eventually, Lily was able to make it work by enlisting a friend’s help and decorating the tree. She managed to cover the articial tree with baubles and tinsel which did the job.While Lily was disappointed, one British family got the fright of their le when a poisonous snake poked its head out from behind a bauble on their tree.Rob and Marcela Wild were admiring the tree with children Edward, , and Sahara, six, when they spotted the deadly boomslang nestle between the tinsel at their home in Cape Town, South Africa.

One woman has revealed how her sister-in-law is charging a price per head for hosting a second Christmas dinner at her house, which many people would argue is fair enough - except people are completely ided on the price. The woman explained how she and her husband have hosted Christmas dinner for the family three times in the past, and during these times her sister-in-law has brought a course, a bottle of wine or even possibly offered £ towards the cost, but any food or drink they bring that isnapost consumed, theyaposll take home with them again.

The youngster managed to order ,worth of ice cream and cakes from Sydney’s Gelato Messina , including a personalised birthday cake. His dad Kris King said that the mammoth order included  cakes - and he thinks he was pre-planning for his upcoming birthday. Christian ordered the huge amount of food to his Mr Kingaposs workplace at the nearby fire station.“First of all I thought it was . And then I really looked at it and it was , and we almost had a bloody heart attack,” Mr King told Perth Now. “I flicked through the screen about  times. That’s how long the order was, it was like  cakes. “He actually told me he ordered a birthday cake for himself, and I didn’t even believe it. “I had steam coming out of my ears first of all, screaming his name down the street. He ran to his room before I told him so.” But despite the horror of realising what his son had done, Mr Kingaposs day was saved after UberEats agreed to pay the money back. Mr King had told Christian that Santa might not be delivering presents to their home this year after the massive order. “The icing on the cake was when UberEats said we’ll give you your money back,” Mr King said.  “ back in the good books and Santa is coming again.” And Christian wasnapost the only person who could have ended up on Santaaposs naughty list.In the UK a woman has taken to Mumsnet to ask what to do about her husband, who keeps giving their son his Christmas presents early. She said: Iaposve been saving my pennies for months and been so careful about what gts I pick for my son because I wanted things I know he would love and appreciate. I ended up with about four presents for him but each and everyone was thought out and special. I just want to make it a lovely memory for him and us... Only problem is my husband. About a week or two ago I left my husband to watch my son for a couple hours while I went to the hospital for an appointmentwhen I came back my husband had found hidden presents and opened it and gave it to my son!I was a bit annoyed but not too unhappy as it was only a bubble bath set so not one of the main presents! This morning however Iaposve woken up to my son playing with the most expensive and the present I was most excited about to see his reaction when he opens it on Christmas morning!She added: Iaposve saved and shopped and planned everything to make this special and he keeps ruining it! I donapost have a lot of money to keep replacing gts at this rate my little one will have nothing left to open on Christmas Day. More than  people responded to her post, with many outraged by the husbandaposs behaviour.

The Parker Solar Probe touched the sun when it breached the outer atmosphere, and managed to sample particles and magnetic fields there.The new milestone marks one major step for Parker Solar Probe and one giant leap for solar science, according to a NASA release. The probe faced unimaginable temperatures of Fand radiation  times stronger than here on Earth. The flight occurred in April but scientists have only just been able to confirm the probe traveled through the corona. They had to wait months for the data to arrive back from the spacecraft. The achievement will help us uncover critical information about our closest star and its influence on the solar system, scientists said.  Parker Solar Probe apostouching the Sunapos is a monumental moment for solar science and a truly remarkable feat, said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for NASAaposs Science Mission Directorate, in a statement at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Not only does this milestone provide us with deeper insights into our Sunaposs evolution andimpacts on our solar system, but everything we learn about our own star also teaches us more about stars in the rest of the universe. New research gathered from the solar milestone, which cost NASA .billion, has now been included in the Physical Review Letters.  Fascinatingly exciting, said project scientist Nour Raouafi of Johns Hopkins University. As it circles closer to the solar surface, Parker is making new discoveries that other spacecraft were too far away to see, including from within the solar wind – the flow of particles from the Sun that can influence us at Earth. The first and most dramatic time we were below for about five hours... Now you might think five hours, that doesnapost sound big, the University of Michiganaposs Justin Kasper told reporters.  But he noted that Parker was moving so fast it covered a vast distance during that time, tearing along at more than  milesper second. The first passage through the corona – and the promise of more flybys to come – will continue to provide data on phenomena that are impossible to study from afar. Iaposm excited to see what Parker finds as it repeatedly passes through the corona in the years to come, said Nicola Fox, ision director for the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters. The opportunity for new discoveries is boundless. It is a really important region to get into because we think all sorts of physics potentially turn on, Kasper said. And now weaposre getting into that region and hopefully going to start seeing some of these physics and behaviors.

In a statement, the force said: During the investigation, it was found that dolphins and whales were utilized for entertainment purposes during the month of August, without being authorized to do so following an amendment to the Criminal Code under Bill S- on June , . Animal rights group Animal Justice claimed the investigation into Marineland had been sparked by its own legal complaint about the water park over concerns its dolphin performances violated the Criminal Code.

Back in October, Camille Labchuk, executive director of Animal Justice, said: Authorities must step in to investigate whether Marineland’s dolphin performances violate federal laws protecting dolphins from being forced to participate in demeaning performances. Speaking to Global News on Monday, she added that the group is concerned for the safety and wellbeing of animals still at the park amid reports Marineland is up for sale. The group has called on the government to intervene and rescue the animals still living at Marineland so they can be sent to a sanctuarythe park is sold.

I can understand that this must be absolutely hellish.“In the short term we need to do something immediately about trying to discourage people from parking in inappropriate places and I’m more than happy to take that forward to the community action teamwith the police.“I think in the medium term we need to be trying to encourage people, when there are peak times, to not park there but to park down in the town.”Also at this week’s meeting was Emma Guy from Enduro World Series , who formerly worked as project coordinator for the Tweed Valley Tourism Bid..removeShe said: “I’m well aware of this issue and some of us [from Tweed Valley Tourism Bid] did try and tackle it on the ground about a year and a half ago with putting signs up near the Cauld.“So around the event at the beginning of October we had shuttles so people wouldn’t park in these hotspots, we cordoned off areas, we spoke to the golf club and we had marshals in place to police any bad behaviour, so tat worked quite well.“Our kind of feeling is that this is an ongoing problem and it does need solutions, there needs to be some kind of visitor infrastructure investment and certainly in my role with the Tourism Bid we were pushing really hard for that.“From an EWS point of view, with regard to events, we worked quite hard to manage that problem because we know how disruptive and how unpleasant that can be.“In my role with EWS we would support and put our weight behind any proposals to the council to SOSEto try and alleviate this.”Tweeddale East councillor Shona Haslam, of the Conservatives, added: “In terms of the long term [solution] obviously we’ve got £ million coming into mountain biking infrastructure into Innerleithen and £ million for a town the size of Innerleithen is pretty signicant.“So, we’ve got the Mountain Biking Innovation Centre that is moving forward in the background, obviously there’s a lot of commercial stuff in there that we’re not allowed to talk about, and there is the bike park as well.

Here, members of the school’s higher journalism class interview some of the winners and those involved on the day...Headteacher’s messageThis year we celebrate our amazing young people and their astounding achievements in their studies through the medium of the printed press. Is it the same as enjoying the embarrassment of your granny cheering from the front row  Or as rewarding as seeing the pride on the faces of family members as you collect your certicate on stage with a smile and a handshake  Of course not. Nothing about school le post-fire post during COVID seems as rewarding or real as it once did but, be in no doubt, the young people celebrated here today are every bit as worthy of celebration and congratulations as their predecessors and perhaps even more so given all they have had to overcome and deal with to win the prizes we celebrate in this article.Perhaps you can take heart that this year’s Peebles High School prize giving offers something more permanent than fleeting moments of adulation and applause. It offers an article than can be cherished for years to come as a reminder of how our young people triumphed against the odds. Who knows, perhaps in years to come one of this year’s prize winners will be a granny or grandpa waving this copy of the Peeblesshire in the front row shouting, “I won that same prize in – prizes really meant something in my day.” Perhaps that is a bit fancul but, as your head teacher, I want to thank each and every one of you for succeeding in tough times and bringing such pride and honour to our school. Well done.And well done too to our higher journalism class and their teacher, Ms Ness, for the hard work that brings you this celebration of our fantastic young people.

I urge all of the pupils to enjoy their time at the school, reach out for help and support when it is needed, and never stop chasing their dreams.“Congratulations to all the award winners, your hard work and dedication has been rightly recognised.

The winner of the Maigret Cup this year is Thomas Neville. Thomas has won this award through his success studying Spanish and French at Higher level. The class was fortunate enough to interview Thomas regarding the award and asked him how he felt to have won this. He said: “I’m really impressed with myself, obviously the award for overall linguist is really prestigious, and I’m really chuffed with myself as there is obviously a lot of languages at this school so to have won the best overall award for languages is something that I’m really proud of.”By Harry NessAmy Brown: Outstanding Musical ContributionOn November  the class interviewed former Peebles High School student Amy Brown to discuss her achievement of the Outstanding Musical Contribution Award. This is presented in recognition of the huge commitment made to the extra curricular le of the school and is awarded to a pupil who have been a source of inspiration to their fellow musicians throughout their time at Peebles. She was delighted to have won, even though she only took music for enjoyment and went on to express her disappointment at not being able to perform fully last year. She graciously stated that she was glad pupils are “able to get back to that now and other people are enjoying it”. While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that “it’s not something I want to stop doing… It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more”. Amy then admitted at the risk of sounding “cliché”, that the music department concerts were the highlight of her years at the school. At the end of the interview, she imparted some very wise advice for younger years. She said: “Have more confidence in yourself, don’t care as much about what other people think.”By Madeleine HubertChristopher O’Hare: George OB Thomson Memorial CupThis award was created by professor George Thompson, who taught in the English department at Peebles High School. He devoted large parts of his research to the study of pupils with additional needs and was always adamant that they should be integrated into the “le and work of the whole school”. The council of Tweeddale wanted to celebrate the late professor George Thompson by awarding this memorial quaich to the most creative and enterprising entry from pupils with additional needs for a project devised by the school in conjunction with the society. When the class interviewed Christopher he said he felt “brilliant and honoured” to receive this award. He told us that one teacher that improved Christopher’s school le was Mr Travis, from the technology department. Christopher described him as a “funny guy” and “nice person”, who he says is happy to help whenever. He added that design and manufacture was his favourite subject as it enabled him to unleash his creativity. Not only is Christopher creative, but funny too, and when asked what his act in a school talent show would be he replied: “I like to make people laugh and feel happy”. Finally, Christopher was asked what he wishes to do in the future. Filled with energy, he stated that he would like to join the army. The skills and qualities which Christopher has shown in order to gain this award will help him achieve his future plans. The school wishes Christopher all the best, and know he will do well in the world which anxiously awaits his talent, kindness and phenomenal humour.By Keeley RippinBen Rorison: George OB Thomson Memorial Cup, and Balfour Medal This year’s worthy prize winner of the Balfour Medal and the George OB Thomson cup is Ben Rorison. Both prizes are awarded to an inidual with a positive presence and creative outlook within their community and school le. This was an area in which Ben excelled. When asked how he felt about receiving both awards Ben stated that he was “shocked and delighted to have been picked”. Ben also mentioned that his favourite subject was music and that he wanted to pursue this by becoming a music teacher for those with additional needs. When asked what his favourite memory was at Peebles High, Ben said is was helping first year pupils and helping around the school as a prefect, just showing how deserving of this prize Ben is. The positive impact that Ben had on the school will stay with those students he helped and the teachers he worked with. The school has no doubt that Ben will continue to be a role model and inspiration to all who are fortunate enough to work with him.By Olivia ThornburrowAbbie Sorrell: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectOne winner of the Geoffrey Simpson award is ex-head girl Abbie Sorrell. The class’ first question regarded the important issue of who her favourite teacher was. She replied: “I don’t really do favourites, butI had to choose it would be Lesley Johnson. Chemistry used to be one of my weaker subjects , however I learned to love it and always looked forward to her classes”. However, she may have been won over in another way as she finishes her reply with “cake days were always a firm favourite of mine too”.Abbie was asked what her favourite memory of Peebles High School was and she responded enthusiastically “the German exchange trip”. She added: “I went as a member of the choir and loved meeting like-minded people and embracing a dferent culture. Not to mention the infamous Loch Lomond song which was always a favourite of mine.”When asked about her future plans, Abbie replied: “Wow, thinking about the future seems so daunting, however I hope that my uni degree will allow me to work in a hospital environment where I can help people. I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.”The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with “the list is long… the main thing I’d say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success”. Carrying on the theme of advice Abbie was asked what she would say to this year’s head team and she told them to “embrace everything because the year will be over before you know it. Therefore, just make the most of every opportunity and most of all enjoy yourself and have fun working with your peers”.By Rosie DykesEuan Macrae: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectEuan Macrae was awarded the prestigious Geoffrey Simpson Award for his efforts as head boy. Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that “we’d never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting”. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as “she had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice. I soon realised that learning could be actually so much fun as well as informative”.By Louise RussellRachel McManus: Tweed Reads PrizeCampbell Hunter was a much-loved member of the Peebles community. He made fantastic contributions to the Tweed Reads organisation and thrived under the leadership role. He was kind, compassionate and showed a real love of encouraging the younger generations to explore and enjoy reading. Campbell worked tirelessly alongside the other members of Tweed Reads and valued the importance of learning, community and service. Campbell was such an important part of the community, and his astounding contribution to Tweed Reads only proved how far he was set to go outside of school.The Tweed Reads prize is named after Campbell Hunter, not just to honour his memory but to honour everything he stood for and his contributions to the Tweed Reads club. The prize is awarded to the few who epitomise Campbell’s wonderful leadership qualities and share his values of learning and community. The Campbell Hunter prize for  goes to Rachel McManus who consistently worked creatively within the confines of COVID regulations and was always relentlessly positive.When the class asked Rachel about the prize itself and how she felt to have won it, she described Campbell as “a huge part of Tweed Reads in his last few years of high school and had a real passion for helping young children in the community develop their reading skills and form a love for reading”. Rachel says she feels “honoured to have won the Campbell Hunter prize through Tweed Reads” and she hopes to continue her involvement with the organisation in coming years.When asked in an interview how the fire and pandemic affected her work ethic within school she replied it had “a massive impact on students”. She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has “worked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it”. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that “it was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload”.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbell’s legacy. She responded saying that it demonstrates all of the commitment he put into Tweed Reads and his caring nature over his home community.She added: “In my sixth year of high school I heard many stories of Campbell from Tweed Reads leaders who had worked alongside him. They always said how much commitment he had to the charity and how much he cared about truly representing the ethos of the charity so therefore I feel that the Campbell Hunter prize is a true legacy of all the hard work and dedication that he put into the charity.”By Rosie Dykes"},{"url":null,"title":"laws-implications-e-scooters","story":"POLICE in the Scottish Borders are warning anyone planning to purchase an e-scooter this Christmas to make sure they know the laws and implications beforehand.Using an e-scooter in a public place in Scotland is illegal.This includes roads, pavements, parks, town centres and promenades.

year, opting instead to spend the £ it would cost to dress a living Christmas tree next winter – “like every other town in East Lothian” – leaving the town without a tree this year.However, following a backlash by locals criticising the group’s failure to light up the town, the community group confirmed that a temporary tree would indeed be installed at Coronation Gardens later this week.Historically, a Christmas tree has been displayed at the war memorial however, due to ongoing refurbishment at Civic Square, the space cannot be decorated this year.Additionally, permanent lights – which the community council arranged to have installed on two trees in the town – have suffered delays due to Storm Arwen, but the group “remains hopeful this will be resolved soon”.An online statement by the group said: “The community council has become aware of a series of provocative posts on other local social media pages about the town’s Christmas lights.“The current community council was only formed in October, following public elections in September.“The previous committee took the decision in  not to pay out the usual £ for a temporary Christmas tree and put that money towards a living Christmas tree and towards permanently dressing with lights some mature living deciduous trees in the town.“The cost for tree-dressing is in the region of £, per tree.“Two trees were dressed for us by independent contractors in late autumn but are still awaiting connection to nearby lampposts by East Lothian Council electricians.“This is work the previous CC executive team valiantly attempted to have put in place for several months prior to their departure and the new CC executive team are still chasing for completion.”Following a review of the  lights for lampposts – currently stored away – a member discovered that many were in an unsuitable condition for display.The lights cost the team more than £, when purchased several years ago.Additionally, brackets and sockets to hang the lights are missing from lampposts.The statement added: “A decision was taken to trust that East Lothian Council would be good to its word for the - Christmas season and connect up the two new trees, allowing us to invest this money in dressing more permanent deciduous trees next year.”Fiona O’Donnell, ward councillor, said: “I am pleased that there will be some Christmas lights in Prestonpans this year.“I know that the community were keen to see this happen after such a dficult year.“Going forward, I want to work with the community council to explore how we make sure that there will be Christmas lights in future years.“We can learn from the example of the gala committee, who work all year round to make the Prestonpans Gala a real highlight of the year.“The exchanges on social media have been helpfulin explaining what is involved and how other communities arrange for lights in their area.“I think there is an understanding that having Christmas lights in the town will need volunteers fromthe local community.“Panners always step up when their community needs them and I am confident that we can work together to build on what we have this year and make it even better in future years.”The community council added: “It’s worth remembering that the members are unpaid volunteers.“Like those iniduals posting nonsense, we have jobs, lives, hobbies, family and other things to be getting on with too.“Like everyone who lives in the town, young or old, recent arrival or th-generation Panner, we all want to create a beautul, peaceful and happy town for us all to live, work and grow old in.”A number of Facebook users responded to the statement, with one stating: “Folk are going to voice their opinions as there has been no communication to inform the community that this decision was made.”Another said: “It’s a sad state of affairs when other community councils can organise to have lovely Xmas lights on lampposts but Prestonpans and Port Seton can’t.”Another said: “Why has it taken for comments made on other media pages for you to put up a statement  When were you going to let the town know we were not getting the Christmas lights

And make sure you test before you go.\"More details on this will be published later this week, however, the first minister did give some examples of the additional measures required by businesses. For retail, it will include \"ato the kind of protections from the start of the pandemic - like measures to avoid crowding and bottlenecks. This will include physical distancing, measures to control the flow of customers, and protective screens.\"For hospitality, \"it will mean for example, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing.\"The first minister said: \"Im not asking anyone to ‘cancel’ Christmas, but in the run up to and in the aftermath of Christmas, Im asking everyone to reduce, as far as possible and to a minimum, the contacts we have with people in other households.She added that the government was not issuing guidance on the size of gatherings on Christmas eve, Christmas day or Boxing Day, but advised that keeping gatherings as small as reasonable was sensible. There are currently two people in hospital with known Omicron, however this number is likely to be higher. The R number for Omicron could be above , according to Sturgeon, meaning it could be far more transmissible than Delta. The first minister said: \"The R number associated with Delta is around . But the R number for Omicron appears to be well over , and possibly above .\"She added that this was why Scotland was facing a \"tsunami\" of cases. PCR test results were down slightly over the past -hours, leading the first minister to urge people not to put off going for a PCR test. Sturgeon said: \", positive cases were reported yesterday – .% of all tests carried out.\"The number of PCR tests yesterday was lower than in recent days - I therefore want to appeal to people not to put off going for a PCR testyou have symptoms or a positive lateral flow.\"I know no-one wants to test positive or isolate at Christmas - but testing is a vital part of our defence and there is no shortage of capacity. So, please do get tested.\"The first minister confirmed that --year-olds will be invited to book their booster jabs from tomorrow. She added that the Scottish government aimed to reach % vaccine uptake among the population by the end of December. The additional capacity needed to administer these jabs will come through prioritising Covid boosters over the flu jab roll out. In addition, the requirement for people to wait in a vaccine centre for  minutes after receiving the Covid jab will be dropped.   "},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-give-second-update-tonight---time-watch-tv-address","story":"Earlier this afternoon the first minister gave her weekly Covid update to Parliament, during which she announced new measures in order to curb a rise in Omicron cases. These new measures included an urge to keep socialising to a maximum of three households, as well as new legal requirements for businesses to introduce measures to limit the spread of Covid. As we prepare for the first ministers second announcement of the day, heres what time to expect it and how to watch...Nicola Sturgeon will give a televised address to the nation at pm tonight. The address is titled \"A Response from the First Minister\" and described as \"A response from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland on the coronavirus pandemic.\"Nicola Sturgeons address will be broadcast live on BBC One Scotland tonight at pm. Since it is a pre recorded statement, it will be broadcast on STV an hour earlier at pm. In todays update to Parliament, the first minister warned of the damaging impact the Omicron iant could have on Scotland, with the R rate potentially above . As well as issuing new advice for the public and legal measures for businesses, Sturgeon urged people to come forward for PCR teststhey have symptoms. The government is urging people to keep socialising to a minimum of three households in the run up to and the aftermath of Christmas, however this is advice and therefore not required by law. Meanwhile, employers must enable working from home by law and new measures will be introduced for hospitality and retail.She also delivered an update on the booster jab roll out, confirming that --year-olds will be able to book their booster vaccine from tomorrow. Providing information about Christmas, the first minister said the the government was not issuing guidance on the size of gatherings on Christmas eve, Christmas day or Boxing Day, but advised that keeping gatherings as small as reasonable was sensible.  "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media -

Coming in at just under £, for the four-wheel-drive version, the Duster offers great value-for-money alongside genuine go-anywhere ability.These Duster models can only be specied in mid-level Comfort trim, which means you get a host of creature comforts as standard, including -inch wheels and an eight-inch infotainment display.Suzuki VitaraSuzuki, much like Dacia, is another manufacturer with a close eye on value. The Vitara has been a core part of the firms range for some time, but the most recent model has really moved the game forwards with a sharp new look and plenty of interior tech.But most importantly for this list, its available with Suzukis AllGrip all-wheel-drive system, which helps to give added traction while still maintaining a good level of economy.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover might have had a tricky job on its hands replacing the iconic Defender, but it appears that it has more than lived up to the challenge. The new Defender has captured some of the sparkle of the original but brought it into the modern age with a more refined driving experience without diminishing any of that much-needed off-road prowess.Available in short and long wheelbases - badged  and  respectively - the Defender is brimmed with off-road technology that allows it to adapt to and overcome all manner of conditions.Jeep WranglerJeeps Wrangler is something of an icon in the four-wheel-drive segment, having progressed and evolved from the original Willys Jeep. These days, its more grown-up than ever, but retains its robust and impressive off-road technology.Its also available in short and long wheelbases, while the option to remove pretty much every exterior  turns driving the Wrangler into a real occasion - though you may want to keep them attached during winter.Subaru ForesterSubarus presence here in Scotland might not be the largest, but the cars it makes manage to provide a great compromise between good on-road manners and credible off-road characteristics. The Forester is a great example. Its comfortable when youre on the tarmac, but clever all-wheel-drive technology ensures that it can keep moving over tricky surfaces too.Its spacious and practical, while a mild-hybrid powertrain can help to bring fuel use down.Mercedes G-ClassThe latest G-Class loses none of the charm and presence of the original but delivers a high-end driving experience as a bonus. Its interior is well-made and comfortable, while a large central screen helps to give the G-Class a more modern feel.But that doesnt mean its gone soft off-road. Three separately engageable dferential locks show that the G-Class isnt messing about and ensure that it can keep movingonly one wheel has grip.Toyota Land CruiserToyotas famous Land Cruiser is nearly a by-word for off-road reliability and robustness. The latest version is no dferent, bringing a huge amount of go-anywhere technology wrapped in a package that is comfortable and spacious.Much like others here, it can be specied in three- and five-door layouts, ensuring theres a model to fit nearly every requirement."},{"url":null,"title":"comedian-jimmy-carr-hilarious-new-show","story":"Called I Literally Just Told You, the format was created by former Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon and will air on Channel .And comedian Carr,  - whos known for his stand-up and roles on shows like  Out Of  Cats - recalls it \"was the most ludicrous pitch Ive ever heard for a TV show\".Why  Well, the questions hes asking as the host are being written during filming - and theyre about something that has just happened while the show is being made. So, the contestants need to be constantly paying attention to get the answers right.Its a fun show for viewers to join in with from the sofa, but the competitors have the chance to win big money. If they correctly remember the things theyve seen and heard minutes earlier, they can add more cash to their prize pot.Then theres the chaotic finale of each episode, where we see the remaining two contestants setting each other questions.Here we catch up with Londoner Carr, who welcomed a son with partner Karoline Copping in .WHAT MAKES I LITERALLY JUST TOLD YOU STAND OUT AS A GAME SHOW The contestants are crazy good. I dont know where we found these people, but we searched high and low.Its got an enormous play-at-home factor, which most game shows dont have. Most game shows are binary, you either know the answer or you dont - all you have to know for this show is whats just happened. And we had real fun with the fact that anything can happen. You can have -second cameos, you can have  ad breaks, you can mess with peoples minds.IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ENJOYED CATCHING PEOPLE OUT...Yeah, the misdirects are good - its comedic. I think the best bit of the show is the end round. Ive never seen another game show do that, where you go, Oh, youre setting each other questions.We preyed upon the fact that when you come and do a TV show, you dont know whats normal. So we did some very abnormal things. Like, someone from Girls Aloud just walks through the room for no reason at all. Its crazy, but it sort of works, because people just go Well, I guess its telly - who knows The opening is, Anything could be a question and the time starts now. So,I was having a chat with autocue, or the warm-up man, or the guy on the rig doing the lighting, any of that could be a question.HOW GOOD WOULD YOU BE AS A CONTESTANT ON THIS SHOW Im used to being on stage and having to remember someones name from  minutes ago so that I could do a call back to that guy on stage while Im doing the next bit. So, my memory is not bad.If youre a one-liner guy - and Im a one-liner guy - you need to be able to remember  jokes in a row every night, so you work that muscle a lot.WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE TAKING PART IN A CELEBRITY VERSION The dream team for this would be hosts of the other TV shows because I always think when youre the host of a TV show, youve got all the answers, and theres a bit of smugness that comes with that. So, get [Phillip] Schofield who does The Cube, [Jeremy] Clarkson does Who Wants To Be A Millionaire  now - get him. Get Anne Robinson.ITS BEEN A DIFFICULT COUPLE OF YEARS. HOW HAS THE COVID- PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOU PERSONALLY I guess every comedian was given an ultimatum by management you either do a podcast, or you write a book. I think I took the gentlemans choice I wrote a book [called Before  Laughter].And I was a full-time dad in the lockdown. I had a little baby two years ago. I never would have had that expansive time with my child, and I liked it an awful lot.TELL US MORE ABOUT THE BOOK...The book is basically everything I know about le. Its like half biography and half self-help. Theres a weird thing where looking back on your le, you could just believe it was luck. But you make your own luck you lean into what youre best at, you work hard at where you think you might have the most success.The idea of the book is that it would emulate a day with me. I go straight in on serious stuff with friends. So, this book feels like its a fairly good approximation of what itd be like to be my friend. Im very proud of it.HAS THE RISE OF CANCEL CULTURE CHANGED THE WAY YOU APPROACH LIVE COMEDY Cancel culture has always been a thing. I think I have a duty to my audience, that people have booked tickets to see an edgy comic tell edgy jokes, so Im going to do that. Im performing to an audience that has paid to be there, and we have a lot of fun. And its - somewhat ironically, I suppose - a very safe space, a comedy show. It feels like thats where transgressive comedy should live.YOU TURN  NEXT SEPTEMBER. DO YOU HAVE ANY WORRIES ABOUT THAT MILESTONE Ive had a reasonable amount of work done.

The free exhibition, due to open late summer , will explore the legacy of Sir William Burrell as a man and collector and his motivations to establish an internationally renowned museum for the people of Glasgow and beyond.Professor Frances Fowle, Senior Trustee, Sir William Burrell Trust, said: \"We are delighted to acquire this profoundly moving bronze by Camille Claudel for the Burrell Collection. This outstanding artist, although underrepresented in this country, was an important role model for women sculptors at the turn of the twentieth century. The sculpture will perfectly complement the museum’s important holding of works by Auguste Rodin, with whom Claudels career was so closely aligned.”Read more: Glasgows riverside: greatest untapped development opportunity in Western EuropeClaudel became a sculptor at a time when it was very dficult for women to do so. The École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where artists would usually attend to become a sculptor, did not accept women at the time. Undeterred, Claudel studied at the nearby Académie Colarossi.The blossoming artist was introduced to Rodin when she was -years-old. Two years later she began working in his studio. Soon, Claudel and Rodin became involved, and their lives, as well as their work, became inextricably linked.L’Implorante was created around the same time her relationship with Rodin was coming to an end, and he ed to his long-term partner, Rose Beuret. It shows a naked, young woman kneeling on rocky ground, reaching forward with both arms, asattempting to grasp something or holding something invisible. Her face has a child-like expression, her lips are parted asshe is about to say something, and her eyebrows are furrowed, expressing sadness.The kneeling figure was first modelled as part of a larger, three-figure group, L’Âge Mûrin -, which depicts a middle-aged man being led away from the youthful figure shown in L’Implorante. This group sculpture is commonly acknowledged to depict a regretful Rodin being stolen away from the young Claudel by an aged Beuret.The reproduction rights for L’Implorante were acquired from Claudel by the publicist and editor Eugène Blot around . He arranged for the sculpture to be cast in two sizes: cm and .cm. It is believed only five of the larger size were produced, plus around  of the smaller versions. Today four of these are held in the collections of the Musée Rodin in France, Albert-Andre Museum in France, Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Switzerland and the politan Museum of Art in New York.The Burrell Collection’s European bronze sculptures centre around  works by Rodin, a grouping second only in size to the VA in the UK including the well-known and much-loved sculpture The Thinker.When Sir William was actively collecting Claudel would not have been considered an important artist. Although not obvious at the time, he purchased a work with very close connections to Claudel. The Rodin sculpture Brother and Sister borrows directly from a pre-existing work by Camille Claudel. It is sometimes even regarded as a collaboration between the two artists. This will also be on show when the refurbished museum reopens in March .Councillor David McDonald, Chair of Glasgow Le, said: “We are elated to acquire this piece by Camille Claudel and indebted to the Burrell Trustees, National Fund for Acquisitions, Art Fund, Henry Moore Foundation for their support in helping us secure this internationally important sculpture for The Burrell Collection.“Glasgow Le is proud to actively collect work by women artists and announcing acquisitions is a source of huge excitement, especially when it is the first of its kind in the UK. Until now Glasgow did not have a sculpture by Claudel. This piece bolsters the collection and connects well with other works that will be on show, most notably by Rodin.“We are certain it will be a draw for visitors, and it demonstrates the Burrell is not a static collection, but one that embraces change and responds to the world around it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen-pledge-full-support-funso-ojo-following-charge","story":"The alleged incident involves a corporate hospitality guest who gained access to a restricted area of the stadium after the match on November .Aberdeen have pledged their “full support” to the -year-old Belgian.A Dons statement read: “The club is aware of the latest developments regarding an incident involving our player, Funso Ojo, and a corporate hospitality guest who gained unauthorised access to what is designated as a secure and restricted area of Tannadice Park after our match against Dundee United on Saturday November .“Frustratingly, we are not able to provide any further detail on the incident as this is now a matter for the Procurator Fiscal.“The club is, however, offering its full support to Funso, who has fallen victim to circumstances not of his making.”Ojo was sent off in the first half of the same match at Tannadice for a separate incident involving a supporter when the midfielder’s momentum took him into the advertising boards at the front of the Eddie Thompson Stand.A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “A -year-old man has been charged in connection with a minor assault which took place inside Tannadice Park, Dundee, around pm on Saturday November  .“He will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron-uk-records-highest-daily-total-covid-cases-variant-spreads","story":"Official figures showed there had been , new cases recorded as of am on Wednesday.It is the highest figure announced since mass testing began in summer last year and surpasses the previous record of January  when , new cases were reported.Prime Minister Boris Johnson was set to hold a press conference from Downing Street later on Wednesday.READ MORE: Scotland is first UK nation to give booster vaccine dose to half of all adultsEarlier in the day, the mandatory use of coronavirus health certicates to demonstrate vaccination or a negative test for entry into large venues in England was introduced.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency\",\"description\": \"Omicron: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency tells the Commons Transport Committee that Omicron is  \"probably the most signicant threat weve had since the start of the pandemic \"\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media DdpDTmga poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests DdpDTmga.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Compulsory mask-wearing has also been extended and work-from-home guidance was reintroduced under the Government’s Plan B to tackle the pandemic this winter.But Mr Johnson suffered a major blow to his authority that raised questions over his ability to bring in further measures after  Tories rebelled to oppose the measures in a Commons vote.READ MORE: Swinney warns of more restrictions before ChristmasAnalysis suggested Omicron is now the dominant strain in London.The UK Health Security Agencysaid a further , cases of Omicron were recorded, bringing the total of confirmed cases in the UK to ,.But the agency earlier this week estimated that the true number of daily infections from the strain first detected in South Africa is around ,."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far -

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-.

We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

But since then we have picked up more injuries.“They are not Covid-related injuries, but they are because players are picking up injuries because we can’t rotate the team and the squad because of the number of players we already have out.”Leicester’s woes could not come at a worse time, with Sunday’s win against Newcastle marking the start of a hectic fixture schedule which sees them play seven matches in  days.“We will put out the best team that we can. We will assess things game by game,” said the Leicester boss.“If you look at the proximity of the games coming up, it is an incredible run of games and a challenging fixture list at any time when you have a full squad. But with the numbers we have it is extremely challenging. We’ll try to get through it.”The Premier League’s - handbook says matches should go aheada club have  or more players available on their squad list, but decisions can be taken on a game-by-game basis by the Premier League board.The PA news agency understands there is no official threshold for the number of positive cases that would cause a game to be called off.Last week, Tottenham reported eight players and five members of staff had tested positive for coronavirus, leading to their Europa Conference League match against Rennes and Sunday’s Premier League trip to Brighton both being called off.Rodgers said: “It would be nicethere was a bit more clarity around the issue.“Games have been called off with less players than we have unavailable. It’s all a bit disappointing, but we have always tried to respect the competition and again that is what we will do.“There will be opportunities for some of our younger players to be involved and experience the Premier League and that will help their development.”Daniel Amartey will be back in the squad against Tottenham after initially being one of the seven to miss the games against Napoli and Newcastle.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639578428893.jpg--covid_19___wed_15th_december_figures.jpg?1639578428000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211215newscovid 19 wed 15th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Education in Northern Ireland is a contested matter. Our review covers every conceivable educational issue.

A very large part of that time has been taken with trying to acquaint ourselves with the details of the system we are considering.“We have already met with many stakeholders, including political parties and the expert  on underachievement.“We have tried to find out what has worked and what hasn’t and engaged in talking about solutions.“We are now particularly anxious to engage with people professionally engaged in education, parents and carers, children and young people,” he said.“We have launched an online survey last Friday, open until the end of February. There have been  replies so far, a very good start.“But  months is a very limited period of time.“Much discussion will be centred on funding issues. Per pupil, Northern Ireland spends the lowest in the UK, budgetary pressures are well documented, as is the sustainability of the system under such pressures.“The impact on young people will be central.”Dr Bloomer did say from what he had found so far that the belief Northern Ireland does not have a single education system at present is misleading in some respects.“There are a great many things that suggest there is a single education system, one curriculum, one mechanism for assessing performance. There is more unity than appears at first glance, though there is a great deal of iety relating to administration and governance matters.”Asked by Pat Sheehan MLAacademic selection will be paramount in the thoughts of the , Dr Bloomer replied: “Yes.“It is a Northern Ireland specic issue. Academic selection is very high on that list of priorities. We will most certainly be considering it.”Review  vice-chairman Sir Gerry Loughran, a former head of the Civil Service in Northern Ireland, said the  were reviewing an education system which already has obvious signicant problems.“Funding is going to remain a problem going forward,” he said.“The Finance Minister has already said signicant funds will have to be found for the health system and that can only be achieved by other departments taking cuts.“Education was already facing well-documented shortfalls. Further cuts seem to me to be extraordinarily dficult to contemplate.“There may be things we recommend which may cost more money.

I don’t expect a whip-round. It’s not the end of the world.“I never frequented the bar anyway, so it’s not a loss to me.”The Assembly Commission confirmed it had issued guidance to MLAs and that the requirements also applied to events held in the building.Following a Stormont debate yesterday that ided MLAs, the controversial regulations were passed by  votes to , with the DUP voting against.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll abstained.People wishing to access nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises will need to provide proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result or evidence of previous Covid infection. The scheme was introduced late last month with a two-week grace period to allow businesses to adjust to the requirements.South Down MLA Mr Wells said he took multiple Covid tests every week, using both lateral flow and PCR options.“I’m getting my PCR test [today]. I’m probably one of the most tested people in Northern Ireland,” he added yesterday.“If I produce evidence of that, that would entitle me to visit the Members’ Dining Room on Thursday or Friday.“I hadn’t that, so I couldn’t go then. I can’t use any of the catering in the building.“I was told that from December , this would be enforced at Stormont.”Mr Wells is still able to access other parts of the building, including the

rules.“Members and passholders are required by law to comply fully with the regulations and to assist Assembly Commission staff and contractors in their operation,” it added.It also said provisions were already in place for people who can show proof of medical exemption from vaccinations or participation in a clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine.Covid certication rules apply for entry to all large indoor and outdoor events, including concerts and sports.The outcome of yesterday’s debate, which overran from the previous evening, prompted Health Minister Robin Swann to plead for a unied message from the Executive and wider Assembly.“I would ask for those who seek ision over this issue to look to what we can achieve when we pull together rather than looking for further ision,” he said.“We tackle Covid as a united society in Northern Ireland, doing everything that we can and everything that we know works.”He also referred to comments made earlier this week by DUP First Minister Paul Givan, who warned that a “storming is coming” with the expected spread of the Omicron iant across Northern Ireland.“You are better preparing for a storm when it is not raining, rather than waiting until you are up to your knees in water,” Mr Swann told MLAs.“That is what these regulations, as part of a wider package, intend to do.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\"

That becomes a job, but there’s no compensation, and that person is not doing something to bring in revenue — it’s just a cost,” he argued.“That’s a shameful and embarrassing U-turn that reminds me of the grand prix on Sunday, although to arbitrarily change the rules at the last minute there did create something very exciting.”The Department of Health said: “The regulations were amended on Thursday afternoon, and the guidance was uploaded with revised language on Friday morning.“Hospitality sector representatives were briefed on the changes on Friday morning.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSimon Hamilton being congratulated by former DUP leader Peter Robinson on his appointment as Stormont Finance Minister in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSimon Hamilton being congratulated by former DUP leader Peter Robinson on his appointment as Stormont Finance Minister in Traders are also worried about the prospect of further restrictions in the new year.Festive joy is in short supply, Mr Hamilton added.“Usually at this time of year you’re looking to a new year, to turn the page and be full of hope, and I just think a lot of businesses in those customer-facing sectors are coming into  and genuinely not knowing what they’re going to face, and that makes it dficult to plan... confidence is ebbing.“There is a great degree of worry out there. They’re worried, they’re weary and they’re wary about what the future might hold. They’ve been through a heck of a lot and it’s been a roller-coaster ride for them and many of them are finding it very, very dficult.”He says speculation about future restrictions from ministers and advisers can have an immediate impact on the mood in the city centre, leading to cancellations.Mr Hamilton doesn’t refer specically to Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride, who last month said restrictions in “certain environments and sectors” may be considered in the run-up to the festive season.He said: “There’s a lot of what I would consider to be damaging speculation around what may or may not come in.“The Executive must take decisions on the basis of what evidence it has, and it hasn’t been hugely helpful that there’s been a wide amount of speculation about what may be required now or in the future.“That has definitely impacted on trade and has definitely impacted on business confidence, and I don’t think sometimes there’s an appreciation of how weary business owners are and their staff whenever they hear that we may go through another period of restrictions.“It contrasts with the mood coming into the summer and early autumn when there were still dficulties, but there was a sense of optimism.“Unless there is a signicant amount of additional support coming from the Treasury, I don’t think the Executive has the capacity to properly compensate businesses.“This is a very careful balancing act for the Executive to take and I don’t think that they have the freedom to go much further in terms of what they are doing.“It would be grossly unfairthey were to go much furtherwithout compensating business for the inevitable damage to trading it would do.”He says the £m Shop Local scheme has been a welcome boost to the city centre and that the Chamber had championed the idea over a long period.But he acknowledges it has had some flaws, including its continued rollout over Christmas when much retail spending would have been taking place anyway.“I think that’s something we’re always looking for, things to be absolutely bang-on perfect,” he said.“But I think with the scale of the scheme it was always going to pose some dficulties in its implementation, and I do think those dficulties have in the grand scheme been quite small in the overall numbers.”The Chamber doesn’t yet know the level of cancellations of Christmas parties at Belfast venues over the last few weeks since the new Omicron iant was discovered and the prospects of new restrictions were raised.“Any conversation with hospitality, leisure or events tells me that it’s quite painful at the minute. At a time we thought we were moving to a better space, it’s unfortunately very reminiscent of some of the other periods, like this time last year or other times in the pandemic, where we’ve had very dficult conversations with people who are wondering what the heck they’re going to do,” he added.Askedhe regrets being away from the challenges of running a Stormont department during Covid-, he jokes: “Do you watch the news  I do, I read your newspaper and others, and I don’t miss it and I’m glad I am where I am.“I don’t look at anybody who is doing some of the jobs that I used to do and have anything other than a huge degree of admiration for them. I was in dferent challenging posts in dferent periods and there’s always perpetual crisis in Stormont of one kind or another.“It is incredibly dficult to govern in this place and I can only imagine how much more dficult it is to do it at the moment. I look at them and wish them well. I wish them luck or whatever, but I am only glad I am not one of them.”He says ato politics, perhaps even for a dferent party, isn’t on the cards.“It sounds like I’m not closing the door or ruling anything out, but one thing that le has taught me, and I’m old enough now to start making mental notes about lessons, you never rule anything out as you don’t know where le is going to go,” he said.“But that is a phase of my le that I feel is done. To say I thoroughly enjoyed it suggests that I enjoyed every single second, but I really did enjoy that period. It was an immense privilege to serve in those three departments — but I don’t see that as something I would want to do again.”Most ReadLoyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in NewtownardsDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote Ballymena man McClintock admits murder of Jason Lee Martin at party after doctor retracts evidenceF bosses would blush at Stormont Covid rule change, blasts HamiltonTop VideosPlayColum Eastwood says #Prime Ministers actions have eroded public confidence# PlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!Latest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote Avoid last year’s chaos and act now, union tells Education Minister McIlveen over Omicron fearsCancellations and drop in trade leading to a ‘catastrophic impact# on hospitality sector, warns industry chiefLatestNI cannot be left waiting for Covid- financial support – Michelle O’NeillNI people will not support collapse of Stormont, Lewis saysBoris Johnson: Russian war with Ukraine would be ‘catastrophic for the world’Lotto jackpot could be claimed with five numbers rather than six, boss saysTwo men guilty over church collapse that killed scaffolder,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The top ten included Belfast in third, followed by Salford, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh, Bangor, London, Brighton and Hove and Glasgow, respectively. Speaking of the statistics, SDLP councillor Brian Tierney said: The generosity of the Derrypeople has no limits. “I’m proud of our city anditspeople and long may that generosity continue. I’m constantly blown away by the capacity of people in Derry to come together and help people when needed. It’s one of the things that defines us and anyone who visits Derry knows just what a warm and welcoming place it is. In the report, Ireland was voted the most generous country in the world, per capita, for the third year in a row. The UK was named the fourth most generous country after the USA and Canada in second and third. One donation was made every second across the site to help people across the globe.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Bookings will open December  as the large centre opens due to growing concerns over the Omricon iant. You can still receive vaccinations from your GP and local pharmacists. People will be encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Visit the Western Trustwebsite as of December  for updates on booking info:westerntrust.hscni.net western-trust-covid--information-updates covid--vaccination-programme  Alternatively you can book at a local participating chemist or pharmacy for first, second or booster vaccines. The Western Trust has issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. The Trust stated in a post: “The Chief Medical Officers have agreed that the COVID- Booster Programme should be accelerated to help deal with the Omicron Variant. We are therefore once again asking for your help and are calling all those staff who previously worked in our vaccination programme back to assist over the next three weeks. This includes Vaccinators, Administrators and Support Services staff. Our Chief Executive and Corporate Management Team have agreed that staff will be released back to support the vaccine programme, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We appreciate how important leave is and we will try to protect any leave already booked, but would appreciate any flexibility that staff may be able to give. The announcement comes as SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney, encouraged people across Derry to get their Covid- booster vaccine. Councillor Tierney said: “I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get their Covid- booster vaccine as soon as possible to protect themselves and those around them. With the renewed threat the Omicron iant is posing to our society, we need to do everything we can to increase our defences to the virus. I would also urge anyone yet to receive their first and second doses to take this opportunity to get vaccinated. “There will be a number of places throughout the Western Trust area where people can get their booster vaccine, including the Foyle Arena and Omagh Leisure Complex from Wednesday. Booster vaccinations can also be provided by your GP and local community pharmacy. People are being encouraged to book their appointment from Wednesday, but limited walk-ins will also be available. “Following the current Covid- guidelines, including getting vaccinated, using Covid certication, practising social distancing and washing our hands is the most effective way of keeping each other safe and preventing the need for further restrictions.

Paacutedraig Delargy said: “We need to see major investment to improve rails services and connections in the North West of this island. “Linking up all rail services on an all-island basis presents huge opportunities to grow the economy and create jobs, particularly along the Western Corridor linking Derry to Sligo and Galway and delivering a faster train service to the capital in Dublin. “This would help unlock Derry’s potential, promote regional equality and connect us to the rest of this island with major benefits for workers and commuters. “Alongside this, delivering first-class public transport and investing in our rail lines can help tackle the climate emergency and reduce carbon emissions. That should be the focus of transport ministers, North and South. I would encourage people to take part in the consultation. The deadline to take part in this consultation is Friday, January .

Ryan, who moved to Strabane from Derry with his parents when he was three weeks old, always liked drawing as a child butwouldntsay that it was his main hobby, “Im sure the others that were in my in class at school would say that I was decent at art but I would not have stood out as someone with a particular talent,” he said. “Drawing was my thing. Painting was something I completely avoided - I had no confidence in it. Nowadays,itsbecome the only medium I work in. I love it. “I think Ideveloped my painting through the little bits and pieces I was doing with my students from day to day. The first proper piece I did was the portrait of Seamus Heaney. That was around six years ago. Since then, painting has become a real passion for me.” Ryan’s we, Roisin,has always pushed him to share his work on social media. Over the first lockdown, Ryan finally gave in. He said: “I was so nervous putting the first piece up but I was completely overwhelmed by the response I received. “Most people who knew me wouldn’t have known that I painted in my spare time, soI think people were surprised to start with. “People started asking me to do prints of the portraits of Jack Charlton, John Hume and Samuel Beckett, and so I did. “Then others would ask me to do paintings for them and that has grown into what I do today.” Ryan’s love for portraiture began when, ata young age, he saw Van Gogh’s ‘Postman, JosephRoulin.’ The -year-olds love of portraits snowballed from then on and now it is what he enjoys painting the most, with a particular love for painting people of interest from the island. “In my work, I am normally trying to promote a shared view of our community – portraying people we should all be able to celebrate regardless of background,” he said. “When painting someone’s portrait I need to feel that the image captures something of that persons personality as I see it. “Recently, I have been commissioned to do a few landscapes which I have also enjoyed but the portraits seem to come more naturally to me. “I would say producing art has only really become a career goal in the last - months. I never would have thought that anyone would have been interested in having my work on their wall and I amreally gratefulto everyone who has invested in it. “I do think it will always be something I will do on the side though. I enjoy working with the students in school and I think I’d find it dficult to leave that behind.” Ryan’s most recent commission- to paint the late John Hume for a customer in Spain- was a special moment for him, “I was over the moon to have been asked to work on this specic piece.  “Itsthe second timeIvepainted him. I came across this image a while back and I was eager to paint it as soon as I saw it. “I was delighted when my client chose this as the image she wanted. John Hume was a true great. What he did for the people of Derry is immeasurable and he is loved across our community. “I recently passed a few prints of this piece to some of the Hume family. It isvery rewardingto know that theyhave gotmy paintings of him in their homes and that makes it all very worthwhile to me.” Ryan is currently loving the balance between producing his art and working as an art teacher.Theex StColumb’s student has a young family and is extremely busy between work and home. He added: “At the minute I am absolutely loving it. I am reluctant to take on too much as I would never want my art to become a burden. I am in a lovely position in not having to rely on it - I can let it evolve organically.” To keep up to date with Ryan’s work you can follow his Facebook page: Ryan Coyle Fine Art’ or his Instagram: ryancoylefineart’ Ryan can be contacted on either of these two s or atryancoyleart@outlook  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Ryan, who moved to Strabane from Derry with his parents when he was three weeks old, always liked drawing as a child butwouldntsay that it was his main hobby, “Im sure the others that were in my in class at school would say that I was decent at art but I would not have stood out as someone with a particular talent,” he said. “Drawing was my thing. Painting was something I completely avoided - I had no confidence in it. Nowadays,itsbecome the only medium I work in. I love it. “I think Ideveloped my painting through the little bits and pieces I was doing with my students from day to day. The first proper piece I did was the portrait of Seamus Heaney. That was around six years ago. Since then, painting has become a real passion for me.” Ryan’s we, Roisin,has always pushed him to share his work on social media. Over the first lockdown, Ryan finally gave in. He said: “I was so nervous putting the first piece up but I was completely overwhelmed by the response I received. “Most people who knew me wouldn’t have known that I painted in my spare time, soI think people were surprised to start with. “People started asking me to do prints of the portraits of Jack Charlton, John Hume and Samuel Beckett, and so I did. “Then others would ask me to do paintings for them and that has grown into what I do today.” Ryan’s love for portraiture began when, ata young age, he saw Van Gogh’s ‘Postman, JosephRoulin.’ The -year-olds love of portraits snowballed from then on and now it is what he enjoys painting the most, with a particular love for painting people of interest from the island. “In my work, I am normally trying to promote a shared view of our community – portraying people we should all be able to celebrate regardless of background,” he said. “When painting someone’s portrait I need to feel that the image captures something of that persons personality as I see it. “Recently, I have been commissioned to do a few landscapes which I have also enjoyed but the portraits seem to come more naturally to me. “I would say producing art has only really become a career goal in the last - months.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The SDLP published their energy costs action plan last week and Mr Durkan called for a payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. The payment would help families top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks so that they would be able to heat their homes over the winter without worrying about how to pay for it. Mr Durkan said: “Given the steep rise in energy bills over the last few months there are families across the North struggling to heat their homes this winter. “In the absence of any action from the Joint First Ministers or Minister Hargey to mitigate the situation the SDLP has produced a number of proposals in our energy costs action plan to try and help people through this very dficult period. “While energy bills are increasing by hundreds of pounds a year, Universal Credit claimants, who are already struggling to get by, have seen their payments cruelly cut by pound a week by the Tory government and waved through by Sinn Feacutein. “These people were barely able to cover their bills before the recent price hikes and I cannot see how they will able to meet these massive costs. “In an attempt to help the people who really need it I’m calling for the winter fuel payment, a modest payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. “This money will allow families to top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks to get them through this winter, then we can focus on tackling the long-term issues around fuel poverty. “I’m also calling on the Department for Communities to work with the Department for Health to explore how families with children with disabilities can be supported to cope with rising energy costs. “It’s disgraceful that we are already in the grip of winter and no plan has been forthcoming to help low income families deal with these mounting issues. “I will continue lobbying Minister Hargey and doing all I can to secure immediate support for the people who need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Council has been working closely with the business community throughout the pandemic, delivering a range of support from bespoke advice to essential grant aid. Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Harkin said the city of Derry should be proud of the workers for standing firm and stated that industrial action could easily have been avoided by the two employers. And Cllr Harkin expressed his hopes that both employers can learn from this dispute and move on and not to victimise employees who are UNITE trade union members for the action they were forced to take. He said: “We commend Derry dockers for staying strong and winning their demands following strike action. They should be proud of what they achieved. Everyone in the city should be proud of the dockers victory. “By staying united and braving freezing weather on the picket line, UNITE members at Burke Shipping Services and Foyle Port made gains on pay parity and a wage increase. “This was a strike that should never have been necessary. The demands made by workers were very modest but employer intransigence gave them no option but to take action. “The attempt to portray workers negatively by employers raises serious questions about public accountability when Council support is sought to become a Free Port. “It also raises questions about Derry City and Strabane Councillors having paid positions as part of the Foyle Port Commission. “People Before Profit activists were on the picket line everyday of the strike and we successfully put forward a motion winning the Council to take a clear-cut position in support of the strike and trade union demands. “We will be demanding the Council make clear there should be no victimisation of workers and the trade union following the end of the dispute. “Dockers and other workers have been told throughout the pandemic that they play a critical role as key, frontline and essential workers. “Trade unions are now demanding this is translated into improved wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. “That employers and the Stormont Executive arent automatically backing these demands points up the problem of an economy catering to elites where the gap between the least well-off and those at the top has skyrocketed. “Workers across Derry, across the North and across Ireland should take confidence and example from the resilience of Foyle Port dockers. “This is what will need to happenwe are to ensure health workers, Council workers, Education support workers and all others begin to be treated with dignity, respect and more economic equality. “No one should be told they should wait for better days - this is the time to use solidarity and action to challenge poverty pay.” UNITE General Secretary, Sharon Graham, added: “This is a tremendous win for our members. “Having endured freezing cold and driving rain on long days on picket lines, the workers stood ready to escalate their strike action but their determination led to both employers making offers which met their demands in full. “This is a good news story for workers everywhere in Northern Ireland and shows that there is a power in our union. “It confirms yet again that when our members fight in unity for their jobs, pay and conditions they can win.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis.

He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money. The boat is excellent, but we tried to lighten it as much as possible in order to make easier. Even so, we are putting in enough food and water to last a minimum of  days, plus our clothes and sleeping gear.The boat will also carry navigation and safety equipment, plus satellite phones to keep in touch with their loved ones and other competitors.During the voyage, three crew members will be rowing at any time, while the other two are resting, and safety harnesses will be worn at all times.ldquoWersquove trained hard and prepared well and I know that racing two kilometres in a skf race bears no comparison with what lies ahead, but wersquore all looking forward to the race, Clive added.Clive and his team-mates are hoping to raise pound, for the Reverse Rett charity, which supports children with Rett Syndrome, a neurological degenerative disease.Anyone wishing to make a donation is asked to go to visit https:www.justgiving fundraising ross-mckinney.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 12%2C 2001  ","story":"SAINTFIELD ndash Saintfield is in line for a new multi-million pound hotel development which is set to create up to  jobs.

team ahead again with a try and Matthew Nortonrsquos third conversion of the day meant that Dromore had to find another try to regain the lead.As the game headed into the closing minutes the visitors managed to cross the Hinch line and looked set to claim a famous victory as they lead - going into injury time.However, indiscipline was to cost them as they gave away a penalty at the death.Ballynahinch spurned the chance of a draw and kicked for the corner to go for glory and Conor Phillips delivered the winning score in the opposite corner to win a great match.The quarter-finals

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances. However, the Magpies led by four on referee Niall Cullenrsquos short whistle.Ramor came out after the break and pressed high, and were rewarded with three scores in the first five minutes.Kilcoo didnrsquot panic and upped the ante immediately with two Paul Devlin frees settling things. Jerome Johnston and Eugene Branagan kept the scoreboard ticking and on the th minute the brilliant Ceilum Doherty found the net after great approach play by Dylan Ward.From here to the end, Kilcoo kept playing with that high tempo and the game was put beyond the Virginia men with six minutes remaining when man of the match Jerome Johnston found the net once again.Both sides emptied their benches as the game petered out, as the Down men came away with an impressive win.Mickey Moran and his management team will take great heart from many aspects of their teamrsquos performance and will know only too well it will take this and morethey are to win against the Derry champions and reach back-to-back Ulster finals.Kilcoo assistant manager Conleith Gilligan expressed mixed emotions as the local side look ahead to the semi-final stage.ldquoThere was definitely some nice passages of play and, look, we were able to play the game at our own pace and as the competition goes on that wonrsquot be allowed to happen, he said.ldquoOnce we got our legs moving, up to the first water-break we did very well.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

I’m looking for opportunities to boost trade in key areas such as digital, services and agriculture, as well as discussing ways our world-class professionals, such as engineers or lawyers, can offer their services more easily in the US.Starting in Calornia, my journey takes in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Oklahoma, with a pitstop in Belfast’s twin city, Nashville, to take in some of Tennessee’s famous country music.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Among the firms to have capitalised is Ulster Carpets, which has offices in America and sees the US market as pivotal to its international strategy. Of course, it’s not just goods that Northern Ireland is successfully selling to the US.Thanks to the global reach of shows like HBO’s smash hit Game of Thrones, Northern Ireland’s production landscape has enjoyed a huge boost. Paper Owl Films, based in Hollywood, says the show raised the profile of the entire Northern Ireland creative industries sector for film and TV.SixteenSouth is further testament to this the Belfast-based BAFTA-winning animation studio with over  international accolades has attracted global stars to voice characters in its shows, including Tennessee’s very own Dolly Parton.So, whilst transatlantic trade remains strong, there is always more we can do. That’s why we recently launched our ‘Made in the UK, Sold to the World’ plan to help businesses across Northern Ireland unleash their export potential and start selling their world-class products to the US and beyond.No matter what stage of their export journey they are at, businesses can access government support via the Export Support Service, a one-stop shop for exporting advice.As part of this, we’ve also launched a new UK Tradeshow Programme to help businesses across all parts of the UK attend more events and tradeshows to promote their products around the world.With the expansion of DIT’s Export Academy to SMEs in Northern Ireland and the launch of Trade and Investment Northern Ireland, there’s never been a better time for businesses in Northern Ireland to start exporting. In fact, research shows that companies that export their goods are % more productive than those that don’t. The International Trade Secretary was in Northern Ireland last month, hosting the Board of Trade in Derry Londonderry and encouraging businesses right across the region to take advantage of the support on offer. As we continue to break down more trade barriers, cut red tape and make it easier for UK companies to trade abroad, I can’t wait to see more businesses capitalising on the enormous opportunities that the US has to offer.– Penny Mordaunt is UK Minister for Trade PolicyFor more opinion on everything from Gerry Adams to the national anthem, visit this link: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

We know that it is signicantly more transmissible, probably around two and a half times more transmissible than the Delta form of the virus.“If we look at what is happening where in the UK and internationally, we see that once Omicron becomes established, it spreads remarkably quickly.“The doubling time for cases is around two days in England and Scotland, and it is inevitable that we are going to see the same thing in Northern Ireland.“As a result of that, we will see increasing numbers of the Omicron virus and they are likely to increase very rapidly.“It is probably going to become the dominant form of the virus, certainly before the end of this year and possibly earlier than that.”He added: “There is an expectation in UK-terms of very large numbers potentially of Omicron cases, numbers much higher than we have seen at any previous stage of the epidemic.“And that would also be the case in Northern Ireland.“The key question is the steps to which those very large numbers would translate through into hospital admissions.“There is a sense that very large numbers of cases, while disruptive to society and dficult for iniduals can be managed.“It is the number of people who will require admission to hospital which will be the critical factor.“If Omicron were to be similar to Delta, then it would be signicantly worse than that, possibly even several times worse, without further measures.”It comes as deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that Northern Ireland cannot be held to ransom over Covid- financial support and be left waiting for decisions to be taken in England.Ms O’Neill said: “Of course we are looking at our own resources but I am asking the Treasury to stand up the furlough scheme again today, that needs to be done so,we need to reach for it, it’s there and available to us.”DUP First Minister Paul Givan said engagement with the Treasury was ongoing to establish what additional financial support was on offer.He said the Executive may also have to ert some more of its own resources to tackle Omicron through the next in-year reallocation exercise, which is due in January.Meanwhile, four further patients who had previously tested positive for Covid- have died in Northern Ireland.Another , cases of the virus were also reported by the Department of Health on Wednesday.On Wednesday morning there were  Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom  were in intensive care.More from this reporter:Click here: Covid keyboard theorists should knock of the Nazi comparisons says MLA Click here: Kne-edge Irish unity survey from Tory peer stands in contrast to much more pro-Union pollsClick here: Bill to bar abortions of disabled foetuses up to birth voted down at Stormont——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Why not name it after yourself, your business, or a loved one \"Oryou really want, you can call our stadium The my mate Dave is a k**b Arena - knock yourself out!\"The lucky competition winner was named as Katie Louise Williams - the girlfriend of the clubs star striker Thomas Walters.Beautician Katie decided to rename Frampton Lane after her pet dog Moomin and chose the title Prince Moomins Palace.Ms Williams, , is planning to take four-year-old Moomin down to the next match to show him around his own stadium.She said: \"Im sure he will be very excited. We cant wait to take him.\"Ive been following the team for years and it was great to win the prize. Moomins name will be known to everyone around her now.\"The club confirmed Ms Williams - who is also the long-term partner of star striker Thomas Walters - won the prize.The club said: \"The stadium was named after her dog Moomin, who we are reliably informed is treated like a Prince.\"The competition raised vital funds in the quest for the club achieving a FAW Tier  License, with proceeds raised going towards much needed ground improvements such as floodlights.\"Reaction from fans has been positive, although much confusion on the stands last Saturday as to whether were still the Windmill Army or now the Moomin Army.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With the spread of Omicron has come new restrictions in England – one Wednesday, Boris Johnson announced the UK government would switch to its winter Plan B.Because health is devolved, that move has no direct impact on Wales – and in any case the new rules for England, such as Covid Passes for some events and venues, and the recommendation to work from home, have already been in place in Wales for months.But Ms Morgan will be meeting with first minister Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers today for the latest three-week review of the Covid rules. The results of that meeting, and any rule changes in Wales, will likely be confirmed this evening or on Friday.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:In the meantime, the service in Welsh NHS-run Covid testing laboratories will be increased to seven days a week in a bid to track the spread of Omicron.The health minister called the emergence of the new strain \"a sombre reminder that the pandemic is not yet over\".\"There is concern that the Omicron iant may be spread much faster than other iants,\" Ms Morgan added. \"It’s important we try to delay the spread of Omicron in Wales, and to do so we need to rapidly identy cases..remove\"Throughout the pandemic testing has played a crucial role and we want to swtly identy Omicron cases here in Wales.\"This alongside other measures already in place will help us once again to keep Wales safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySpeaking on BBC Radio Wales this morning, Dr Frank Atherton said: “It is the worst time of year to be considering this, but I think we just have to look at population mixing.“It is almost inevitable that we may have to consider what measures to reduce population mixing are needed at this point in time but that is for ministers to discuss and I will be providing advice on that.”Dr Atherton spoke after he and the other three chief medical officers in the UK agreed to raise the UK Covid alert level yesterday to level four. This does not change the current restrictions in place in Wales, which currently remains at alert level zero.Dr Atherton also said that the initial peak of the omicron iant was predicted to be around January or February - but rates are rising quicker than expected.“When I first heard about omicron, I thought it would be a problem in January and February. With these transmission rates we are far more likely to see a problem running into the Christmas period and then into early January. So that is why we felt the need to raise the alert level,” he said.He also highlighted things that people in Wales can do to help minimise the spread.He said: “It is unpalatable at this time of year to say this, but we need to think about contacts we are having because we know that this virus loves to transmit from person to person and we cannot afford to have large gatherings at this time of year because it will bring community transmission that we are fearful of.”He also highlighted the importance of the boosters and having the booster when people are called for. “We are seeing quite signicant numbers of people have been contacting the NHS to say they have got an appointment for their booster but are going to delay it and asking for another appointment,” he said..removeMORE NEWS:“That implies people aren’t prioritising it and that is natural when it is Christmas time and people are thinking about other things.\"What we are now saying is you cannot think about anything more important than getting your booster because we know that the vaccine effectiveness is reduced a bit but the protection with booster shots against serious harm is still about  per cent and so the best thing, we can do for ourselves, and our loved ones is to get your booster shots when you are eligible.”Dr Atherton explained that, although the Welsh Government had set a target of offering everyone in Wales aged  and over a booster jab by the end of January, they are working through to bring this forward. He said how there has been work over the weekend to increase this rollout and this could include walk-in clinics, extra vaccination clinics and more volunteers to allow for more vaccines to be administered quicker.He also advised that the rollout will prioritise the elderly and vulnerable first and that everyone over  should have received their invitation for a booster shot. Those who have not should contact their health board. Everyone  over the age of  should wait until they are contacted.He also confirmed that those who are housebound will be able to receive their boosters and that GPs have been given more money to prioritise these. Anyone over  who has not received and invite should contact the relevant health board.Dr Atherton said that, although there are only  cases of the omicron iant in Wales, he expects community transmission is on the rise as seen across the UK and in other nations. It was confirmed this morning by health minister Eluned Morgan that one person in Wales was in hospital with the omicron iant.Dr Atherton said: “It is inevitable as community transmission rises, two weeks later there will be a rise in people needing hospital treatment and needing oxygen and ITU treatment. And two weeks later sadly, a rise in deaths.”He added that decisions around introducing more restrictions were up to the ministers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAndrew RT Davies, Senedd Member for South Wales Central, is supporting the campaign to save Bute Cottage Nursery School.The Vale of Glamorgan Council plans to merge the nursery with Evenlode Primary School – which leads campaigners to believe that the site, which has extensive outdoor areas with many teaching and learning provisions including a chicken coop, summer house, sand pit, pirate ship and another outdoor house, could close for good.Campaigners – more than , have signed a petition against the merger – also feel that the nursery will lose its name, identity and independent governance. Currently with the independent governance, children lead their own learning with support from their experienced nursery teachers.The plans would change the lowest age of pupils at Evenlode from four years old to three, and would add  part-time nursery places to the primary school. Bute Cottage would be discontinued, and staff and pupils would transfer to the primary school by September next year.Laura Windeatt, who launched the petition, said: “This proposal is the start of a slippery slope, starting with Bute Cottage losing its name and identity and ending with its closure and the loss of an environment we should all be determined to preserve.“The loss of Bute Cottage would be signicant to the Vale’s community and felt deeply by the generations of ‘Buties’ across the years, not to mention the future generations who would miss out on such an enriching and inspiring start to their education.“On paper, a single site may at first glance seem practical, especially at such a good, reputable school as Evenlode, but those who know Bute Cottage know that losing it would be a travesty. Bute Cottage is a gem in the heart of the Vale of Glamorgan — one that we should vehemently protect.”MORE NEWS:Mr Davies said: “I do not want to see the merging of Bute Cottage and Evenlode but,that were to happen, it would be even more devastating to see the Bute Lane site close.“It’s important that the Vale Council puts this issue to bed and categorically rules out closing the Bute Lane site of the Bute Cottage Nursery. The facilities at Bute Lane are superb, and perfectly facilitate the pupil-led learning that is implemented at Bute Cottage.“The staff and governors at Bute Cottage have developed a unique identity and learning experience for their pupils.“Their pupil-led learning philosophy is something that should be protected and not lost in a merger with another school with dferent values.The Vale of Glamorgan Council is currently working on going through the consultation responses ready for the full cabinet to make a decision.https:www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-bute-cottage-nursery-schoolGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Western Gateway is billed as a counterpoint to the Northern Powerhouse, attracting major government funding for huge region-wide infrastructure schemes.Including Cardf, Swansea, Newport, Bristol, Bath and Swindon, the Western Gateway group has now set out its priorities for next year.These include tidal energy—which could mean a barrage built across the Severn estuary—as well as enhancing the Great Western mainline railway, and boosting the regional economy.Cardf council leader Huw Thomas sits on the board of the Western Gateway and is its political lead on tidal energy. He said tidal energy in the Severn estuary could provide as much as seven per cent of the total energy needed across the UK.He said: “The UK government has so far refused to support a scheme due to a perceived requirement for high levels of public investment and concerns over the environmental impact on designated areas in the Severn estuary.“However, the changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as signicant. We want to find out what could be done to harness this incredible energy resource.”In October the group revealed it was setting up a new commission to explore building a barrage across the estuary, as well as exploring other options for tidal energy. A barrage had previously been looked at in depth about a decade ago but ultimately dropped as it was seen as too expensive and harmful to the environment.Regional groups such as the Western Gateway, and the more established Northern Powerhouse, are considered key in attracting huge levels of investment needed for major infrastructure projects, like improving the railways, as well as foreign direct investment..removeSpending per person on infrastructure construction is about  per cent higher in the Northern Powerhouse than across the Western Gateway region, Cllr Thomas said, without including the benefits from HS.He added: “HS represents a signicant improvement in connectivity across other parts of the country, putting the Western Gateway at risk of becoming worse off. South Wales and the west of England have not enjoyed the levels of rail enhancement investment experienced where in the UK over the past  years.“This underinvestment has led to relatively less attractive services, attracting fewer passengers, and leading to higher subsidies compared to the rest of the UK.“HS will put Cardf and south Wales at a signicant disadvantage. While the UK economy is predicted to receive a £ billion benefit from HS, south Wales’s GDP will lose an estimated £ million per year. There are similar negative impacts for the southwest of England, with Bristol losing £ million per year, and Gloucester, Bath and northeast Somerset another £ million annually.”To counter this, the Western Gateway is seeking investment for a range of railway upgrades. These include upgrading the South Wales Mainline and Great Western Mainline, running from Swansea through Cardf, Bristol and eventually leading to Heathrow and London. This could mean faster speeds, new stations, and full electrication.Other rail upgrades include improved links between Cardf Central and Bristol Temple Meads, with express and local commuter services, potentially with four services an hour between the two stations. Another upgrade would be to improve the links between Cardf and Birmingham via Gloucester, connecting to the HS network.Cllr Thomas said improving connectivity was “vital” in meeting climate goals and boosting the regional economy, by decarbonising transport and making jobs available to people living in rural areas.Katherine Bennett, who chairs the Western Gateway, said: “This is an exciting time for the Western Gateway. We believe that our area could become the UK’s first green energy supercluster and are working on a programme of work to integrate our strengths and assets across nuclear, hydrogen and tidal to create new opportunities for local communities at risk of being left behind.“We are looking forward to setting out plans for the powerhouse partnership next month at our first conference, Green Growth in the Western Gateway, where leaders from business, research and the public sector from both sides of the Severn will help shape how these plans are brought to le.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We want to find out what could be done to harness this incredible energy resource.”In October the group revealed it was setting up a new commission to explore building a barrage across the estuary, as well as exploring other options for tidal energy. A barrage had previously been looked at in depth about a decade ago but ultimately dropped as it was seen as too expensive and harmful to the environment.Regional groups such as the Western Gateway, and the more established Northern Powerhouse, are considered key in attracting huge levels of investment needed for major infrastructure projects, like improving the railways, as well as foreign direct investment..removeSpending per person on infrastructure construction is about  per cent higher in the Northern Powerhouse than across the Western Gateway region, Cllr Thomas said, without including the benefits from HS.He added: “HS represents a signicant improvement in connectivity across other parts of the country, putting the Western Gateway at risk of becoming worse off. South Wales and the west of England have not enjoyed the levels of rail enhancement investment experienced where in the UK over the past  years.“This underinvestment has led to relatively less attractive services, attracting fewer passengers, and leading to higher subsidies compared to the rest of the UK.“HS will put Cardf and south Wales at a signicant disadvantage. While the UK economy is predicted to receive a £ billion benefit from HS, south Wales’s GDP will lose an estimated £ million per year. There are similar negative impacts for the southwest of England, with Bristol losing £ million per year, and Gloucester, Bath and northeast Somerset another £ million annually.”To counter this, the Western Gateway is seeking investment for a range of railway upgrades. These include upgrading the South Wales Mainline and Great Western Mainline, running from Swansea through Cardf, Bristol and eventually leading to Heathrow and London. This could mean faster speeds, new stations, and full electrication.Other rail upgrades include improved links between Cardf Central and Bristol Temple Meads, with express and local commuter services, potentially with four services an hour between the two stations. Another upgrade would be to improve the links between Cardf and Birmingham via Gloucester, connecting to the HS network.Cllr Thomas said improving connectivity was “vital” in meeting climate goals and boosting the regional economy, by decarbonising transport and making jobs available to people living in rural areas.Katherine Bennett, who chairs the Western Gateway, said: “This is an exciting time for the Western Gateway. We believe that our area could become the UK’s first green energy supercluster and are working on a programme of work to integrate our strengths and assets across nuclear, hydrogen and tidal to create new opportunities for local communities at risk of being left behind.“We are looking forward to setting out plans for the powerhouse partnership next month at our first conference, Green Growth in the Western Gateway, where leaders from business, research and the public sector from both sides of the Severn will help shape how these plans are brought to le.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The event was unable to be staged last year due to the Covid- pandemic, but the veterans still raised £ in memory of their friend.This year, another £ was raised through the pool event. This money was recently donated to the Hospice along with toys for the children receiving care at the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.The ex-soldiers are already planning to raise funds for the charity throughout the year and are hoping to stage the pool competition as part of the effort.My Hayes’ loved ones wish to thank everyone who supported the fundraising event.----Read More Read MoreRecognition for NRC lecturers  \"       \"  ]]Most Popular‘Someone  is going to die’ says victim of latest attack ...NewsPermanent memorial to highlight Carrick family’s remarkable ...NewsWell known scout leader Sammy Malcolm passes away...NewsPortadown killer Garfield Beattie has jail sentence, for sen...NewsJoiner was locked out of house by accident...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"welcome to ni world a new website built on decades of great weekly newspaper journalism ","story":"Hammer attack: extensive damage caused to cars in Cookstown   Portadown killer Garfield Beattie has jail sentence, for sending victim a threatening letter, extended on appealNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleWelcome to NI World - a new website built on decades of great weekly newspaper journalismToday sees a new era for our titles with the launch of a new website that brings you all the great content from our local journalists with some great new features.By Valerie Martin, NI World EditorThursday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  Welcome to NI World As well as local news, views and issues about the towns and villages that matter to you, we will also be bringing you issues and information from across the region we all call home.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
