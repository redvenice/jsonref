A woman walks past an English Heritage blue plague for Bob Marley. The plaque was unveiled by Rastafarian writer and poet Benjamin Zephaniah and introduced by historian and broadcaster David Olusoga         Artist Keith Baugh shows old photographs of Bob Marley at the unveiling of an English Heritage blue plague for the singer, at his former home in Chelsea         Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, eventually spending two years in England and completing Exodus as well as follow-up album Kaya (pictured at the Hammersmith Odeon, London in 1977)Zephaniah, said: \u0027It\u0027s very difficult to say what Bob Marley would have said about this plaque, but he did once say, Live for yourself, you will live in vain, live for others, and you will live again, so I\u0027m quite sure he would say that this is for his people and his music.\u0027Blue plaques commemorate the link between a location and an inidual who was regarded as \u0027eminent\u0027 in their field.Their achievements should have made an \u0027exceptional impact in terms of public recognition\u0027, and they must have been dead for at least 20 years.Other musicians to have received the honour include John Lennon, Freddie Mercury and Mozart. During his time at the house, Marley and his bandmates often played football at the pitches in nearby Battersea Park. Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, eventually spending two years in England and completing Exodus as well as follow-up album Kaya.Exodus stayed on the album charts in the UK for 56 weeks in a row, spawning the hit singles Exodus, Waiting in Vain, Jamming and One Love.The Jamaican icon was also arrested during his stay in London and convicted for possessing a small quantity of cannabis.            Installed on buildings around London by English Heritage, the blue plaques celebrate the link between famous and influential figures and the places where they lived or worked in London. Pictured, some of those receiving the plaques this yearMarley performed at the Crystal Palace Bowl on June 7, 1980 while gravely ill. It would prove to be his last appearance in the UK, with the legendary musician dying less then a year later.   The cultural icon already has two blue plaques in London, including at a house he stayed at in Neasden, north west London, and Flat 34 Ridgmount Gardens in central London, the place where he first stayed in the capital.Mr Olusoga, English Heritage trustee and blue plaques panel member, said: \u0027Bob Marley was the first superstar to emerge from the developing world. More than a brilliant musician, he became a cultural icon who blazed a trail for other black artists.\u0027Traveller and diplomat Gertrude Bell and novelist Angela Carter are among several other famous figures commemorated with blue plaques this year.Mr Olusoga added: \u0027From engineering to music, this year\u0027s blue plaques remind us of the enormous range of human achievement.\u0027All of our blue plaque recipients called London home, at least for a while, and our plaques are a testament to the creativity and variety of this city.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle checks notes make sure speech word perfect","story":"Share this articleTry Meghan\u0026#39s signature style in a trench dress from Banana RepublicThe Duchess of Sussex loves a trench dress.

I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027Wow.I understand why Harry dislikes the press after what happened to his mother, truly I do.Her death must have been incredibly hard for him to take as a 12-year-old boy.But let\u0027s be very clear - the press didn\u0027t kill Diana, a speeding drunk-driver killed Diana.And if she hadn\u0027t recklessly abandoned her usual royal protection officers and drivers, she\u0027d probably still be alive today.         Prince Harry, and Meghan pose with their newborn son Archie on May 8 this year. The Duke of Sussex accused the press of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027relentless propaganda\u0027Yes, she was the subject of huge press attention, but speaking from personal experience as a newspaper editor at the time, I can assure you she played the media game just as ruthlessly as we played it with her.She was the biggest star in the world, and would happily and regularly collude with the papers when it suited her – just as Meghan happily and regularly colludes with magazines like People and Vogue when it suits her.But with all due respect to Ms Markle, she\u0027s not in the same league as Diana in terms of fame.So for Harry to compare them in this way is both wrong and slightly distasteful. (And before the inevitable howls of \u0027you\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s like to lose a parent young\u0027 pour in, let me just point out that my father died when I was very young.)         Meghan was guest editor of September\u0027s Vogue, dedicating it to 15 \u0027fearless women,\u0027 including Jane Fonda, Jacinda Ardern and Greta ThunbergHe added that he has been \u0027witness to her private suffering for too long\u0027 and \u0027to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u0027Hmmm.It was only a few weeks ago that Meghan was telling people at a function that she never reads any press about herself. So how would she know what the press is saying, let alone suffer from it?As I\u0027ve often said, I have little time for Meghan after she ghosted me as a friend the moment she first met Harry. It signified a worrying social-climbing character trait that has seen her ditch many friends and almost all her family if she feels they may threaten her ferociously ambitious rise up the celebrity ladder.But what I think of her personally is irrelevant to the situation that actually sparked this battle with the media, and that is the breakdown of her relationship with her father.There\u0027s no doubt that Thomas Markle made a big mistake in stunting photos with the paparazzi before his daughter\u0027s wedding, as he has admitted himself.But did that really warrant him being banished forever in such a heartless manner?It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that Harry has never met his father-in-law, and that Meghan has now cut him out of her life.         Harry referenced his mother Princess Diana in his statement: \u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027 He is seen above with her and Prince William I\u0027ve interviewed Thomas several times and found him to be a very normal and nice, if naïve, guy who just had no idea how to handle the massive vicarious fame that instantly came his way after Meghan announced she was engaged to a British Prince.Rather then help him, they savagely punished him for a silly mistake, and his erratic behaviour ever since suggests a father deeply hurt and bemused by losing any contact with the daughter he brought up with such love and care.Thomas Markle gave Meghan\u0027s letter to the Mail on Sunday because he wanted to correct what he believed was misleading criticism of him in People magazine from Meghan\u0027s friends.Judge him all you like for it, but imagine how tough the past few years have been for him too? He has never even met his own grandchild.Thomas has been no angel in this family wrangle, but nor is he the devil.And he should be allowed the freedom of speech to defend himself.Rather than going to war with the press in this absurd manner, Harry should clamber down off his hysterical hothead high horse and repair the real running sore causing Meghan\u0027s distress – by making peace with her father. "},{"url":null,"title":"Filthy house covered rubbish faeces starving cats resorted cannibalism survive","story":"Share this article          It is thought up to 10 cats had been left so hungry they resorted to eating the bodies of their companions to survive         Beales and High, who now live in Barrow-in-Furness, avoided jail after admitting two animal welfare offences at Liverpool Magistrates\u0027 CourtBeales and High had reportedly moved out in the days prior, and their landlord was so stunned by the state of the house he called Merseyside Police on May 1. RSPCA Inspector Claire Fisher visited the disgusting property and was told the pair had taken the surviving cats with them to a new home.

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

We have disagreed with each other more than we have with white people and there exist a number of different ways that we have understood and fought for liberation.The politics of black radicalism are misunderstood and misrepresented, often written off as anti-white, violent and led by men intent on dominating women. In this lazy caricature we have dismissed one of the most important political movements, and the aim of my book, Back to Black, is to reclaim black radicalism, which is as vital for this generation as it has ever been.Malcolm X best articulates black radicalism, which seeks nothing short of a revolution to overturn the racist social order. He is not featured on the list because there is no single book that captures the range and depth of his social theory. In remembering Malcolm, we have enshrined the stereotype of black radicals, while ignoring the political programme. The Autobiography of Malcolm X, written by Alex Haley, is the most guilty of this cultivation of his image, purposefully leaving out the account of Organisation of Afro-American Unity, the very project Malcolm was working at when he died. Subsequent collections of speeches highlight the version of Malcolm that the editor wanted to portray. To truly appreciate Malcolm X, listen to his speeches. Ten books that do provide a good basis for understanding the politics of black radicalism are:1. Stokely Speaks: From Black Power to Pan-Africanism by Kwame Ture (1971)This was the first book I read from my parents extensive bookshelves, mostly because of its comical front cover with Stokely Carmichael (later Kwame Ture) in sunglasses, holding a shotgun over his head. It is no exaggeration to say that this book, more than any other, changed my life. After reading how he connected the black American situation with the global struggle for freedom, nothing ever looked the same again.2. Garvey and Garveyism by Amy Jacques Garvey (1963)The Universal Negro Improvement Association, founded in 1914, grew into largest and most influential black political organisation of all time. At its peak it had millions of members across the African diaspora, long before the days of social media or even widespread use of the telephone. Marcus Garvey is most credited with the rise of the organisation, but black women were the backbone of the movement, representing more than half of the membership. Amy Jacques Garvey was indispensable to the organisation and curated the memory of her husband in both the Philosophy and Opinions and in Garvey and Garveyism, which also includes her own writing.3. Africa Must Unite by Kwame Nkrumah (1963)At the heart of black radicalism is the idea of the African revolution, a process that ultimately tears down colonial borders and creates a unified state that can provide for all people on the continent and in the diaspora. Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana, which had the first successful liberation struggle in what is known as sub-Saharan Africa, presents the best case and vision of the African revolution.4. Beyond Containment by Claudia Jones (2010)A collection of speeches and writing from one of the most under-appreciated black radical activists. Born in Trinidad, Jones was deported from the US because of her communism to Britain, where she made an immediate impact. Jones founded the first black newspaper in the nation, the West Indian Gazette, and started what became Notting Hill Carnival in the aftermath of the 1958 race riots. Her work is also a reminder of the role that black activists have played in the development of Marxism.5. Black Jacobins by CLR James (1938)In 1804, the people of Haiti completed the only successful slave rebellion in history, liberating themselves from the shackles of France. James charts the history of the revolution and all of the factors that went into its success. Across Africa, the Americas and the Caribbean, there was never any passive acceptance of the system, with revolts led by Zumbi (Brazil), Bussa (Barbados) and Sam Sharpe (Jamaica).6. Assata: An Autobiography by Assata Shakur (1987)Shakur’s story has continued to inspire a generation of activists. Convicted of killing a state trooper in 1973, a charge she has always denied, after years of abuse and giving birth in prison she managed to escape in 1979. To this day, Shakur lives with political asylum in Cuba. As well as an inspiration, she is a reminder that the system she fought against is alive and well.7. The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon (1961)A classic text by an influential theorist of liberation. Fanon lays bare the hypocrisy of the purveyors of horrendous colonial violence, who insist that the oppressed be peaceful in their resistance. The book also presents a forensic analysis of the limits of national struggle and builds on Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks, which examined the necessity of a revolutionary identity to bring about social change.9. Revolution in Guinea by Amílcar Cabral (1979)The first task in reviving radical politics is convincing people that revolution is possible. Less than a lifetime ago, it was not clear that capitalism would survive the threat from communism and revolts across developing countries. Revolution in Guinea is an account on the roots and practice of the liberation struggle, which ultimately succeeded after Cabral’s death in 1973. Although the revolution ultimately failed to transform Guinea, it is important to learn from these experiences of struggle.10. Black Feminist Thought by Patricia Hill Collins (2000)Universities were the sites that produced the very racism we are fighting, and they maintain white privilege today. Hill Collins provides a blueprint for bridging the gap between the ivory tower and black communities in the form of black feminist thought. By embracing the standpoint of the oppressed, even pampered academics can reach beyond our privileged location and engage in the struggles for liberation outside the hallowed walls of the university.• Back to Black: Retelling Black Radicalism for the 21st Century by Kehinde Andrews is published in paperback by Zed Books.

US manufacturers posted the biggest contraction in September since the end of the 2009 recession, reflecting a slowdown in the US and global economies made worse by the tit-for-tat trade war with China.The news followed surveys across Europe showing manufacturers reducing the number of shifts and and reducing workers’ hours.

He will be succeeded next summer by Ken Murphy, a Boots lifer who most recently was the chief commercial officer of its American parent Walgreens Boots Alliance.“My decision to step down as group chief executive is a personal one,” said Lewis. “I believe the tenure of the chief executive should be a finite one and that now is the right time to pass the baton.”The 54-year-old made it clear that he did not have another job to go to and was “not discussing options with anyone”. “I want to take some proper time out with my family and recharge my batteries,” he said. “You pass this way only once.”The Tesco chairman, John Allan, said that it was with regret that he had accepted Lewis’s resignation. “Dave has done an outstanding job in rebuilding Tesco since 2014 and he continues to have unwavering support from the board,” Allan said.Murphy, an Irishman, studied at University College Cork, before going on to qualify as an accountant. Allan described him as a seasoned leader with “deep commercial, marketing and brand experience within retail and wholesale businesses”.Shore Capital analyst Clive Black described Lewis as “the bloke that saved Tesco which should go down as an enormous achievement in British retail history”. He said Lewis’s departure would be a loss to the group leaving Murphy with “big shoes to fill”.Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said Lewis was able to say he was leaving with his “mission accomplished” but questioned why Tesco had chosen an external candidate to succeed him.“What Dave Lewis will do next is unclear but the bigger question is why Tesco overlooked an array of internal candidates and have gone outside and appointed Ken Murphy from Boots (aka ‘Ken who?’) as the new boss,” said Bubb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/447d1b5b661627f0c5973c496895a7598d57f442/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36a00b315050378f610837722be94f30","title":"alexander skarsgard i spend hours thinking what kind of shoes would this guy wear","story":"The actor talks about 90s style, itchy jumpers and how he pays much more attention to his characters’ outfits than his ownThis is a suit I wore while filming On Becoming a God in Central Florida.

He wants to look like a successful businessman but he doesn’t have much style or taste. Bad style in the early 90s gives you a plethora of horrible, horrible outfits. It was one of my favourite characters to create in terms of the look and the hair. It’s always fun when you create a character who looks different from the way they feel. He has bought into a pyramid scheme, so in order to recruit more people he wants to look important and successful. We had a lot of fun putting together some ostentatious and quite tacky outfits, culminating in a very ill-fitting tuxedo.Going to costume fittings is always instrumental, for me, in finding the character. I spend hours thinking: “What kind of shoe would this guy wear? What kind of jacket?” It’s always a collaboration between me and the costume designer and I will agonise over an outfit – if I find a great pair of shoes, but they are slightly the wrong colour, that can bother me a lot.In my personal life, I don’t pay much attention to what I wear – it’s the other end of the spectrum and I like to just switch off. I don’t have the energy to spend more than two minutes thinking about it in the morning and so I pretty much wear the same thing every day.

Here’s what you need to know about the eco-friendly fabric that has caught the attention of forward-thinking designers.Despite being synonymous with dust-coloured sacks, hemp is, in fact, used in more than 25,000 products globally. The fabric is comprised of long strands of fibre from within the stalk of plants such as flax, jute and stinging nettle, and bears some resemblance to a matted horse’s mane before processing. The fibres are then spun together to produce a thread that can be woven into a fabric.Hemp’s strength and durability means clothes made from it last longer. However, this has fuelled the misconception that hemp clothing is rigid and uncomfortable. “It needs the drive of designers and makers to use hemp proudly in a fashion-forward way,” says Stephanie Steele, a customer experience manager at Offset Warehouse who specialises in eco fabrics.Hemp’s nickname as “marijuana’s cousin” often distracts from the fabric’s many beneficial uses. “A high percentage of citizens do not know the difference between industrial hemp and cannabis, and get the two mixed up frequently,” Sarah Hayes, director of material development at outdoor clothing company Patagonia, told Hypebeast.“Cotton has become the more prevalent a crop, because of its wide availability and low price,” says Steele. “Because hemp was increasingly stigmatised and gained deeper negative connotations, it stopped being grown.”Hemp, like marijuana, belongs to the cannabis genus of plants. This genus as a whole is classified as a controlled substance in the UK and therefore hemp is illegal to grow without a licence from the Home Office. As a result, it is rarely grown in the UK. Across the pond, however, the legalisation of industrial hemp last December is allowing US farmers to gather government subsidies to farm the crop.In addition to the stigma, brands are prevented from promoting hemp products on social media due to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook’s restrictions on cannabis-related products.Hemp has not had the industrial support of its mainstream counterparts, such as cotton, and therefore its growth as an industry has been stunted. Demand is lower than that of other fabrics and therefore it is more expensive. Steele believes this is down to a lack of understanding.“As hemp is generally only allowed to be grown in parts of the US and China currently, there isn’t the awareness of where it can be obtained from, the blends available and what the fibre’s qualities are,” she says. “Without the supply, there isn’t demand, and without the demand, there isn’t supply.”Hemp wrinkles easily and is not always rich in colour unless it is combined with other materials. However, brands such as Levi’s and Eileen Fisher have begun incorporating hemp into their collections by blending it with cotton to produce soft, wearable products that are significantly better for the environment. Paul Dillinger, Levi’s head of innovation, has spoken about the brand’s plans to improve the quality of its cottonised-hemp so that, in the future, its hemp garments will feel like cotton.What’s more, recent developments in processes that allow hemp fibres to be made softer have signalled that hemp has the potential to be a frontrunner in the fabric market.The legalisation of cultivation, processing, and sale of hemp in the US last December, combined with the increasing pressure on fashion brands to make their practises more eco-friendly, has resulted in more and more brands experimenting with using the fabric.If anything can help boost interest in hemp it is legalisation from a world superpower. The US Farm bill has opened the floodgates to hemp production and the fabric’s incorporation into fashion.With an increasing number of fashion brands using the fabric for more than just a quick gimmick to sell “hippy chic”, it looks as if hemp’s place in La Vie Bohème could soon become a distant memory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b79431f6eca4e9969e808fb2291f0710cda5715/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da7413461f3b434e6e409f442b1a7f7 700w","title":"werewolf review adrian panek horror film","story":"A group of teenagers liberated from a Nazi concentration camp face a terrible new threat in this disturbing, challenging dramaThere’s a very horrible premise to this feral ordeal from Polish writer-director Adrian Panek, a follow-up to his 2011 debut Daas, a mysterious fable about a messianic figure in 18th-century Poland.Werewolf is set at the end of the second world war. A group of teenage children are liberated by approaching Soviet forces from the Nazis’ Gross-Rosen concentration camp in south-western Poland. This is the point in most stories where the nightmare might be deemed to have ended. Not here.The young people, still in their camp uniforms (they have no other clothes) are taken to a chaotically derelict, abandoned stately home in the forest, with no reliable electricity or running water, and dumped in this makeshift orphanage under the notional supervision of an embittered and distracted house mother.Food supplies are down almost to zero, marauding Soviet and Nazi soldiers are rumoured to be everywhere about, but the main horror is that the camp guard dogs are now running wild, crazed with starvation and closing in on the children’s unstable fortress.It’s a story with a mix of Lord of the Flies and Assault on Precinct 13. The dogs and the children have something in common: their overwhelming, unbearable hunger. The tensions between the young prisoners are accentuated and accelerated by this horrendous situation, and things are not helped by an indication that one of them might have worked out the German words of command to control the dogs.It’s a disturbing, challenging drama, but one that perhaps begins to lose its narrative focus as the story proceeds. The children’s faces – pinched, starved, tensed with fear, pain and urge to survive – are piercingly disturbing and real.• Werewolf is released in the UK on 4 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02cbc83deecc51a3b8f398867053977cdd8b6348/0_1270_7348_4410/master/7348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6de3518f6f530eb2a52f42434ff2bc12","title":"how to cook the perfect apple and blackberry pie recipe felicity cloake","story":"Apples bulk up the berries in this quintessentially British pie that sings of autumnIf there’s anything more seasonal than an apple pie, it’s an apple and blackberry pie, described by Tamasin Day-Lewis as the autumn pie, while Nigel Slater reckons it’s “almost impossible to think of a dish that so accurately expresses the glories of the British countryside in autumn”. Few can fail to have bittersweet memories of past tangles with thorny brambles – one for the mouth, one for the bag – and though it takes a dedicated picker to amass enough to feed a family, they make a happy pair with their seasonal bedfellow, the apple, helping even the most meagre of harvests to stretch a little further. If you’re lucky enough to have a glut, freeze them to enjoy this recipe throughout the winter.The perennially sensible Jane Grigson writes in her Fruit Book that, “when you pick blackberries in the autumn, and gather windfall apples to make this pie, quantity and variety of fruit do not much come into it. You make the best of what you have. This is the way it should be.”Though flavours do indeed differ, this can easily be adjusted with sugar and lemon juice, but the texture of cooking apples is very different from that of dessert varieties. While bramleys break down into a jammy paste when heated, eating apples tend to keep their shape, especially when added to the pie raw, as Day-Lewis suggests. Perfectly pleasant, if time is of the essence, but McMorland Hunter and Hughes cook theirs first, so that the bramleys disintegrate and the dessert apples stay whole but slightly softened. This feels like the best of both worlds: the pureed apples adding moisture while filling the cavity of the pie, and the chunks of dessert apple offering a contrast in texture to the soft berries and bramleys.Grigson, interestingly, takes a very different approach, cooking down half the blackberries with the apple peels, cores and a generous helping of sugar to produce a fruity syrup that she then pours over the remaining raw fruit. It’s delicious, but only suitable for a plate pie, rather than one encased in pastry, because it makes the filling very liquid.If you do have time to cook the apples, my testers and I all like Leigh’s approach of frying them in butter and sugar, which adds richness to the filling, and McMorland Hunter and Hughes’ splash of brandy. Neither rather decadent addition is strictly necessary, but both are delicious if you happen to have them to hand.Slater dusts his apples with a mere sprinkling of sugar, because he likes them “fairly tart”, but he tells readers with a sweeter tooth to heap on “anything up to a tablespoon per apple”. This is a sensible approach – after all, apples, as well as tastes, vary greatly – but however much you add, I’d recommend going for a brown sugar. We find McMorland Hunter and Hughes’ dark muscovado too intensely treacley, but the caramel flavour of Day-Lewis’ demerara or light muscovado works wonderfully with the sharpness of the apple.Everyone uses shortcrust of some variety, and mostly plain, though seeing as Grigson is non-specific, I go for crisp paté sucrée on her pie. A sweet filling, however, seems to me to demand a more savoury enclosure – Slater keeps it light and crumbly with a lard and butter mixture, but we’re sold on Leigh’s softer, yolk-enriched recipe. This is a pudding, after all.Surprisingly, only a couple of the recipes line the dish with pastry before adding the fruit. In my opinion, a plate pie doesn’t offer a robust enough ratio of pastry to fruit here, but as Leigh notes, “it is a challenge to cook the bottom crust properly: it needs a lot of heat from below, and a fair bit of time”, so it’s worth heating a baking sheet in the oven first to help with this. Sprinkle the top with sugar for extra crunch and, like Slater, you may find yourself moved to wave a little flag in honour of this national treasure.2 cooking apples4 crisp, sharp eating apples Juice of 1 lemon25g butter3 tbsp demerara sugar, or to taste1 tbsp brandy or rum (optional)300g blackberries, or however many you have1 splash milkFor the pastry350g plain flour, plus extra for dusting1 pinch salt200g cold butter2 eggsFirst make the pastry.

Use this to line the base and side of a greased pie dish about 24cm wide, leaving an overhang around the edge, then spoon in the cooled filling.Roll out the second piece of pastry. Beat the reserved egg white with the splash of milk, brush this all around the rim of the pastry lining the dish, then lay the lid on top, pressing together the two pieces of pastry all around the rim to seal trim off any excess (if you like, you can roll this again and cut into shapes to stick on top).Brush the top with more of the egg white and milk mixture, sprinkle with the remaining sugar and cut two holes in the top to allow the steam to escape.

The tabloid said that Bayern had been “merciless” and that the victory had “shocked Europe”.Matthias Brügelmann noted that Bayern have, in Joshua Kimmich and Robert Lewandowski, leaders who want two win everything, similar to the desire shown by Liverpool when they won the Champions League last season. “They want to win ‘the big one’ and that is why they always give everything on the pitch,” he wrote before adding: “and that is why they don’t care if they annoy the top people at the club, the coach or their teammates.”Bild also wrote about Karl-Heinz Rummenigge’s speech after the game and before the dinner, in which he described the performance and result as “memorable” and added that the team “had made history”.He especially thanked the coach, Niko Kovac, who has had a difficult time at Bayern since joining at the start of last season, saying that they had seen something “unbelievable” at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Rummenigge also said that Bayern had proved that a Bundesliga team were capable of beating a top Premier League side and for that he was thankful.Kicker, notoriously stingy when it comes to player ratings, handed out three “Einser”, the best possible mark, to Manuel Neuer, Serge Gnabry and Lewandowski, while Toby Alderweireld suffered the ignominy of being given the rarely seen “6.0”. Son Heung-min was the only Spurs player to escape with a decent mark.The local Munich paper, Abend-Zeitung, said Bayern had won “with an impressive canter” and there was special praise for Gnabry, who was labelled “the Fourminator” after his four-goal haul.But what was his reward, wondered Patrick Strasser in the same paper. “His reward seemed to be a sliding tackle from Niklas Süle that made Gnabry fly out of the pitch as the players celebrated, and then followed the next setback as Javi Martínez took the match ball and booted it high into the stands where the Bayern fans were standing. Both actions worthy of a yellow.”Gnabry spoke of “one of the best games of his career” and “a wonderful feeling in what was for us a super night”. The former Arsenal player added: “I could never have dreamed of scoring four in a Champions League game. That is incredible. I haven’t won 7-2 that often and I haven’t scored four in a game since I was playing for the youth teams.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f22d828f07d8a48c25effc5848e3638b4849a28/0_202_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2faec1fbef58c3f872b85852b3af1ac","title":"gareth ainsworth wycombe football league","story":"Second-longest serving manager in the country is changing perceptions of Wycombe who are flying high in League OneFor a man nicknamed Wild Thing going back to his playing days at Wimbledon and who drives an orange 1969 fastback Ford Mustang, it is an apt analogy. Ian Holloway, who signed the former winger for Queens Park Rangers in 2003, said Ainsworth’s full-throttle style embodied the sports car. “Great in straight lines, very powerful engine, very quick accelerating, I don’t know about putting a cross in … but that was definitely my playing career,” Ainsworth, who still plays for ninth-tier Woodley United, says, smiling. “In management terms I’ve moved away from the Mustang, a basic straight-line, look-at-me car. I’m more of a thinker now than I’ve ever been and I’m proud I’ve developed into this. I was nowhere near this when I first took over.”September marked his seventh anniversary in charge and, in that time, he feels he has matured immeasurably but Ainsworth, the second-longest serving manager in the country behind Morecambe’s Jim Bentley, remains the same infectious and gregarious character it is easy to see why players and staff run through brick walls for him. Supporters adore Ainsworth and the feeling is mutual. The 46-year-old describes the club as “semi-family” this summer he and the chairman Trevor Stroud attended a season-ticket holder’s funeral in nearby Amersham. Ainsworth has turned down advances from Barnsley, Notts County and, most recently, Lincoln to stay put at Adams Park, where an important decision is looming. This month Wycombe, fan-owned since 2012, will vote on selling a majority shareholding to Rob Couhig, an American investor who came close to buying Yeovil in May. “I believe we need it we could be in some serious trouble if that doesn’t go ahead.”Ainsworth has done a remarkable job at Wycombe but is fiercely ambitious to taste further success. Eddie Howe, Chris Wilder and Sean Dyche, each of whom are managing in the Premier League after winning promotion with their respective clubs, fuel his desire to manage at the highest level. “It shows the power of longevity and what can happen at a club. They are great inspiration for me but anyone who has been in charge for a long time and built something I’m inspired by and I’ve got a lot of empathy for, because it’s a tough job.”Above all, Ainsworth says, a healthy work-life balance is most important. “Moments like watching my boy play football or my girls play netball, it’s just trying to get to those games,” he says. “When he turns round when he’s made a good tackle – I don’t know where he got that from – or a good clearance or when he saves a goal and looks at you … you can’t buy those moments and you don’t want to miss those moments. They’re really special.”• The Derby owner, Mel Morris, addressed Phillip Cocu’s squad on Thursday following a car crash that resulted in Mason Bennett and Tom Lawrence being charged for drink driving and Richard Keogh out for more than 15 months after sustaining knee ligament damage. Derby, who travel to Barnsley on Wednesday, say a “rigorous internal investigation” is ongoing, with the club obtaining statements from external agencies. Morris, who mingled with fans before Saturday’s win over Birmingham, is understood to feel severely let down by the incident. Bennett and Lawrence are due in court on 15 October.• “He gives me sleepless nights, we have our fights and bust-ups, let me tell you, but he’s brilliant,” the Bristol Rovers manager, Graham Coughlan, said of Jonson Clarke‑Harris. The 25-year-old striker has scored eight goals in 12 appearance this season and 18 league goals in 26 games since joining from Coventry in January, prompting Championship interest.• The Southend chairman, Ron Martin, flew to Stockholm on Tuesday morning to “meet potential backroom staff” with the former Sweden striker Henrik Larsson among five managers shortlisted and interviewed for the vacancy following Kevin Bond’s sacking, including Gary Waddock, who is in interim charge. Martin hopes to make an appointment by the end of this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba424dd3346833b8524a4c7ac732de818de0eef4/0_246_4400_2639/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4437c2d08b7bd823bf653e717f09b87","title":"thomas cook visa refused boarding refund","story":"They lost their holiday and £2,400 after being wrongly refused boardingI booked flights to Mallorca for a family holiday in June through Thomas Cook.

This holiday was inexpressibly important to us after a stressful year, but we had no option but to return home.

Over the ensuing nine days I battled to extract redress from the company for your abysmal treatment. It blamed a “system error” and offered to refund your flights and associated costs, including accommodation you’d booked through another provider. It added a derisory £300 as goodwill between the three of you. Only after further badgering did it concede that you were owed compensation of €400 each for denied boarding under EU regulations. Then all went quiet. A week ago, it promised to look into why the money hadn’t reached you. Five days later it went into administration along with £2,400 it owed you.Since you paid by debit card you are not protected by the Consumer Credit Act, which holds credit-card issuers jointly liable for a breach of contract. Visa operates a similar chargeback scheme for debit-card users, but it’s a voluntary protection rather than a legal obligation and you have to claim within 120 days of the purchase.Your shocking experience is not uncommon. Following the 1985 Schengen agreement for a borderless Europe, airlines were effectively appointed as immigration controllers. They face fines of up to €5,000 if they are found to have carried inadequately documented passengers and pay to return them to the country they flew from.The inevitable result is that the airlines err on the side of caution and, if they are presented with documents they are not familiar with, it is cheaper to turn passengers away.This, of course, means that refugees and asylum seekers who don’t hold full EU passports are disproportionately affected. Judging from the cases that have come my way, they lose not only their holiday but their money, since airlines do not readily refund the fare unless a headline looms. It’s sickening that, due to Thomas Cook’s incompetence and prevarication, you’ve lost out once again.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

In the five months since my daughter Riri was born, we have barely been apart. Motherhood, for me, has been a meditation – a scrunchie-wearing, vomit-stained, oxytocin-induced trance. When Shaun, who is playing guitar at the London show, came over yesterday to rehearse, I could barely speak. Riri and I are codependent. I only know the language of nappy rash and baby-led weaning.My only consolation this morning was putting her in a new onesie. It has the cast of Frasier dressed up as Kiss on it, and it says “I’m Listening Tour”. I take photos of her as we wait for Caz, our tour manager, to arrive. Then I realise that Caz will arrive at some point. I rush upstairs to throw muslins into a suitcase. My guitars have been packed for days, gathering dust in the hall. At this point, I’d rather forget a guitar than a breast pump.As the van pulls up, I nervously eye the unbelievable pile of baby equipment on the doorstep. I had forgotten the key part of touring was loading and unloading. My Auntie Lesley, who has volunteered for childcare, is our only crew. She is a retired flight attendant and not a roadie. Riri is a baby, and not a roadie. I hand her to Auntie, and start lifting cases. Thanks to the muscle memory of past tours, this gives me a thrill.Twenty minutes into the drive, Riri takes her biggest ever shit. The Frasier sleepsuit is removed in a petrol station forecourt on the M25. We drive for six hours, stopping often for feeds. We are incredibly late for soundcheck. Then we are late getting to the hotel for the bedtime routine. Then I am late getting on stage, because I was laundering pooey clothes in the bathtub. “Hello everybody!” I say, forgetting the lyrics to every song.But my fans are my friends. They know I’ve just had a baby. They take their phones out and Google the lyrics. They laugh as my fingers land on all the wrong strings for the final riff of Dylan, and give thumbs ups when I start War again on the piano. At the end of the set, they line up to tell me, at the merch desk, that it gets easier. They tweet kind words of support, which I scroll through on the way to the hotel, my baby’s poo still under my nails. Then I run towards our room and lie beside her absolutely enormous and cumbersome sleep pod, holding her hand and murmuring that I will never leave her again.Our travelling party sounds like a mashup of 90s films – Four Women and a Baby. As well as Auntie, Caz, Riri and I, there is Bishi, the special guest at the shows. After breakfast, she meets us at the hotel lobby and shyly asks for a cuddle from Riri.“Did you sleep?” she asks, following up from the conversation we had yesterday when we met. Bishi, a genuinely friendly person, tried to get to know us. Even though her album, Albion Voice, is one of my favourites, I could only babble: “Riri is going through a sleep regression. She wakes up every hour.”The regression came on a week before tour. I fear it will get worse now that Riri is separated from her dad, who couldn’t get the time off work. Before we left for tour, I told him: “I’m sure it will be fine to combine touring and baby care, the two most exhausting things I’ve ever experienced.” On the road towards Newcastle, I hold Riri’s hand as she sleeps in the car seat, and nap for two glorious, unbroken hours. It’s the most rested I’ve felt in months.Soundcheck is also the longest I’ve been away from Riri. With a bit of headspace, I am able to talk to Bishi properly. She lets me handle her Ableton Push, and we debate the best EQ for her sitar. I feel almost normal. When the gig begins, I remember how to perform.At the end of the gig, my boobs fill up with milk. I check the time. Later, at the hotel, Auntie tells me that Riri cried at around 10:45. “I know,” I say.Tomorrow is our day off. Tour manager Caz’s parents have kindly invited us to stay at their house tonight, and Riri has a firm playdate with Caz’s two kids tomorrow. All this is taking place in Bedford, so tonight Riri and Auntie will hang in the dressing room during the gig. There will be no bedtime routine in a hotel.Just before soundcheck, I realise I didn’t load the nappies. I pop out to the van to get them. There are no windows in the boot of the van, and I fumble to reach the bag in the far corner. I hear a slam. In total darkness, I cannot feel a handle on the inside of the door.Because I am trying to use my phone less around the baby, I did not bring it, so I can’t call anyone or use the flashlight. Cold sweat gathers on my palms as I start pounding on the side of the van, yelling for someone to come. I can’t tell if the panic is because of the enclosed space, or because Auntie might get Riri hooked on formula while I wait to be rescued. After five minutes, an extremely nervous man opens the boot from the outside. He looks unsure of whether he’s just busted a human trafficking ring. I wave the diaper bag. “Forgot nappies! Hahaha!”After the gig, there is a club night. I beg the DJ not to turn the volume up until I’ve got the baby out of the building. She turns it down for half a second, then quite clearly makes it 12 times louder. (If you’re reading this, Dr Ho, Riri is safely in the dressing room with ears covered. Please don’t quit being our paediatrician.)I think about the concept of the “good-enough mother”. Sure, a perfect mother wouldn’t unload her infant through a club night on Friday in Birmingham, but maybe a good-enough mother would? Pondering this, I run down the fire exit, into the street.There is a new mum in the venue who has left her six-week-old at home. “I’ve just spilled all my breast milk in the Portaloo,” she says. “I thought you would understand my pain.” She is right. I can literally think of nothing more depressing than wasting a pumped feed. “You really can cry over spilled milk,” she says, as we hug.Manchester is a home-on-tour for me. I have a friend here, Bernie, who I have been staying with since my very first days of making music. Back then, her youngest child was eight. Now he’s an adult, and I am about to introduce her to my baby.I am almost shy as we park in the familiar drive, self-conscious about the changes that motherhood has wrought in me. But it is heaven to be back with Bernie. Tonight will be emotional. We have invited Nicky from the Earlies, who co-produced my first album, to the show. Bernie is coming too, with her daughter Alice.At the venue, Caz and I load our gear up the outdoor staircase, through pouring rain. After soundcheck, we drive back to Bernie’s to feed. Although it’s really, really annoying to carry a stage piano up slippery iron steps, I am amazed by us – two mothers with three children between us, rolling around Greater Manchester in our transit van. We have already admitted to each other that touring, even with a baby, is easier than being on primary carer duty.The gig is everything I hoped it would be. Just before Caz and I carry the equipment back down the stairs, I catch Nicky. When we made the album, 10 years ago, we finished every session at the pub. Tonight, we take our phones out and compare daughters. Then he goes home to get an early night. “School tomorrow,” he says.Until today, the gigs have meant less than three hours separation from Riri. Now I am going away for the entire day. As the taxi comes to pick me up for the Union Chapel, I feel as though I’m being dragged away for an execution (I’ve been listening to an Anne Boleyn audiobook).Caz has brought her three-year-old to soundcheck. He strides around the stage, clearly comfortable in a venue, handing his mum masking tape when she needs it.Tom, the pianist who produced First Love with me, arrives for soundcheck. His son is a year old, and we talk endlessly about sleep routines. Ed, our old friend and frontman for Stats, joins in. His son is 14 months. I am talking just to join in. I know nothing can help me.Since the night she went to a rave in Birmingham, Riri has fundamentally forgotten how to sleep. I feel like I am hallucinating from sleep deprivation. Thank God for my memories of Glastonbury 2009, or I wouldn’t believe that I could perform while feeling this tired.I’ve invited a lot of friends to the gig, and as the crowd begins to fill, I wander the aisles of the venue, looking for them. This is how I bump into Alex, who once booked me to play a gig in his garden. He is here with his partner and a tiny, tiny baby. I am immensely impressed. I should have brought my baby, I think. But I already suggested to Auntie that I strap Riri to my back for the shows, and was kicked out of the aparthotel.Without the baby, I am finally able to watch the other acts. Stats and Bishi are both extraordinary. I can’t believe I’m out so late! And at a gig!As my show begins, a voice in my head tells me I should be thinking about my child. Try to disassociate from the performance and think only about your baby, it suggests, seducing me. But Union Chapel is my favourite venue, and it’s sold out. This feels too good to give up. I give myself permission to focus.For the penultimate song of the evening, I bring on all the people in the crowd who mean the most to me – family and musical collaborators. For the briefest of moments, I forget that I am a parent. I forget that I am tired. I forget that I am at work. I forget that I need to get back early for the night wakings. I am a performer, I am surrounded by love.One last song, dedicated to Riri and her dad, then the spell is broken. I thank the audience, meaning it more than ever before – they got me out of the house. Then, because Caz, Tom, Ed, the promoter, my agent, and most of the venue staff have kids at home, we all get the hell out of there.• Emmy the Great is an ambassador for Parents and Carers in Performing Arts, an organisation that raises awareness of the challenges facing carers and parents working in the performing arts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dd571c3f328731f92c7ab96a6bd50aa80177f6/0_0_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974970140b8c194c5d8aff7cd26563c","title":"is it over for justin trudeau podcast","story":"The Canadian prime minister achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future less certain.

Eddie Jones has taken England on tour to Japan to have a dry run for the big show and the red rose also played short turnaround fixtures to replicate what they would face in the real thing. Planning doesn’t often get the headlines but it is crucial to deliver the foundations of the performances you want and with seven games for the final four in various destinations at various times of the day, you need to have done more than just your due diligence.Now we are beginning to get to the pointy end of group exits and the knockouts, comfort gained from confidence that the route planned is the right one is crucial. It’s an area of high performance I love.You rarely hear coaches after a great victory talking poetically about how they managed their weekly schedule but they, along with the ever expanding backroom staff, will have spent an inordinate amount of time on the detail. It’s an expanding field within elite sport and while we often read how British Cycling and other Olympic sports have used this side of medal hunting, in rugby it’s become a fast accelerating tool to maximise.You need to get big and mini peaks right both for teams and players. The change in the Premiership – with play offs replacing first past the post – began to embed this deeper in the English game. Peaking all the time isn’t possible but at the right time – that’s the art with the science.Sports medicine and science departments are all common in the top teams and even 10 years ago, that wasn’t the case. Normally a keen physio with an eye on technology or a conditioner ahead of the curve covered it but now it is deep and detailed.Big-ticket understanding of flights, accommodation and recovery facilities as well as tournament venues will all have been recced and on the docket in detail. Underneath that the jet lag protocols will be in place and by now, normal circadian service should have been resumed.Travel within a country, especially in Japan, needs to be orchestrated perfectly. Leave training a few minutes later than you wanted in the floating world of Tokyo and you could easily double your travel time, causing a domino effect for the rest of your day. A game week needs to have the right balance of exertion and workload for everyone to match the goals for a particular game.Within all that are the smaller parts of planning around the types of meals and nutrition to help aid sleep, energy and recovery, the balance between coach and player-led meetings and time together and time off as well as the local nuances that could significantly knock you off the road you have planned to travel.Research and then application of humidity strategy will have been actioned. Sweat can be analysed as well as players regularly given osmolarity testing and weighing in and out to make sure they are hydrated. Saline drips would give all players the best chance of getting their essential minerals back and hydration up but that would be breaking Wada rules, so a slower method is needed to get the players back to their best.Games still seem to be affected by humidity and slippery match balls. Interestingly, and as an aside I genuinely wonder how much of that is the use of brand new match balls. Unused balls will have a waxy layer and most ground staff around the world know that, so normally those balls are thrown in the washing machine and then kicked and passed around a bit before they reach the match. In planning, you always assume nothing but I do wonder if this simple practice has slipped the net thus far.A phrase coined first by a 19th-century Prussian military commander – “no plan survives first contact with the enemy” – is true to the extent that a planning structure that can bend in the breeze has to be in place but not to the point that you level it all after an unexpected loss or a performance that dipped to depths you didn’t see coming. Unless the major supporting beams of your planning are wrong or even not present then the mantra “plan your work and work your plan” still needs to be applied.Of course teams along their road to winning have had some pot holes to navigate around in those stratagems. The All Blacks’ 2011 fly-half decimation – where injury took their first three and led to their fourth choice being brought in and kicking the winning penalty in the final – was just one example. It provided threats to their goals but their overarching plans were in place and they stuck to their frameworks and protocols.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterOften teams throw the baby out with the bath water after a debilitating loss but for Australia, South Africa or Ireland, if they are to buck that unbeaten trend, then they need to sway but not snap the blueprints they have put in place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868c2288b70dcc5ff13e68331bbc6b87d5bdab38/0_232_4730_2839/master/4730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5c197390e46580111355461e346b922","title":"france usa rugby world cup match report","story":"It was another sticky night at the World Cup, although this time you couldn’t really be sure whether it was the heat, the humidity, or the stress that had France sweating. Either way, with 15 minutes to play, they found themselves defending a three-point lead, 12-9 up against a spirited, stubborn USA who just wouldn’t roll over. And while France pulled away after that, and ended up winning 33-9, their coach, Jacques Brunel, did not seem too convinced himself. “He played well and he didn’t play well,” was Brunel gnomic comment about one of his players. That about covered the team’s performance, too.Brunel blamed it on the conditions. “It was very humid, and we weren’t able to control the match, the ball was very slippery and we made a lot of mistakes.” They sure did. The French lived up to all the favourite old stereotypes. They were wretchedly flaky, glaringly flawed, recklessly indisciplined, and utterly fantastic on the occasions they managed to hold on to the ball. Much more of this and they might beat anyone in this World Cup, much more of this and they might just blow up. They scored five tries, and four of them were utterly glorious.In the first half the USA had the better of them in every way except the one that mattered most. They had more of the territory, and more of the possession, and their well-drilled, powerful pack had a clear advantage at the scrum, winning six out of eight with one against the head. Their problem was that in between all that, the French kept doing that thing they do, or that thing they always used to. They took the lead with a try right out of rose-tinted memory.One minute, the USA’s Martin Iosefo was haring up the left wing chasing his own kick into the French territory, the next, everything had flipped, and the French were flooding back down the field. Their tighthead, Emerick Setiano, far too fast and fleet to be a prop, trampled through one tackle, their lock, Bernard Le Roux, broke another, and then, in the next phase, Camille Lopez knocked a dainty little chip over the rush defence. Yoann Huget plucked it out of the air mid-stride as he sprinted to the try-line.Lopez made their second too, with a fine cross-field kick back against the grain of play, all the way to Alivereti Raka on the far wing. While their fly-half is in this form, the French will fancy their chances of scoring against any defence in the tournament. Given how indisciplined they were the rest of the time, the feeling will be mutual. They conceded eight penalties in the first half alone, some of them so cynical that they were lucky it only cost them six points, and not a spell or two in the sin-bin, too.They tightened up at half-time, when they switched around their entire front row, which improved their set-pieces, too. Still, the score was stuck at 12-6 for the next 25 minutes, till AJ MacGinty kicked his third penalty for the USA. That seemed to spur the French into life. They rolled down field after the restart, through 15 phases, and Gaël Fickou burrowed over from close range. Baptiste Serin picked up their fourth soon after, finishing off a merry spree of broken-field running after another brilliant kick by Lopez. Jefferson Poirot got the last at the back of a rolling maul.Even though his team have faced France and England in back-to-back matches, the USA’s coach Gary Gold was not going to be suckered into making predictions about how the pool game between the two of them is going to play out next week.“It’s difficult because you’ll find they’re two very different teams when they’re going at each other,” Gold explained, “but a nil-nil draw would suit us perfectly.” The way France are playing, that’s the one result you can rule out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a25a6d612e65c90c23aac6d6333579068c5b1aa/0_112_3677_2206/master/3677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f9900d6b7f68a2dcd5e5152fe098e6c","title":"new zealand canada rugby world cup match report","story":"• Backs Beauden and Jordie and lock Scott all score tries • Brad Weber scores two in holders’ nine-try demolitionThey came in their tens of thousands to see the one team that resonates here, New Zealand, queueing in their black jerseys in the rain more than four hours before the kick-off, a swarm so dense that stewards struggled to find space for coaches and chauffeured limousines to get through to the car park. It was chaotic, but no one went home disappointed as the holders, easing through the gears as if running in a new car, outclassed committed Canada.New Zealand secured the bonus point five minutes before half-time, but squandered four more opportunities through a mixture of dogged defending, handling errors in conditions which seemed no less humid for the roof being closed and the sloppiness that is often a by-product of mismatches.Four tries in the opening 10 minutes of the second half, including one by Scott Barrett which followed scores by his brothers Beauden and Jordie, doubled the score and gave an indication of what was said at half-time, although it also felt as if someone had belatedly turned on the air-conditioning. The brothers had already become the first trio of siblings to play for New Zealand at a World Cup, and they added another record by all scoring.The All Blacks were crisp, slick and lethal, prompted by Sonny Bill Williams who created three in a row with a dink, a timed pass after drawing the defence and a flick out of the back of his hand.Canada’s moment came on 21 minutes when a Richie Mo’unga fumble was seized on by Gordon McRoirie near his 22. He found Lucas Rumball and the ball was moved to the Ulster outside-half Peter Nelson who took on Beauden Barrett only to be hauled down just short of the line. Not conceding a try was as important to the holders as maximising their opportunities.Otherwise they tackled and tackled, their narrow defence exposed at times but they scrambled, desperate not to give anything away cheaply. The All Blacks moved away through their own skill rather than their opponents’ deficiencies, but it was hard not to feel for a team that included few frontline professionals and who tend to face the big boys mainly when a World Cup rolls around.In the four years between the 2015 tournament and this, Canada had three fixtures against tier one nations, Italy at home and Ireland and Scotland away. Here, they have three in less than three weeks with Italy already faced and South Africa to come. As a model, international rugby makes little sense.Canada kept defending, their sporadic attacks coming off turnovers. They conceded the most points of any side this tournament, but fewer than the 79 they leaked to the All Blacks at Wellington in 2011. Their World Cup will be defined by their match against Namibia, which will decide who doesn’t finish bottom of the pool.For the All Blacks, it is all about success. It was their head coach Steve Hansen’s 103rd match in charge, equalling Graham Henry’s record, and the 90th time he entered a winning dressing room after a game. The danger for the All Blacks is that, with Namibia and Italy to come, their competitive edge may not be at its sharpest come the quarter-finals.It happened in 2007, when Hansen was Henry’s assistant, a hard lesson absorbed. Here they were like Japan in slightly slower motion, the craft of Williams, Mo’unga, Beauden Barrett, Ben Smith and Ryan Crotty supplemented by the drive of Kieran Read, Shannon Frizell and Scott Barrett. Ardie Savea became the first player to wear goggles in a World Cup when he came on 10 minutes from the end.Canada were not humiliated and were on the attack in the final minute when they lost the ball and Beauden Barrett was away on a 50-metre run. Andrew Coe chased him all the way, forcing the full-back to change the hand in which he carried the ball to ready himself for a fend off only to lose control of it. His burst took New Zealand to more than 900 metres running with the ball on a night when Canada attempted a couple short of 200 tackles, outgunned but not outfought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d31a4a66362aee5ef8a726c58c124e36f3b062d/0_102_1276_766/master/1276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0c2e563d9d959992d163ac221b8e46","title":"worlds largest betting firm created with 10bn tsg takeover flutter","story":"Flutter Entertainment to buy The Stars Group, owner of Sky Bet, in £10bn dealFlutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, is to buy The Stars Group (TSG), which owns Sky Bet, in a £10bn deal which will create the world’s largest online betting company by revenue.Flutter bought FanDuel last year as it sought to establish a US bulkhead in the wake of the supreme court’s decision to legalise sports betting, a ruling that triggered a race between UK bookmakers to enter the lucrative new market.Peter Jackson, the chief executive of Flutter, will lead a combined business serving 4 million gamblers in 100 markets.He said the takeover would “turbocharge” the company’s strategy of expansion into new markets while retaining a leading position where it is already well established, in the UK, Ireland and Australia.“We believe the combination of Flutter and TSG will deliver substantial value for shareholders,” he said.“We will have an exceptional portfolio of leading recreational brands and best-in-class products on industry-leading technology platforms.”Flutter’s chairman, Gary McGann, said the combined group would also be a “strong voice in the promotion of responsible gambling worldwide”.In its previous incarnation as Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter agreed a £2.2m penalty for responsible gambling failures last year, a settlement that relates in part to an ongoing legal battle with the victim of an alleged theft by a problem gambler.It was one of the few UK high street bookmakers to support the government’s reduction in stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2.It was accused of trying to bypass the restriction after a  investigation found it had developed a game that mimicked the roulette-style machines while technically abiding by FOBT curbs.It was eventually forced to withdraw the game by the Gambling Commission.Analysts said the takeover of TSG would soup up Flutter’s efforts to conquer the US and could signal fresh consolidation in a sector that has already witnessed a succession of mergers.“This will enable Flutter to capitalise upon the relaxation of American laws on sports betting, which is now legal in 11 states, with seven more primed to announced a launch date,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell.“It will also enable the company to ersify further beyond the British and Australian markets, where it is the leader in online punting. Both arenas are relatively mature, tightly regulated and extremely competitive, even after a several rounds of consolidation in the industry.“The latest deal in the bookmaking and gambling business may also prompt speculation as to which firms will be next to acquire – and which firms will be their targets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f4ddf781cc3345d5e83385e018fe7fb547b915/0_101_3085_1851/master/3085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d271da1ac1764fcb836ca436ac7ab13","title":"rugby world cup 2019 new zealand v canada live","story":"New Zealand scored nine tries and came close to a few more in a vicious thwacking of an outclassed CanadaAnd with that, I’ll be off to to attack my lunch with the same kind of remorseless appetite with which the All Blacks just savaged Canada.

The brothers had already become the first trio of siblings to play for New Zealand at a World Cup, and they added another record by all scoring.Much more here:Mo’unga was deservedly named player of the match after an impeccable display.It was just something we’ve been looking forward to. To be able to come out and throw the ball around in such an awesome environment, the atmosphere’s outstanding, to play in a covered stadium meant the game could be a bit more expansive. It was a good time for us to try things, and experience a few new moves. It’s good to put these things into practice.Kieran Read has a chat in the stadium:It was bloody tough in this humidity under this roof, so it was a tough game. I thought we were all quite slippery, to be honest. It’s something to work on, and know you’re going to get those conditions right. I think we’re happy with the way we started both halves, but we also slipped off there at the ends of each half as well. Things to work on, but in these conditions its tricky.Those first 10 minutes after half-time were brutal. New Zealand didn’t drop the ball or miss a chance, and Canada were blown away. “What happened to the All Blacks at half time to inspire that whirlwind?” wonders Robin Hazlehurst. “Did Steve Hansen take their biscuits away? Warning to Canada, never ever let the All Blacks lose their biscuits.” If you’ve got no idea what he’s on about, watch this:82 mins: Phil Mack boots the ball into touch, and it’s all over!81 mins: The gong sounds, just as Jeff Hassler bursts into space! He passes to Nelson! Could they finally get their try? No! New Zealand break, and suddenly Beauden Barrett is running clear! He sprints towards the line, but three yards away the ball suddenly springs out of his hands like a crumpet from an overenthusiastic toaster!78 mins: A lovely chip from Beauden to Jordie Barrett sets New Zealand off again, but he doesn’t quite escape the Canada defence.76 mins: Um, not like that. Kieran Read gets a hand to their lineout, taps it back to a black shirt and New Zealand escape.76 mins: Canada have the ball inside New Zealand’s half. The crowd noise picks up. Can they get on the board tonight?73 mins: Oooof! Taylor Paris collides with Ardie Savea, head against head. The Canadian comes out of the collision worse, and is being treated. Savea, indeed, seems entirely untroubled.71 mins: Now Brad Weber fails to collect Ben Smith’s pass, when he was otherwise in for another try. I think Peter Nelson got his fingertips to it, a slight deflection that might have been decisive. 71 mins: Andrew Coe fails to collect Peter Nelson’s pass, and a promising spell of Canada possession is ended. Sam Whitelock, Codie Taylor and Savea all come on. 70 mins: Ardie Savea and his goggles are about to come on. But first, a scrum. 66 mins: Mo’unga, falling into the middle of a Conor Trainor-Jeff Hassler sandwich, fumbles his attempted pass to Ioane, who would otherwise have had a clear run to the line.66 mins: Phil Mack comes on for Gordon McRorie.64 mins: An air of near-sanity has settled over proceedings.61 mins: A couple of changes for Canada: Conor Keys off, Mike Sheppard on Daniel Van der Meuwe off, Taylor Paris on.59 mins: Mo’unga hasn’t put a foot, or indeed a hand, wrong all day, and that’s another cracker.57 mins: From a scrum Mo’unga confounds the Canadians by unexpectedly heading to his right, and then he offloads to Weber, bursting past, who sprints the last 40 yards to the line!54 mins: Canada haven’t conceded a try for over three minutes.50 mins: Stop this madness! The outstanding Richie Mo’unga completes an excellent pressured catch, Beauden Barrett slithers through a defence busily assuming the ball would continue its path from right to left, and he sprints away, draws the last defender and passes to Brad Weber!47 mins: What a start to the half from New Zealand! This is remorseless stuff. Canada perhaps overcommit at the maul, Ioane pushes forward and lays off to Frizzell, and it’s another one!45 mins: Richie Mo’unga breaks through Canada’s line and passes back to Kieran Read, and he gives it to Scott Barrett, who has the most straightforward of tasks.43 mins: A brilliant conversion from Mo’unga, whose kicking has been phenomenal.41 mins: A try within 45 seconds of the restart! It starts with Jordie Barrett brilliantly collecting Mo’unga’s kick, and from there they rip from right to left and Rieko Ione goes over!The players are back out, and ready for more. A change for each side: TJ Perenara is off and Brad Weber on, and Eric Howard is replaced by Howard Quattrin.For all that they lost out on a try because of a last-moment fumble, New Zealand’s handling has been very good. Indeed, the number of handling errors on both sides has been more than respectable, given that it’s so humid the players are essentially swimming.41 mins: McRorie blooters the ball into touch, and the players trot off for a well-earned breather.

As anyone who saw her Edinburgh fringe debut last year will know, Kate Berlant is the real deal – a sillyclever impro-comic majoring in how identity and ego are performed in the too-much-information age. And yet here she is arriving in London for a short standup run, to zero name recognition and minimal fanfare.That may change: after roles in Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 2018 hit Sorry to Bother You, she now has a TV sketch show in development with sidekick John Early. Telly connoisseurs will identify Early as a star of hipster comedy-thriller Search Party, in which Berlant also appeared. The duo have posted a series of hilarious videos online skewering – as Search Party did – the smart, shallow and self-absorbed millennial way of being. But their TV projects have yet to escape in-development gridlock, obliging Berlant’s genius to remain, for a little while longer, a secret shared by comedy lovers alone.But that’s fine by her, she tells me, on the phone from LA. (She’s a Santa Monica native.) “When I do a show and people turn up, that means more to me than anything,” says the 32-year-old. “Live performance is my favourite thing.” Pause. “That being said, please hire me for film or TV if there’s anyone reading this.”In the past, she’s been bullish in response to TV commissioners’ complaint that her and Early’s slippery brand of humour is too weird. “So we’re supposed to try to make something that appeals to everyone, and by doing so make something that appeals to no one? We firmly reject all of that.” Today, she doesn’t accept the premise. “I don’t think what I’m doing is niche. I can’t stop making faces or crossing my eyes. I’m embarrassingly lowbrow at times.” Earlier in her career, her ambition was to be the new Jim Carrey.The truth is that her comedy scrambles lowbrow and highbrow, as it does the distinction between the “real” Berlant and the character she may or may not be playing. On stage, she presents as a precious, preening comedian-cum-savant, hypersensitive to the atmosphere in the room and to every teensy indication of her own fabulousness. She barely seems to have any actual material, save for her stream-of-consciousness commentary on the gig and her experience of it. The vibe is: it’s our privilege to be in her presence – the more so when the show devolves into (of all things) a demonstration of her psychic powers.The clairvoyancy act, Berlant reports, is sometimes effective to a “spooky” degree: “I think there’s a connection between being psychic and improvising. They’re both about following intuition and not trying to overthink things.” But finally, it’s just a joke – and an excuse, she says, to be more herself onstage. Most comics, I venture, don’t need that much artifice just to reveal their own voice. But Berlant distrusts authenticity in comedy: “Performance is always not you, I would argue.” She will accept though that her stage persona is “an extrapolation of the most annoying parts of myself”, including “my boredom with the idea of the self-deprecating comedian. I’m more like: I very much want attention, that’s why I’m doing this. I just exaggerate how desperately I want to be seen.”Alongside that, she says, “I wanted to confuse my legibility onstage. Is it a character, or a real person? Why is the language I use falling apart?” Why indeed? Because it reflects “the post-internet language that derives from half-reading a million articles, from hearing opinions regurgitated in a couple of sentences. That fragmented access to information that we all have.” Berlant on stage is a “person cobbled together from internet fragments”. Wellness culture, corporate feminism, academic jargon: it’s all in there. “I’m playing a person so steeped in the cultural critiques that I’m obliterated. There’s so much commentary on myself that I cease to really exist.”You could blame her time at NYU, where she did a masters in the cultural anthropology of comedy, and acquired a fascination with “the performance of knowledge.” Or you could blame the fact that her dad is the artist Tony Berlant, renowned for his collages of found metal objects – which might just have inspired the provoking juxtapositions in his daughter’s comedy.But you’d have to admit that, just as it can be read through an art-intellectual lens, so Berlant’s comedy can simply be enjoyed for its ridiculousness and flamboyant liveness. “She’s so totally in the moment,” says her mentor Sarah Silverman. Berlant says: “I have tremendous respect for comics who have their 60-minute act scripted in advance. But for me, it feels dead if I don’t keep it open, and keep myself in a place of terror.”“Maybe that’s not wise for my mental state. But in performance, I just find it impossible to not acknowledge what’s actually going on in the moment.” At the core of her comedy – so self-aware, so aware of the contexts – is a hyper-awareness of “the essential weirdness of performance”, says Berlant, “the brutality of the expectation of doing comedy. And how inherently bizarre that encounter is.”• Kate Berlant is at Soho theatre, London, 7-12 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/494c1354a2018c60674e7d42f86c1d275858b7b4/1225_905_3121_1873/master/3121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34dc36fc378e8e373f6027a1af7fadd4","title":"royal shakespeare company to end bp sponsorship deal","story":"Theatre company’s move comes after growing criticism over its links with oil firmThe Royal Shakespeare Company is to end its sponsorship deal with BP amid growing opposition to big oil’s sponsorship of many of the UK’s leading cultural institutions.The RSC announced that after months of deliberations and a vociferous campaign from artists, the public and environmentalists, it had decided to curtail its eight-year relationship.The move will increase pressure on other cultural institutions such as the Royal Opera House, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery, which have all come under pressure over their tie-ins with fossil fuel companies.Jess Worth, the co-director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, said the decision was “fantastic news” that signalled the end of fossil fuel sponsorship of the arts.“The RSC has understood that a climate emergency means that business as usual cannot continue, and we congratulate them for showing leadership,” she added.In a joint statement, Gregory Doran, the RSC’s artistic director, and Catherine Mallyon, its executive director, said the decision had been taken after a “careful and often difficult debate” internally.They added: “Amidst the climate emergency, which we recognise, young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC. We cannot ignore that message.”The sponsorship deal will conclude at the end of this year – more than two years early.There has been growing criticism of fossil fuel corporations involvement in the arts over the past year as concern about the scale and severity of the climate crisis grows.In February, hundreds of people occupied the British Museum to object to its relationship with BP, and in June several leading artists wrote to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards calling on it to end its links to the company.Also in June, the  revealed that Mark Rylance, who had been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, was resigning from his position, arguing BP’s sponsorship deal allowed the company to “obscure the destructive reality of its activities”, which he said threatened the future of the planet.Last week, young people who had taken to the streets in huge numbers across the UK in the school climate strikes, said they would boycott the RSC unless it severed its ties with big oil.The RSC statement said the growing opposition from young people had been a critical factor in its decision.“Central to our organisational values, is that we listen to and respond to the views of young people. Each year we actively engage 500,000 children and young people with Shakespeare’s plays … It is with all of this in mind that we have taken the difficult decision to conclude our partnership with BP at the end of this year. There are many fine balances and complex issues involved and the decision has not been taken lightly or swiftly.”It thanked BP for its “generous support” since 2011, adding that the ticket scheme that the oil giant subsidised for 16- to 25-year-olds had allowed tens of thousands to young people to see world-class performances.In a statement BP said it was “disappointed and dismayed” by the decision.“We’re disappointed that this will bring a successful programme to a premature end. Over the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates.”It said it was dismayed because the oil giant shared “many of the concerns that apparently contributed to the decision”.In 2016 BP signed a new five-year sponsorship deal worth £7.5m with four leading UK institutions – the Royal Opera House, British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and Royal Shakespeare Company. This followed the £10m, five-year deal it had made with Tate, the British Museum, the NPG and the Royal Opera House in 2011.But campaigners said it was now time for all major cultural institutions to follow the RCS’s lead and cut their ties with fossil fuel companies.“There is no longer any excuse for promoting a fossil fuel company in the middle of a climate crisis,”said Worth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/729f8d0f71d8326c70178c345b1cbbdf825aa0da/0_121_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b38051c006035ef5b58d0e71c60cf34d","title":"no need to watch the apprentice we are living it now","story":"Aggressively awful people trying to force through their terrible ideas? There’s no hiding from it: our society has been hellishly Alan SugaredHere’s a fun quiz: who is your favourite Apprentice candidate this year? Is it Dean, the sports agent who brags about having “the gift of the gab”? Is it Bryonn, the recruitment consultant who calls himself the Tank because he “destroys problems on any terrain”? Or what about Sophie, the account manager who said: “If B is for business, then I’m queen of the hive”?Spoiler: it’s none of them. That’s partly because I made the last two up, and partly because nobody in their right mind is excited about The Apprentice any more.Sure, I’ve tutted at The Apprentice for having the temerity to still exist before. But this time I can feel it. There’s something in the air. The Apprentice is now fully out of puff.The new series – the 15th – starts tonight, farted out unheralded on to a schedule that deserves better. And unless things take a record-breakingly enormous turn, it’s going to be the least auspicious series yet.The reasons are easy to pinpoint. The show is long in the tooth, and has been for at least half a decade. This has had a clear knock-on effect on the quality of the contestants. Take the youngest member of this year’s intake. He is Ryan-Mark, a “luxury womenswear consultant” who cites the Queen as his role model and calls himself “the epitome of luxury”. Ryan-Mark is 19 years old. The Apprentice has been on since he was four. He has grown up with it. It has been part of the fabric of his life from the moment he gained the ability to make memories. He has seen how it is less a showcase for genuine business aptitude, and more a glorified fishbowl where the public gets to jeer at pillocks for an hour a week. He knows this, and he still signed up. I’ve never met Ryan-Mark, so this isn’t rooted in fact, but I suspect that – since he knowingly signed up for this, despite everything – he might be a nitwit. But the problems go so much deeper this year. There is Alan Sugar, who is starting to look like a honking great liability for the BBC. His Twitter feed is an absolute minefield that, when it isn’t just a random jumble of spaces, misspellings and errant punctuation, takes a hammer to the notion of impartiality. Just last week he reacted to Paula Sherriff’s emotional address in the House of Commons by calling her a “ranting woman” who reminded him of “an insane person”. In a week when Naga Munchetty has been hauled across the coals for correctly being able to identify racism, his lazy boorishness looks even more abject than usual. It is starting to look as if double standards might be at play, which is the last thing the corporation needs right now.Mainly, though, there is the gaping hole where public enthusiasm used to be. Usually, when the BBC tweets out the candidate profiles each year, it dominates the news for a day or two as fans play Top Trumps with their silly hair and awful personalities. This year, it didn’t muster even a peep. This might be down to timing, because it happened at the exact moment when Lady Hale was gracefully dismantling Boris Johnson’s plans, but there is a bigger reason for it too.What, really, is the point of The Apprentice in 2019? Is it for the bearbaiting spectacle of watching a load of big-tied dumbos trying to force through their terrible ideas with a truckload of unearned confidence? Because we’ve got BBC Parliament for that now. Is it to give airtime to some of the most aggressively awful people in the country? Because that is the role Question Time now serves. Is it so we can watch business after business crater in the face of incompetence? Because surely that’s why people voted for Brexit.The ugly, swaggering, craven ineptitude of The Apprentice feels totally redundant in 2019, because it has been absorbed into society. It is all around us, and there is no hiding place. We don’t need to watch The Apprentice any more. We’re living it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e15a57085062d6817a6fc656302d890a5d809b9/0_32_5945_3568/master/5945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb5ec0d270de9874e239205606f50c55","title":"132000 sephardic jews apply for spanish citizenship","story":"Application deadline passes under law designed to atone for 15th-century ‘historical wrong’More than 132,000 descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century have applied for Spanish citizenship under a law intended to make amends for the mass exile.The law, introduced four years ago, was designed to atone for the “historical wrong” that saw the country’s Jewish community expelled, forced to convert to Catholicism or burned at the stake.After being extended for a year, the law lapsed on 1 October. According to the justice ministry, 132,226 people of Sephardic descent applied for Spanish citizenship before the deadline, with a huge rise in applications in the past month.“By 31 August, 60,226 applications had been received, but in September alone, almost 72,000 were received, most of them from citizens in Latin American countries, mainly Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela,” the ministry said in a statement.The Spanish government had initially estimated that around 90,000 people would seek citizenship, but acknowledged that it was hard to know just how many people would meet the criteria.Spain’s Federation of Jewish Communities (FCJE), which certifies applications, said it had received more than 30,000 from Mexico, 26,000 from Colombia, 14,000 from Venezuela, 7,000 from Argentina, 5,400 from the US and 4,900 from Israel.It has also dealt with applications from Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Turkey, France, the UK, Serbia and Montenegro, Peru, Chile, Morocco and Afghanistan.Although the process does not require applicants to be practising Jews or to be resident in Spain, it is long, complicated and expensive.As well as taking tests in Spanish language and culture, applicants needed to prove their Sephardic heritage, establish or prove a special connection with Spain, and then pay a designated notary to certify their documents.Isaac Querub, the president of the FCJE, said the law had finally achieved its aims.“Thousands of Sephardic Jews from all over the world have recovered their Spanish nationality and thousands more are in the process of doing so,” he said.“Spain has used a long-lasting legal act to close a historical wound. Sephardic Jews are no longer ‘the Jews without a homeland’. Spain came to miss them and the Sephardic Jews never forgot Spain.”A similar law was approved in Portugal in 2015 to atone for the expulsions from that part of the Iberian peninsula.“There is no possibility to amend what was done,” the Portuguese government said at the time, adding that the law represented “an attribution of a right”.Brexit has fuelled a huge increase in the number of applications for Portuguese citizenship.The Jewish Community of Oporto – which, along with the Lisbon Jewish community, certifies applicants – said it had received just five applications before the Brexit referendum compared with 400 in the two months following the vote.The Jewish Federation of New Mexico also recorded a spike in applications following the election of Donald Trump as president.“Before the election, we issued maybe 20 or 30 certificates,” Sara Koplik, the federation’s director of community outreach, told the  last year.“But we have now issued 1,500 – from multiple countries.”While the federation has dealt with applications from more than 50 countries, the majority come from the US, Mexico and Venezuela.“It’s a big jump and of course some of it had nothing to do with the United States – it has to do with Venezuela and violence in Mexico – but for Americans, they see this as an insurance policy just in case, against hatred,” said Koplik."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cea6466227af4aa426134699b09c104e2b31dfb/0_422_2832_1698/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f640420dfe10d20b82e72f820d4cd03f","title":"comic joins germanys oldest political party with eye on leadership","story":"Jan Böhmermann says he will be ready by next contest to lead Social Democratic party – which he predicts will soonGermany’s leading television satirist has joined the Social Democratic party, weeks after announcing his ambitions to become its leader.Jan Böhmermann, who has a weekly programme on state television and is notorious for sparking diplomatic scandals, has missed the deadline for the current leadership contest, expected to conclude on 8 December.But he has predicted that the troubled party, the oldest in Germany, but which is struggling for survival after 156 years of existence, will be in need of a new leader by next spring, and he has said he would be prepared to throw his hat into the ring.The biggest problem for the party is how seriously it should take the award-winning, 38-year-old, comic, famous for sending up everything he sees as worthy of satire.His past exploits, aired on his weekly programme Neo Magazin Royale, which have been reported around the world, include a video about Yanis Varoufakis, Greek finance minister at one time, in which he appeared to give Germany the middle finger, and a poem ridiculing the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for which the comic was prosecuted and subsequently given police protection.Lars Klingbeil, the SPD’s general secretary, welcomed the millionaire TV star to the party.“Welcome in the SPD, dear comrade @janboehm,” Klingbeil wrote on Twitter. But he also reminded Böhmermann of the menial but necessary tasks that came with membership and which would be expected of him, such as campaigning, door-knocking, talking to voters and putting up posters. “We’re looking forward very much to the fact that you’ll now be by our side fighting for a strong social democracy.”There are inevitably fears within the party that this is another one of Böhmermann’s “gags” and that its decision to let him in could backfire.A glimpse at his leadership bid speech, launched under the hashtag slogan #Neustart19 (new start ‘19), “dare to be more democratic” – suggests they are right to be wary. In it he refers to social democracy as “Germany’s Amazon” which could ill afford to decline outside help. “We need to save the red lung of Germany, whether it likes it or not,” he said.Böhmermann boasts that he has three times as many Twitter followers as the rest of the party leadership put together. He says his biggest problem is not having a female partner to stand alongside him for the co-leadership, and appeals for candidates to come forward. He says there are plenty of other examples of television personalities entering politics, most notably Steffen Seibert (spokesman of Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor), who was previously a prominent news anchor.There are also examples of comics who have realised their political ambitions, such as Beppe Grillo of the populist 5 Star Movement in Italy, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky. In the US, Donald Trump was a reality TV star before becoming president.Ronald Mormann, chair of the district chapter in Saxony-Anhalt, which finally agreed to accept Böhmermann’s membership after weeks of internal debate, said the party was prepared forgive him for his previous acidic criticisms of it.“But satire can get away with a lot, and Germany’s oldest party is capable of enduring a lot. German social democracy has fought for 156 years for people to be able to express their opinions openly,” Mormann said. He also reminded Böhmermann: “We are a party, and not a satirical performance.”Böhmermann has said he will follow December’s leadership contest closely, but predicted it would not go well. “I estimate that by the spring of 2020 the SPD will already be looking for a new leader, and my team and I will then be even better prepared ... then it will work out,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f40b32827cd295918f9ce142f232f6f189af38d0/0_188_5632_3379/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f603d784a743613145deb2ec845bc554","title":"hurricane lorenzo ireland braces itself for powerful storm","story":"Damage expected from the largest recorded storm to make it so far east in north AtlanticIreland is bracing for strong winds, downed power lines and coastal flooding when Storm Lorenzo barrels in from the Atlantic before hitting Britain.Met Éireann, the national meteorological service, issued a status orange wind warning on Wednesday for six counties on the west coast and a yellow warning nationwide for Thursday night and Friday morning.“The main impacts will include disruptive winds, falling trees and flooding,” it said. “Storm Lorenzo will produce significant swell, high waves and sizeable storm surges. This will lead to wave overtopping, some coastal flooding and damage, especially along western and southern coasts.”Lorenzo is the largest recorded storm to have made it so far east in the north Atlantic.Authorities on Portugal’s Azores islands closed roads, schools and non-emergency public services on Wednesday morning in preparation for winds of up to 100mph (161kmh) and waves of up to 25 metres (82ft).“The situation will worsen in the next few hours,” the head of the regional government, Vasco Cordeiro, told the Portuguese broadcaster SIC.Lorenzo is expected to weaken to an extratropical storm as it moves north towards Ireland and the UK.At a meeting of Ireland’s National Emergency Co-ordination Group, Eoghan Harris, the housing and planning minister, expressed concern over the storm’s potential impact in coastal areas and the damage from falling trees.The orange warning for Galway, Mayo, Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick will be in place from 6pm on Thursday to 3am on Friday. South-westerly winds will reach mean speeds 40 to 50mph, with gusts of 60 to 80mph. A yellow rainfall warning for Ireland will be in place between 9am on Thursday and 9am on Friday.Dan Suri, the chief meteorologist at the UK’s Met Office, said rain and heavy winds would hit western parts of the UK from Thursday, with a risk of coastal gales in Northern Ireland and western Scotland on Thursday, and Wales and south-west England on Friday.In Ireland, a status red warning is the strongest alert, while orange is for conditions that can “impact significantly” on people in affected areas. Yellow is for conditions that do pose threats “only to those exposed to risk by nature of their location andor activity”.Hurricane Lorenzo broke records over the weekend after being elevated to a category 5 storm, which the National Hurricane Center in the US said was the strongest for that far north and east in the Atlantic."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4037701.1570023358!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"trinity college seeks female nominees to join collection of 40 male busts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  Long Room library in Trinity College Dublin.  Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe . Trinity College Dublin’s Long Room is famous around the world for its stunning collection of rare library books.The fact that all of the 40 marble sculptures which line the main chamber of the Old Library are men is a less celebrated fact.Finally, after almost 300 years, this is about to change. Trinity provost Patrick Prendergast has called on staff and students to nominate the first female scholar to be memorialised in a bust which will sit alongside the men. In an email to students and staff, he said it was time to make Trinity’s public spaces “more representative of our ersity”.Mr Prendergast said nominations will be considered by a committee chaired by himself and other members of the college community.The commissioning of the new sculpture will follow the same criteria for previous busts: the subject must have been a scholar, although not necessarily at Trinity, and be deceased. Prominent scholarsThe collection began in 1743 when the university commissioned a series of busts of prominent scholars from the sculptor Peter Scheemakers. Today, the busts in the Long Room include writers and philosophers such as Edmund Burke, Aristotle, Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare and Jonathan Swift. There are also less well-known sculptures of former Trinity alumni including Irish lawyer and judge Charles Kendal Bushe, Protestant bishop Robert Clayton and librarian John Adam Malet. The university is seeking nominations running to less than 300 words, which include the reasons for the nomination as well as links to information relevant to the nomination. The deadline is December 1st.The Long Room itself dates back to the 1730s. It originally had a flat plaster ceiling and shelving for books was on the lower level only, with an open gallery.By the 1850s, these shelves had become full and a few years later the roof was raised to allow construction of the present barrel-vaulted ceiling and upper gallery bookcases. The move to make Trinity a legal deposit library in 1801 led to a surge in the number of books that needed to be accommodated. Under legislation, publishers in the UK and Ireland are required to send a copy of any newly published book to Trinity."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson tells Tory conference \u0026#39Let\u0026#39s get Brexit done and bring this country together\u0026#39\u0026#39I\u0026#39m truly the reflection of perfection\u0026#39: the daftest Apprentice candidates of all timeApprentice winners and candidates: what happened next?Revealed: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit deal letters to the EUComment: Boris Johnson brought the house down with a speech that was pure Tommy CooperPeter Sissons dies: Former BBC newsreader and Question Time presenter passes away aged 77 Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Conservative Party conference speech, in fullAnalysis: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s first conference speech as Prime Minister was long on rhetoric but short on policy NHS cardiologist cleared of misconduct for \u0026#39causing girlfriend\u0026#39s skin cancer by giving her sleeping pills\u0026#39 Comment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s bold plan to bin the backstop will be doomed without a domestic mandate\u0026#39It\u0026#39s Boris vs the Surrender Act - there is going to be a proper showdown\u0026#39 -  readers react to PM\u0026#39s Brexit planComment: Good-humoured Boris just gave us the best speech of his career\tFrench police stage massive \u0026#39anger march\u0026#39 over working conditions, low morale and suicidesRoyal Shakespeare Company ends partnership with BP over concerns about climate Benjamin Netanyahu\u0026#39s long-awaited corruption hearing opens in JerusalemSouth Korean woman commits suicide after doctor filmed her using spycam, reports sayComment: What the Conservative Party Conference lacked in MPs it made up for in defiant unity\tArlene Foster hints the DUP may back Boris Johnson\u0026#39s plans, saying it\u0026#39s time to \u0026#39get a deal now\u0026#39Brexit proposal falls on stony ground as Dublin braces for no dealWoman climbs into New York zoo exhibit and dances in front of lionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000208948867_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"doctors have announced first case brexit triggered psychosis","story":"Patient EU has been so affected by the referendum result that he hWhat to make of the first reported case of Brexit-triggered psychosis?

But a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often, are more substantive and less dramatic,” he said.\u0026nbsp“And those meetings aren’t being played for the camera, but that’s where a lot of the discussions and details get hashed out on things.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We worked closely with the Deaf community to develop a feature that would improve access to digital media.Speaking on stage at Google IO, CEO Sundar Pichai said: You can imagine all the use cases for the broader community too.

And then it helped him rebuild his image after murder of Jamal Khashoggi, reports Richard HallThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi was supposed to be quiet. The Saudi officials behind the brutal slaying had planned everything meticulously. He would disappear without a trace.\u0026nbspThe killers wanted nothing to disturb their boss’s ambitious reform drive at home. The young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was trying to transform his country. He had spent the past two years courting the international community as part of his grand vision to modernise the Kingdom and attract foreign investment. He gave Saudis new freedoms, but he also cracked down harder than ever on dissent.\u0026nbspHundreds of millions of dollars were spent on promoting Bin Salman and his reforms. A vast global public relations offensive courted world leaders and celebrities.\u0026nbspAnd it appeared to be working – up until Khashoggi disappeared. When it emerged that the dissident journalist had been murdered inside the Saudi consulate, likely on behalf of the crown prince, that carefully crafted image was ruined, and Bin Salman found himself in the centre of a global scandal that threatened to derail all of his plans.This army of public relations firms were now faced with an impossible task: to save the image of a man whom many now regarded as a brutal murderer. One year on from Khashoggi’s killing, they may just have done it. \u0026nbspThe fallout from the Khashoggi killing was unexpected, but Bin Salman’s vast PR network was already on a war footing when the scandal broke.\u0026nbspA year earlier, the Saudi information ministry announced a global campaign “to promote the changing face of KSA to the rest of the world”. This network of lobbyists and public relations experts had been working furiously to counter bad press from Saudi Arabia’s devastating war in Yemen and its blockade of Qatar. Most of it, however, was working to promote MBS.\u0026nbspIn early 2018, the crown prince embarked on a high profile media tour of the US – billed as a coming out party after assuming de-facto leadership of Saudi Arabia from his father. He held meetings with President Donald Trump, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, Hollywood stars, Wall Street financiers and Oprah Winfrey, to name a few. He appeared on the flagship news programme 60 Minutes\u0026nbspfor a sitdown interview, and attracted faint praise from columnists in the New York Times.\u0026nbspThat trip was followed by a similarly loud visit to London. PR agencies took out full page adverts in national newspapers, and paid for giant billboards across the city announcing the visit. Industry insiders said that campaign could have cost as much as £1 million.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn 2018, Saudi Arabia spent more than $34 million (£27m) on lobbying in the US alone, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The kingdom also hired a host of London firms, including Consulum, largely staffed by former employees of Bell Pottinger, and Freud’s.\u0026nbspThe aim was “to present an image of KSA as striding towards reform, detoxify the government to reduce international political pressure, attract investment for economic growth, and open up foreign tourism,” says Professor Hardy.\u0026nbspBut not everyone was convinced. Many saw the PR push as just that, including Khashoggi himself. Nikita Bernardi, a PR consultant who works on human rights cases in the Middle East, remembers discussing the prince’s plans with Khashoggi. \u0026nbsp“He and I were having this conversation in the days before his killing,” she says. “Almost exactly a year ago I was in Washington DC organising a conference, the aim of which was to question this new face of Saudi Arabia they were trying to promote. Jamal Khashoggi was one of the speakers.”“The PR campaign felt so extremely superficial. It was almost designed for Western countries that needed him to look more palatable so that they can continue the status quo and sell arms and the rest of it. They needed him to look like he was changing things in the right direction.”\u0026nbspJamal Khashoggi during a press conference on 15 December 2014. Saudi Arabian officials murdered Khashoggi, a dissident and journalist (AFP)At the very moment Khashoggi was airing his doubts about whether the crown prince was really a true reformer\u0026nbsp– in private and in public – Bin Salman’s top advisors were plotting to kill him.Khashoggi went missing on 2 October after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He had gone there to collect papers so that he could marry his fiancee, who waited for him outside. He was never seen again.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia initially insisted that Khashoggi had left the consulate, but after a steady stream of leaks by Turkish investigators, it changed the story, saying the 59-year-old was killed there in a “fist fight”.Turkish and international investigators later said that Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate and his body disposed of. Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur leading an independent human rights inquiry into the killing, said the murder was “planned and perpetrated by Saudi officials”.\u0026nbspBut the trail of evidence led all the way to Bin Salman himself. The CIA and some western countries believe the crown prince ordered the killing – something he has continued to deny.\u0026nbspIn trying to silence Khashoggi, his murderers had the opposite effect. The journalist’s disappearance sparked a firestorm that engulfed the crown prince. Donald Trump, who had been close to Bin Salman, described the attempts to deny the killing as the worst in the history of cover-ups.MBS speaks about his role in the murder of Jamal KhashoggiThe murder derailed the crown prince’s carefully crafted rebrand. In the weeks that followed, as the crown prince was directly accused of involvement, a number of companies and leaders distanced themselves from the kingdom. London-based Freud’s and Pagefield Global Counsel announced they were no longer working with the country, in addition to Milltown Partners, which was run by a former head of communications for Prince Charles.PR Week reported that Gladstone Place Partners, Glover Park Group, BGR, Portland Communications, and Gibson, Dunn \u0026amp Crutcher all ended their work for the Saudi government.But though the kingdom lost much of its PR strength, the firms that stuck around “went into overdrive,” Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence for the Center for International Policy, told the Washington Post.\u0026nbspThose firms included Qorvis Communications, a US-based crisis communications company, and its parent company, MSL, which has worked with the Saudi government for nearly two decades. According to the Washington Post, MSL has received more than $18 million from the Saudi government since October 2018.\u0026nbspThe Saudi government also signed a new $120,000-a-month contract with Karv Communications earlier this year, according to the Financial Times, to “enhance the reputation and image” of the country’s Public Investment Fund, which is headed by Bin Salman.With the crown prince under suspicion for the killing, the strategy of the PR firms changed, according to Professor Hardy. The incessant focus on MBS was replaced by more targeted persuasion.“The Saudi government sent out senior envoys to persuade key figures in media, politics and business of the sincerity of the investigation into the killing, and slow, discrete work to stabilise and rebuild confidence,” he says. \u0026nbsp“We are currently seeing a multi-pronged effort. KSA is investing in ‘soft power’ influence such as sports and tourism. Efforts to influence wider public perceptions through such things as sports investment have led to the charge of sportswashing,” he says.\u0026nbspProfessor Hardy points to the upcoming boxing rematch between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz for the world heavyweight title that will be held in the kingdom.\u0026nbspSalman (C) with blood on his hands protests outside the Saudi Embassy in Washington, DC, on October 8, 2018, demanding justice for Jamal Khashoggi (JIM WATSONAFPGetty Images)On Friday, just days ahead of the anniversary of Khashoggi’s killing, the government announced a new tourist visa programme for 49 countries.\u0026nbspAnd yet, one year after Khashoggi’s murder, the crown prince is making a return to the spotlight. On Saturday, Bin Salman appeared on 60 Minutes again. In the interview, he denied any personal involvement in the killing.\u0026nbspThis was a heinous crime, he said. But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by iniduals working for the Saudi government.\u0026nbspI get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch, he said.\u0026nbspBernardi, the PR consultant, says the interview marks a new strategy.\u0026nbsp“There is only so much that could have been done to protect his reputation. The damage was so great. In the whole year since Jamal has died you can see how the Saudi story has changed. First it was deny deny deny, then they said it was rogue agents, now we have the crown prince saying ‘it happened under my watch’.”That is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It’s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing\u0026nbsp“That is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It’s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing.”\u0026nbspAgnes Callamard, the UN’s expert on summary executions whose investigation found “credible evidence” linking the crown prince to the murder, told Reuters that his remarks amount to a strategy of rehabilitation in the face of public outrage around the world.He is creating a distance between himself, he is exonerating himself from direct criminal responsibility in the killing.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They could end up re-shaping the political landscape of this country forever.The Supreme Court’s outlawing of a political decision and the coward Corbyn’s refusal to trigger a general election have created a dangerous Commons stalemate.At the same time voters are powerless as political conventions which are the backbone of our democracy are reshaped before their eyes.Tuesday’s court judgement overruling Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament will have a chilling effect on decision-making at the heart of government.How many future kne-edge rulings made by a PM against the clock could now be quashed by the court What about the signing of treaties  Or the appointment of ministers How about choosing to take military action in retaliation for an attack on Britain You can bet Vladimir Putin is lapping up the prospect of a British Prime Minister having to go cap in hand to a  of judges to askhe can hit back.The Supreme Court has potentially paved the way to a new era of rule by a group of unelected entities. Meanwhile, the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition has shown once again that he has the spine of a jellyfish.Jeremy Corbyn’s actions are those of a man who is scared to face the voters, scared of his own Labour MPs and scared of even being PM.Together with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson he is intent on driving Britain away from the Brexit a majority voted for and into a rigged referendum which nobody deserves.They are also forcing us away from the general election which the country is crying out for and into another EU extension which will only prolong our agony.This week the SNP are leading a plot to ambush Boris with a vote of no confidence while he prepares to address the Tory conference.Perhaps they should consider how Scottish voters would feelthey had won an independence vote only to find it hadn’t been implemented three years later.Our shambling farce has gone on too long.But as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox says even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.Britain’s voters will get their say eventually.At that moment they will decide one of two very clear futures for this country.Either a resumption of the democratic traditions and institutions at the heart of our society under Boris Johnson.Or a disunited kingdom, riven by the elite interests of lawyers and rival factions, carving up our political landscape between them.It would mean goodbye to the Britain we treasure as a beacon of democracy.And herald the dawn of a chaotic virtual republic under complete enslavement to Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Around  years ago, as co-presenter of BBC’s live TV show Crimewatch Daily, I interviewed a man called Mick North.Mr North was a lecturer in biochemistry at Stirling University in Scotland and, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, his we Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer and died just two and a half years later – leaving him with a toddler to bring up alone.On March , , he dropped Sophie – by then aged five – at school and headed off to work.The school was Dunblane Primary and she was shot dead by social misfit Thomas Hamilton who, armed with the four guns and  cartridges he owned legally, massacred  pupils and one teacher.In , after writing a book about the tragedy, Mr North came on the show to tell his heart-breaking story and to explain why, in , he had joined the Gun Control Network to campaign for tighter vetting.Sympathising with a man who had lost his daughter in such unconscionable circumstances, I simply said something along the lines of, “I’m not surprised” – a comment seized upon as “partisan” by the gun lobby, who then bombarded the BBC with complaints.The next day I was forced to apologise on air.Yes, it’s important that those presenting on the BBC are seen to be impartial when discussing politics but, be it Naga, citing her own experiences of racism or, in my case, sympathising with a man asking for tighter gun laws after his young daughter was shot dead, these are human reactions that should be judged using common sense, not boiler-plate rules.IN Debbie Harry’s compelling memoir, Face It, she writes about the time David Bowie was backstage with her and rock star Iggy Pop.She says: “David pulled out his c*ck – asI were the official c*ck checker or something.“He loved to pull it out, with both men and women. It was so funny, adorable and sexy.”BRITISH passengers on a luxury cruise to Monte Carlo ended up kipping on camp beds in a sports hall after rough weather meant they couldn’tto their ship.One of the “angry and upset” guests said: “It was horrendous. It spoilt our holiday.”But she added that their day in glitzy Monte Carlo had been brilliant, saying: “It was great to see how the other half live.”I’m not saying that passengers shouldn’t be compensated for their unscheduled night off the boat.But perhaps they should view their stay in the hall from the perspective of how another half live – namely the , homeless in the UK.One of them, -year-old David Bateman, was jailed for more than three years this week after using a craft kne to rob a Sainsbury’s store in Exeter then waiting outside until the police arrived.Why  Because he was so desperate for food and a bed that he wanted to go to prison.And as The Sun highlighted this week, around , of the homeless are ex-military being failed by councils when they ask for housing support.A camp bed in a warm hall would be luxury to them.On December , I will be taking part in The World’s Big Sleepout, which aims to raise funds for the homeless.If you would like to donate, or even take part, then details are on bigsleepout.With winter coming, we should each try to do something – however small – to help those less fortunate.COUNTRYFILE viewers have questioned why a special episode was called One Man And His Dog when three out of the four handlers were female.And let’s face it, it’s not very inclusive of our female pooches, either.Though One Handler And Their Bitch is perhaps a little too modern, even for . BORIS JOHNSON has shocked onlookers by practising his “signature move” of the double thigh-squeeze, in broad daylight.“First of all he reportedly squeezed the thighs of two women either side of him at a dinner party  years ago – and now here he is blatantly proving that it is indeed ‘a signature move’.WHEN pub landlord Nigel Smith learned that no babies born in  were given his Christian name, he decided to host a party for his namesakes.More than  of them turned up to The Fleece Inn, in Bretforton, Worcs.Last weekend, I went on an old-haunts pub crawl in the city of Worcester with four of my closest schoolmates – Wendy, Sue, Sonia and Carolyn.All names that, along with Jane, Jackie, Julie, Sandra, Ian, Gary, Geoff, Nigel and many other rapidly declining monikers, firmly date us as children of the Sixties.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The kind of very emotional, anti-press tirade... you dont expect it from a member of the Royal Family.I dont think this is the real Harry, I think he is being goaded into this by Meghan, who wants to be seeing only good press about herself. Its not the way it works.He doesnt want freedom of the press. He wants the press to be what he wants it to be.After being criticised by viewers on Twitter this morning, Morgan responded that he had lost his own father as a child.Harry released the explosive statement on the couples personal website last night.He said: I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.“I lost my mother and now I watch my we falling victim to the same powerful forces.”Harry said he and Meghan believed in “media freedom and objective, truthful reporting” as a “cornerstone of democracy”.But he added: “Unfortunately, my we has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequences - a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.“There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specically when it is knowingly  and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face - as so many of you can relate to - I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.“Because in today’s digital age, press fabrications are repurposed as truth across the globe. One day’s coverage is no longer tomorrow’s chip-paper.”Harry, who is represented by high-powered London legal firm Harbottle  Lewis who have made several complaints to newspapers on his behalf, also claimed the couple had been unable to correct “continual misrepresentations” in the press.He also even questioned the positive newspaper coverage the couple have enjoyed during their current Southern African tour.The Duke and Duchess have been pictured every day since last week attending a series of events to highlight good causes close to their hearts.Each visit has been crafted by a team of public relations experts to help improve their image.That included Harry’s visit to land mine fields in Angola - just like Diana did in the s and a rare public appearance by their baby son Archie.But the Prince claimed this “positive” coverage of himself and Meghan on the tour exposed “the double standards” of the press.He added: “She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you’ve seen on this Africa tour.“I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.”Meghan started the costly legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it “unlawfully” published a letter from her to her father Thomas Markle earlier this year.The Duchess insists the letter - which detailed her pain at their estrangement since the Wedding - was private.Law firm Schillings, representing the Duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .The legal proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court are being privately funded by Harry and Meghan.Depending on the court ruling, proceeds from any damages will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.“The positive coverage of this last week in Africa is richly deserved. This feels to me like an over-emotional and somewhat ill- advised outburst.”A Mail on Sunday spokesman said: The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.Specically, we categorically deny that the Duchess’s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.We pay for your stories!

I think part of the group discussion that we had earlier is what is offsetting CO.The Duchess of Sussex has revealed the schedule for her first trip to South Africa was based around a special person in her le – baby son Archies feeding times.In an interview given on the penultimate day of Meghan and Harrys visit to southern Africa, the duchess also said she missed her husband so much while he was away on a solo tour of the region.She described being in South Africa for the first time as a really powerful experience.And speaking about her formal role with the Commonwealth family, she said the  that came with the position was something she took incredibly seriously.Quizzed about how the trip has been as a family, Meghan replied: On my goodness, well, were doing well.I think the schedule – they have been very kind to me, because everything is based around Archies feed times.So its a full plate, but were making it work. Its worth it.The couple have spent the past nine days visiting southern Africa and raising issues they are passionate about including wildle conservation and female empowerment.Last night Harry revealed his we Meghan has launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday.In a y statement published on the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs website, Harry alleged the paper had unlawfully published a letter from her to her father Thomas Markle.Meghan Markle insists the letter - which detailed her pain at their estrangement since the Royal Wedding - was private.In a statement revealing the legal action, Prince Harry claimed the couple were suffering from the painful impact of relentless propaganda against Meghan.But royal commentators questioned his comments.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t. They settled instead on Japan With Sue Perkins, who went “in search of the country’s soul” by dressing up as a few cultural stereotypes and probably sending children to bed with nightmares in her geisha girl outfit.If WE did that, of course, “cultural appropriation” would be the least of the accusations made against us.

Forcing them to carry crack cocaine and heroin across rural and coastal communities.“Threatening them into carrying guns and knives as ‘protection’. Manipulating them into killing innocent people.“Faced with this new and growing danger, our police will know that I will back them to get this under control.And today I am announcing a £ million package to roll up county lines drugs gangs.To stop them terrorising our towns and villages and exploiting our children.“And a new £ million Safer Streets fund for new security measures for Britain’s worst crime spots.“And as well as giving the police the kit and powers they need, we must do more to recognise their commitment, their bravery, and their professionalism.Ms Patel also used her speech to take a swipe at Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn and shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott.She claimed Labour would see Britain’s streets less safe and accused Labour of “trusting our foes rather than our friends”.The Home Secretary said: “Of course, there will be only two dissenting voices.“Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.“Because the choice isn’t just who the people want to be our next Prime Minister.“It’s also about who the people want to be their next Home Secretary.“Do we really want a Labour Home Secretary who would leave our communities and our country less safe “A Labour Party who won’t even attempt to take back control of our borders.“Because they want to surrender our border control and extend free movement.“And on policing The Labour Party would stop the police from doing their job.“And when it comes to our brilliant intelligence agencies, well – what can I say “The Labour Party trust our foes more than our friends.”Ms Patels speech comes after Justice Secretary Robert Buckland unveiled plans to axe automatic early release for serious violent criminals and sexual offenders.Instead of being let out half way through their sentence, they will now have to spend at least two-thirds of their term behind bars.It means rapists will face up to two more years in jail.Mr Buckland said: “We owe it to the victims.”The pledge is the latest bid to toughen up the Tories’ reputation on law and order following a blood curdling surge in kne attacks.Boris Johnson has vowed to hire , more police officers and rip up sentencing rules to ensure child killers get “le” terms.Currently, almost all serious violent and sexual offenders are automatically released half way through their prison term under changes brought in by Labour in .The new proposals mean a rapist sentenced to  years will have to serve . years instead of .It wouldn’t cover murder as killers have to serve their whole tarf before going in front of the Parole Board."},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit uk eu","story":"This is a major blow to Boris Johnson who had insisted Britain would leave the EU on Halloween no s, no buts.A No Deal departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship or any transition period.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Mr Johnson had insisted Britain would leave the EU on October  do or die - and was prepared to lave with no deal.He said he would rather be dead in a ditch than ask the EU for another Brexit extension.However a proposed law blocking a No Deal Brexit was backed by MPs on September  and was passed in the Lords on September .It will become law within days once it gets the formality of royal assent.In a bid to scupper the legislation, Mr Johnson is calling for a General Election - a move that has so far been resisted by Labour.The parties have been mulling whether to agree to a mid-October election, which can only be triggeredtwo-thirds of MPs agree.Mr Johnson says an election is the only way to break the Brexit impasse.But opponents dont want to agree unless they can ensure the PM cant take Britain out of the EU on October  without a orce agreement, as he has threatened to do.Mr Johnson said at the launch of his campaign that he was not aiming for a No Deal outcome for Brexit but the threat of no deal was a vital negotiation tool.He insisted the UK must do better than the deal served up by EU bosses.If opposition MPs refuse to back any Government moves to force an election, Mr Johnson may make the extraordinary decision to trigger a confidence motion in his own administration.He would effectively be daring opposition politicians to back him, and hoping that no other potential governments emerged which could command a majority in the Commons - running the risk of a caretaker government taking power.If a new government cannot be formed within  days, Parliament would be dissolved and an early general election triggered.The Prime Minister effectively threw down an ultimatum to the EU members during his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.He told the Tory faithful that Brussels had to accept his deal proposal over leaving the bloc or face a no deal scenario in days.Mr Johnson said we can, we must and we will be out of the EU on October .The Prime Minister said: Let’s get it done because delay is so pointless and expensive.After  years of really dramatic constitutional change we must have a new relationship with the EU.What Leavers want, what Remainers want, what the whole world wants – is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject, and to move on.And that is why we are coming out of the EU on October , come what may...We are here to serve the democratic will of the British people.He hopes the new proposals - which will be delivered in full to EU capitals later today - will secure Britain a deal within just  days.The new plan hinges on a bold shake-up of the withdrawal agreement to move towards two ‘soft’ borders in Ireland - which would finally allow the UK to strike its own trade deals around the world.To avoid a No Deal Brexit, the UK government would have to pass a Brexit orce plan into law, obtain another extension from the EU, or cancel Brexit.Under a No Deal scenario, Britain will crash out of the EU with no transition period to ensure a smooth crossover.The  mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard borderno other arrangement is made - which could be catastrophic for the region.The UK will immediately have to leave EU institutions including the European Court of Justice and Europol.Businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The UK will no longer contribute to the EU budget - currently about £billion a year.Under a No Deal, there would be no time to bring in a UK-EU trade deal.Instead, trade would initially have to be on terms set by the World Trade Organisation.This means tarfs will apply to most goods UK business send to the EU, which could make those goods less competitive.Boris Johnson has has insisted he wont ask the EU to delay Brexit again - evenhe is required to do so by law.The Benn bill has been presented by Labour MP Hilary Benn, and has been signed by opposition leaders and recently-sacked Conservatives, including Alistair Burt and Philip Hammond.It requires the Government to either reach a deal - or gain Parliaments approval for a no-deal Brexit by October .Johnson announced an extra £.billion of funding to prepare for a No Deal, which is doubling the amount of money set aside this year.Ministers had previously announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with this scenario.They had already unveiled the post-Brexit immigration system, which will end preferential treatment for EU migrants.Mr Johnson has tasked Michael Gove with preparing for a No Deal Brexit.He also assured the .million EU nationals living in Britain that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights to live and remain.The government is expected to be defeated later today when it asks MPs again to agree to a snap election.Meanwhile legislation aimed at preventing a No Deal Brexit is expected to receive Royal Assent today.The Government has launched a “Get Ready for Brexit” campaign to keep the public informed.The official Get Ready For Brexit portal has a questionnaire for iniduals or businesses to find out how they could be affected.The checklist allows users to say whether they propose to travel to the EU, export to Europe orthey are a British national living in the EU.Some of the advice on the site includes warning that those wishing to travel with pets may not be able to take their animals abroad until .These people are being advised to contact their vet at least four months before travelling to have all the necessary paperwork.People are also encouraged to check for disruption before travelling to the EU after October, as border checks may take longer.The site also advises people to renew their passports as soon as possible.Those using mobile phones in the EU are warned they may be charged for using your mobile device in the EUyour operator has re-introduced roaming charges.Businesses can also find out on the site what paperwork they may have to fill in to import or export goods to the EU after Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"burglary gang member poses on bed 50 notes 400 homes","story":"Brazen Florina Spiru – who laundered money for the multi-million pound mob – is pictured flaunting cash as she sprawls across a bed completely covered in nicked bank notes.The snap was released by cops today after Spiru, , and her Romanian gang were caged for more than  years for raids on hundreds of homes.Her husband and ringleader Catalin Zaharia and Constantin Stoian, both , Marian Molocia, , Daniel Stoean, , targeted properties in affluent areas on the hunt for cash and jewellery.Photographs uncovered by detectives on the thieves’ phones also showed them with a flash BMW MS Sport and and piles of plundered jewellery.The “ruthlessly organised” outfit scoped out homes in well-off areas before waiting until after dark to pounce, often going to extraordinary measures including using bedsheets to scale one property.CCTV from West Midlands Police shows head of the gang Zaharia clambering up a sheet thrown by Molocia from a first floor window of a home in Castle Bromwich.Its believed they struck at hundreds of homes between  and December , , when West Midlands Police swooped in to arrest the gang at a pad in Oldbury.Today, at Birmingham Crown Court, the gang were jailed for a total of  years and four months.Judge Laurence Creed QC sentenced Zaharia to eight years in jail, Mulochia to six years and four months, Stoean to four years, Stoian to four-and-a-half years and Spiru to four-and-a-half-years.Spiru was not actively involved in the break-ins but instead acted as group admin and helped launder their ill-gotten gains. The rest admitted conspiracy to burgle.She was found guilty of money laundering after a trial but cleared of the burglary charge.Asian gold jewellery, designer clothes and watches were all swiped in the raids then taken back to Romania, where the crooks enjoyed the trappings of their criminal enterprise.Other property was stored at an address in Oldbury - described as an Aladdins cave of stolen goods.One victim whose home was attacked and Christmas presents stolen told the court: Since the break-in of our property our children have been devastated.Their home should have been their safe haven. I had jewellery given to me from grandparents which can never be replaced. They ransacked my bedroom and my childrens bedroom.I go round checking doors  times over. My husband had his wedding ring stolen. It is going to take a very long time to feel safe again.Another said: My bedroom and personal space was invaded. Even today I have flashbacks.I am still left out of pocket. The biggest impact has been emotional.Officers made a breakthrough on September , , when traffic cops monitoring an uninsured car on the M watched as a bag containing jewellery, stolen from a home in Solihull, was thrown from a window.Zaharia was arrested and his DNA taken which later matched to a blood stain found at a burglary.Police intelligence linked Zaharia to an address in Oldbury and on December  cops executed a warrant at the house where all five were detained.Bundles of cash and stolen jewellery was also recovered – as well as £, in Spiru’s handbag – alongside burglary “paraphernalia” including several pairs of rubber grip gloves and tools.Sgt Sandy Thompson said: “This group has been responsible for untold heartache, worry and inconvenience among hundreds of residents across the region. It’s one of the biggest burglary conspiracies we’ve ever seen in the West Midlands.We’ve linked them directly to  burglaries where £, and property valued at £, was taken – but we suspect they’ve committed far more offences and taken cash and valuables worth millions of pounds. Four or five hundred is a conservative estimate.They were ruthlessly organised: they would scope out homes in affluent areas, wait till nightfall and strike at addresses with the lights off that appeared unoccupied.“They always broke in via first floor windows to avoid alarm sensors on the ground floor, to get straight into bedrooms where valuables were likely to be kept and even took jewellery testing kits with them to test the purity of gold items at the scene.The group made regular money transfers to family members back home via Oldbury post office and other outlets.We also found lots of photos showing friends and family in Romania posing in expensive jewellery taken from homes in our communities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"woman leg gash young farmers ball","story":"The -year-old suffered the gaping wound to her leg at the dinner dance event at Tillington Hall Hotel, Stafford, on Friday, September .Cops have now launched a probe and are trawling CCTV in a bid to get to the bottom of mystery incident which left one member of Eccleshall YFC needing several stitches.The woman suffered a deep cm cut to the back of her right leg at around .pm - but it not yet known what happened.She was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital where the wound was stitched together but has since been released.Staffordshire Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs has now released a statement.A spokesman said: We are saddened that one of its YFC members was injured during Eccleshall Young Farmers’ Clubs’The YFC member involved has received hospital treatment and is now back home with her family.We are in contact with the YFC member and their family to support them during this dficult time.

Her latest visa renewal was rejected because of an administrative cock-up, leading to threats of deportation and judicial actionshe so much as looked in the direction of a stethoscope. Logic has gone for an early bath.    Dr Chiang is from Taiwan. This isnapost, some say, to do with Brexit. Except of course that it is.It is to do with Theresa Mayaposs hostile environment, which is rooted in Tory Eurosceptic fears about freedom of movement. It relies on the same bureaucratic incompetence and intransigence as the Windrush scandal, which itself is being replayed with Spanish care workers, French bakers, and Polish farm labourers. A third of those who voted to Leave said they did so because of fears about immigration.If you vote for fewer immigrants, fewer immigrants is what you get.That third of people have begun to realise that a lack of migrants would leave the NHS, care system, economy and society as a whole bereft of millions of people who hold the rest of us up and who now, eventhey are able to stay, feel about as welcome as nail fungus.  Racists who voted for Brexit were in fact voting for more brown people. Those who voted for more money for public services are finding the promises donapost match the cuts theyaposve already endured. Those who demanded more Parliamentary control see Parliament attacked for exerting it, and the battle for sovereignty has become, after several court cases over Article  and prorogation, to be a fight to give Prime Ministers the right to rule like tyrants. Johnsonaposs best plan for Brexit - the one he said would solve it all, which he torpedoed a previous deal for because it was not as good as his - is imposing two borders in the place where youaposre not allowed to have one.Three years weaposve spent on this. And Johnsonaposs stated intent is for it to last at least another , which will be followed by Northern Ireland voting on whether to abandon the UK. Itaposs like weaposve all been sold a Mercedes, and now it comes to delivery the salesman is offering us a fish and a banana, and promising thatwe just smash them together a Mercedes will appear.    It did not ask, on the ballot paper,we wished to be ruled by a lower grade of s*** than David Cameron. It did not suggest dissolution of the Union, anti-Semitic tropes about rootless and metropolitan elites from predominantly-Jewish parts of London, or a government so bereft of self-awareness it blames opponents for kne crime which is entirely due to a decade of its own spending cuts. It did not suggest we put a confessed cokehead in charge of No Deal planning, that raging Tory grandees be ejected from their own party conference, that the crime of sexual harassment become so normalised the PM canapost even remember whether he did it or not.The ballot paper asked uswe wished to eat an omelette, or remove the eggs from it first. Many people voted for the latter, which I can understand because itaposd be interesting to see someone de-whisk an egg.The spectacle of it actually happening, though, has not been funny. Itaposs been one long, plummeting realisation that the people juggling the eggs are completely round-the-bend, honking pig-people who need the attentions of doctors far more urgently than we do.   There are sane and reasoned arguments to Leave the EU. These people have never made them. There are sane and reasonable ways to exit its institutions. These people have neither the interest nor the intellect to achieve it. Leavers are frustrated, not because of those pointing out all the above, but because it is becoming increasingly obvious theyaposve been taken for a ride by charlatans, prats and double-speaking zealots.The claims of letaposs get Brexit done ring hollow, especially when you consider that evenwe get a deal we still have to resolve the Northern Irish border, trade deals and immigration and this lot have as much hope of doing that as they do of getting through the week without committing a crime.  The UK is victim of a giant mis-selling scandal. The scam has been perpetrated by conmen with long records of chicanery and criminality. It has cost us billions, and weaposll never get our time or our money back.In a fair and reasonable world, we could complain to someone. Only the police have been fired, the court system kneecapped, rules thrown on a bonfire of regulations.Luckily we can still vote. And we will, in our frustrated, irritated, horried droves.

Conservative delegates were heard laughing after the comment at a fringe event last night in Manchester. Another activist at the same event said the Labour leader should go to Traitoraposs Gate. It was unclearBoris Johnson heard the remarks. He did not respond to them. The remarks are likely to reignite a row over Boris Johnsonaposs and his supportersapos use of harsh language despite violent death threats against MPs. The comments were captured on video by both HuffPost UK and Sky News last night at a packed conference reception with Mr Johnson and DUP leader Arlene Foster.  Mr Johnson was heard saying: Letaposs get ready together to get, take, invite that threat to the union, Jeremy Corbyn, to step quietly, weaposre going to remove him... In a reference to the portal prisoners would pass through at the Tower of London, one activist shouted: Traitorsapos gate! As some activists laughed Mr Johnson - who was standing alongside DUP leader Arlene Foster - continued: ... Step quietly, step quietly, into a figurative... At this point another activist was heard talking across the Prime Minister, saying: Noose. Talking across him, Mr Johnson said: ... Rocket, and that will send him... and then let us send him into orbit where he belongs.    Activists at the event laughed loudly after the words noose and rocket were uttered. It was not immediately clear from the clip which comment they laughed at. It was also unclearthe Prime Minister heard the remarks. The activists have not been identied.

The shop, called Gross Domestic Product, sells artwork including le vests washed up on the shores of the Mediterranean that were hand-stitched by women in Greek migrant camps. Banksy says he has been forced to open the shop following a legal dispute with a greeting card company. Mark Stephens, an arts lawyer and founder of the Design and ArtistsSociety, described the row as frankly ludicrous litigation.It began after a card company tried to sell Banksy merchandise, forcing the mysterious street artist to produce his own in order to avoid someone  claiming the trademark, My London reports.   Although people will be able to visit the store for the next two weeks, its doors will never open and the lights will remain on  hours a day. Mr Stephens said: Banksy is in a dficult position because he doesnapost produce his own range of shoddy merchandise and the law is quite clear:the trademark holder is not using the mark, then it can be transferred to someone who will. As a solution to the issue, Mr Stephens proposed that Bansky launch his own range of merchandise and open a shop.  The artist said: The proceeds from these products will go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace the one confiscated by Italian authorities. So you may well be committing a criminal offence by purchasing them. Sometimes you go to work and itaposs hard to know what to paint, but for the past few months Iaposve been making stuff for the sole purpose of fulfilling trademark categories under EU law.

Emily Gosling, , had been working for her familyaposs rum business in Ontario, Canada since  - before relocating to London five years later. However before the move and during a business trip to Vancouver in May , she met wine director Dave Bulters, also . Despite the pair hitting it off instantly, Emily went on to relocate the next year - ing once more for a business trip to Canada where she went on her fist date with Dave Although living thousands of miles apart, they opted to try long distance - speaking about how theyaposd one day decorate a flat together and what trips they would take when they were reunited. However, earlier this year Emily began experiencing night sweats, bloating, kidney pain and fatigue before she was eventually given the devastating news in March that she had germ cell oian cancer. Within a week of her diagnosis, Dave flew to London to be with Emily. Emily began chemotherapy immediately, followed by surgery to remove the seven-inch tumour.    The cancer diagnosis derailed the coupleaposs plans to live together, but Dave made the decision to quit his job in Vancouver to move to London permanently so he could support Emily. Emily believes that the months spent living together in London deeply strengthened their relationship because he remained by her side throughout her cancer battle. She said: The afternoon of my diagnosis, I met with a gynaecological oncology surgeon to discuss my options. It was shocking to hear all of this over a few hours. Then a few days later, I had a CT scan to determine whether the cancer had spread, fortunately it hadnapost. My GP said that based on the results of the CT, and the size and speed of tumour growth, I would undergo four to six months of chemotherapy to shrink the tumour before they operated. Dave arrived in London on March , and he came to an appointment with my oncologist where we were hoping to arrange a treatment plan for when I ed to Vancouver. What we were told instead was that the tumour was too aggressive, and Iaposd be starting chemotherapy that evening! After being told the shocking news of how aggressive her cancer was, Emily said Dave immediately made the decision to quit his job to be at her side.    She added: Dave and I walked to a nearby park. It was there that he told me that he was going to quit his job and move to London. I was so relieved, but I was also so angry because cancer hadnapost only taken over my le, it had taken over his too. Emily began chemotherapy at the end of March before having surgery on May  to remove the tumour, which was seven inches long and over three inches wide. Surgeons also removed her right oy, right fallopian tube, appendix and lymph nodes, leaving her with  staples in her sternum. In June, Emilyaposs oncologist permitted her toto Vancouver to complete her treatment as her recovery from surgery was going well. Emily said she was proud of what their relationship has endured, adding: The one positive thing about the cancer diagnosis was that we got to live together sooner than weaposd planned, even though the situation wasnapost quite what we had planned. Thereaposs no doubt that the months in London strengthened our relationship.

Martyn Evans, , was found dead on a sofa hours just hours after drinking heavily with four friends. The two men and two women decided to have a bit of fun at his expense and filmed their treatment of Martyn, including trying to shave his eyebrows. They poured bleach and washing-up liquid on his head - and put a banana up his nostril.An inquest at Avon Coroneraposs Court heard Martyn was more intoxicated than the rest of the group, and was clearly out of it on the sofa as the antics went on.A coroner said: I find the behaviour of these four iniduals towards Martyn, a vulnerable man, to be appalling.    After attempting to wash some of the bleach out of Martynaposs hair, the group then carried him back to the sofa to sleep - and found him dead there just hours later. The four people involved - aged between  and  - pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court in August this year to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They were each handed an -month community order, with rehabilitation, but their bullying actions were not linked to Martynaposs death. Coroner Dr Peter Harrowing recorded a short narrative conclusion at Martynaposs inquest - stating that he was unable to determine how the young man came by his death. The inquest heard that Martyn, who lived in Withywood, Bristol, had a long history of learning and developmental dficulties. On October , , the night before his death, he had gone with two friends to the home of another two of their friends in Highridge, Bristol, for an evening of drinking. According to one female member of the group, who claimed she was not drinking that night, Martyn and the other three drank around  cans between them, the inquest heard. When paramedics from South-West ambulance service were called to the address in Highridge shortly after .am the following morning, they found Martyn in a state of rigamortis on the sofa. Mr Harper said he spoke to Martynaposs friend who lived in the house, who seemed visibly distressed and very shaken. The man explained that Martyn had come round the night before with another friend and that Martyn had been drinking Stella Artois beer throughout the night. He told Mr Harper he was not sure how much Martyn had consumed, but he was drunk, and at am, the man had helped him to the sofa to sleep, the inquest heard. He said that he next saw Martyn when he walked into the sitting room at .am and found him dead. The inquest heard that PC Matthew Stanford and Sergeant Lisa Colton, of Avon and Somerset Police, then attended the scene. The two officers entered the sitting room and saw Martyn on his back on the sofa, covered with a white duvet, and with vomit stains on his upper jeans, the neckline of his t-shirt, and the soles of his socks.  They then concluded that Martynaposs death was a tragic accident, and that he could have choked on his own vomit after being left to sleep on his back whilst extremely drunk, the inquest heard.

With over-the-counter cream failing to sht the then penny sized growth, the -year-old visited her GP. Rachelaposs doctor agreed it looked like a verruca, but a swab showed no evidence of the virus. She was referred to hospital for a biopsy which led her to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma - a type of skin cancer - six months after she first noticed the sore spot on her foot. Surgeons removed a lot of tissue in order to get rid of all the cancer, leaving Rachel, from Worcestershire, in need of plastic surgery to replace part of her heel.    The mum-of-three spoke of how she dismissed the growth as a minor ailment for months. Everyone I showed it to thought it was a verruca too, but by Christmas it had become the size of a penny and was quite sore to walk on, she said. The diagnosis was so hard to take in. Iaposve always loved the sun but Iaposm sure the rest of my body has seen more sun than the sole of my foot.    Even the consultant was shocked as it didnapost look like a typical melanoma and it was in an unusual place. I was even more shocked that I had to go home and tell my two boys I had cancer. The dermatologist decided to remove it there and then, so I was left with a gaping hole in the bottom of my foot. Following further surgery to remove the cancer at Birminghamaposs Queen Elizabeth Hospital, she noticed a lump in her groin In November .    Rachel, an administrator at a GP surgery, added: They thought it was just a cyst and I was told to enjoy my Christmas.

Rachel is now raising money for Stand Up To Cancer, a joint fundraising campaign from Cancer Research UK and Channel .

During a speech to young entrepreneurs this morning Harry spoke about his first visit in , when Charles told him and brother William to pack their bags as they were going to Africa to get away from it all. He said: I know that there are daily struggles that most of us couldn’t begin to imagine. Yet I have seen strength, resilience, a sense of hope and empathy that I can only aspire to replicate.    Ever since I came to this continent as a young boy, trying to cope with something I can never possibly describe, Africa has held me in an embrace that I will never forget, and I feel incredibly fortunate for that. And every time I come here I know that I’m not alone. I always feel - wherever I am on this continent - that the community around me provides a le that is enriching, and is rooted in the simplest things - connection, connections with others and the natural environment.    He also spoke about Archie, and how he hopes to share what he has taken from his visits with his little boy. He said: As I raise my own son, I want to make sure that what I’ve learned here – the value of the natural world, the value of community and friendship – is something that I can pass on to him. Harry also spoke about launching his own charity foundation with Meghan next year after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs Royal Foundation, saying what he had seen this trip would inspire their work. Meghan also spoke during the visit, saying she too was inspired by the people she had met and thanking them for being so welcoming.    Prince Harryaposs speech in full Thank you very much Tash for welcoming us to this extraordinary place! I’ve got to be honest, it’s a bit of a whirlwind to cover five countries in nine days, but what a place and what a community to finish on here in Tembisa. There is no doubt in my mind that you here at the YES hub are the future leaders and pillars of your communities - for many, you already are. You are the change-makers. You are helping to grow your country’s prosperity by lting those around you and offering a better future.  This continent is going through a period of change. Africa needs to create  million jobs by , and while youth unemployment is a global challenge, it’s particularly a problem here where nearly % of young people are unemployed.    Starting adult le in this way can start a cycle of poverty that can be dficult to escape, but you guys are producing solutions, and for that, we commend you. For this reason, I’m incredibly proud to share that the UK is going to provide £million for a “Skills for Prosperity” programme working with the South African Government and other partners.  This programme is going to maximise African ingenuity with UK support to fill the gap between the skills that employers urgently need, and the training offered to employees. In my role as The Queen’s Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, I am so incredibly fortunate to meet young people who are determined to make a real dference and make their mark on the world through action. Meeting people like you makes me realise that the world is in good hands. We’re going to see your President this afternoon as well and we will tell him all we have seen and heard. It is so great to see the South Africa - UK relationship so strong.    I have often talked about Africa as my second home, and I’ve often been asked why I love it so much. Well, over these last  days I have been trying to put my feelings and experiences into words, which is not easy! I wanted to try and answer a more specic question for myself - what is the essence of Africa  Why is it that so many visitors feel Africa gets under our skin and into our soul  Last night I ed from my third visit to the th poorest country in the world - Malawi. Despite extreme hardship and ongoing challenges on so many levels, people are generous, they are strong, humble and incredibly optimistic. I know that there are daily struggles that most of us couldn’t begin to imagine. Yet I have seen strength, resilience, a sense of hope and empathy that I can only aspire to replicate. Ever since I came to this continent as a young boy, trying to cope with something I can never possibly describe, Africa has held me in an embrace that I will never forget, and I feel incredibly fortunate for that. And every time I come here I know that I’m not alone. I always feel - wherever I am on this continent - that the community around me provides a le that is enriching, and is rooted in the simplest things - connection, connections with others and the natural environment. And as I raise my own son, I want to make sure that what I’ve learned here – the value of the natural world, the value of community and friendship – is something that I can pass on to him.    Next year we launch our new foundation and it’s moments like today and meeting all of you, that inspires us. Whether supporting young entrepreneurs, empowering women and girls, or challenging the issue of gender-based violence…Whether it’s been planting trees, clearing landmines, or protecting the most beautul creatures and places on this planet - these experiences have affirmed our love of Africa, and the issues that are so important to us. We will firmly stand up for what we believe. We are fortunate enough to have a position that gives us amazing opportunities, and we will do everything that we can to play our part in building a better world. We will always seek to challenge injustice and to speak out for those who may feel unheard. So no matter your background, your nationality, your age or gender, your sexuality, your physical ability, no matter your circumstance or colour of your skin – we believe in you, and we intend to spend our entire lives making sure you have the opportunity to succeed and change the world. Thank you. Meghanaposs speech in full There is not much I can add to that, outside saying that on our last day here in South Africa, thank you all so much.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis terraced home in Wales may look fairly typical on the outside, but it throws up a few surprises once you step through the door. The owners of the house in Neath have applied a unique personal style inside.Now, Wales Online reports , normal walls and doors have been replaced by entrances framed with glass bricks.And throughout itaposs rooms there are several interesting visual touches that demand instant attention. This is probably most evident in the huge kitchen-diner at the rear of the property.  Instead of the expected small kitchen and rear dining room of a terraced house, there is a large extension that provides a very sociable and light space. In this room the art deco basics are pretty much covered. There are colour LEDs hidden away that provide accent colours typical of the s think Miami sea-front home or cool American diner. The sunken ceiling provides the classic art deco lozenge shape as well as the space to hide the mint green accent lighting. There are subtle curves included in the interior design, mainly provided by the unusual semi-circular kitchen island which also has hidden pink LEDs for the continuation of the Miami feel.  There is symmetry provided by the black splash-back tiles, the triple set of French doors to the garden plus the inventive use of glass bricks again. Both ends of the room have a symmetrical set of glass blocks that not only provide extra light, they continue the art deco theme initially set in the hallway. The fireplace at one end of the kitchen is an amazing chrome log burner, reminiscent of the vintage, cigar-shaped art decor chrome caravans in shape and texture. The house has benefited from not only from losing some walls and widening some doorways, but also from a two-storey rear extension. The ground floor accommodation is vast compared to what any visitor might expect from the outside.  There is a separate sitting room and dining room that could both become bedrooms, turning the home from a surprising five bed into an incredible seven bed property. This would still leave the house with a separate lounge and the large kitchen-diner. The versatility of this unusual home continues upstairs, in fact up two flights of stairs as, although not obvious from the outside, this house also has a loft conversion which has a surprise. Instead of a standard dormer, there is a window that continues down the roof to the floor to provide easy access onto a terrace that is the roof of the extension. Genius. Of course the view from the roof terrace is unusual, this house is brilliant at being unique, and looks out onto Neath RFCaposs rugby pitch - so no need to buy a season ticket, although some scrums might be missed due to annoying hedges in the way.  Back to the first floor and the whole width of the rear of the property has been converted into a huge master suite. The master bedroom is so large it can easily accommodation a three-piece suite and has a walk-in wardrobe and dressing room bigger than most terrace homeaposs third bedroom. In fact, it probably used to be this terraceaposs aposbox roomapos. Again the homeaposs versatility is evident, as the master bedroom could be ided into two bedrooms to increase the sleeping accommodation,changing theof any of the living space downstairs is not appealing to a new owner. The main bathroom on the first floor does not disappoint on the aposwow factorapos either.

The -mile-wide Hurricane Lorenzo has been dubbed a real beast by the Met Office. Hurricanes on the scale of Lorenzo are rare so far north and east in the Atlantic Basin, and it is whipping up huge swells as it tracks towards the UK and Ireland.    Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said it was unusual for a category  hurricane to brew in that part of the Atlantic. He said it posed a threat mostly to shipping only, as it reached its most powerful far from land. Keates added: “To get a storm that far east in the Atlantic has not occurred before so it broke a record in the area- it looks like it did.” “It’s one of the strongest that the Atlantic has ever been exposed to.”    Lorenzo slammed its might into the Portugese coastline today, sending waves soaring to heights of more than ft in the Azores region. And waves are due to reach ft off the coast of Ireland and ft along Englandaposs southwest coast according to coastal maps.    The ex-tropical stormaposs arrival in the British and Irish isles will see powerful gales pummel the Irish west coast from tomorrow afternoon and Englandaposs south-westaposs coastline on Friday. Keats said the ex-tropical storm will pack less of the punch Portugal felt by the time it reaches Ireland and the UK, as the hurricane undergoes a transition and develops into a weaker system.    He said: It will be a weak shadow of its former self, thankfully.” However the Met Office is still warning the high winds could still bring disruption for some.The Met Office earlier issued  flood warnings and  alerts across England.It has issued a yellow weather warning for Irelandaposs coastal west, warning south-easterly winds could bring transport disruption late on Thursday. Delays to road, rail, air and ferry travel are likely and coastal communities can expect large waves, the forecaster says. A second yellow weather warning covers the south of Wales and southwest of England on Friday.    The Met Office is warning coastal communities to expect  big waves and delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely. Nevertheless, the forecast says say gusts of around mph are in-store for the Irish west coast by tomorrow evening, and mph in Northern Ireland. The Met Office is also predicting gusts of around mph for Englandaposs south-west on Friday, with other parts blustery throughout the day. Lorenzo is also set to bring a spell of heavy rain to much of the UK mainly on Thursday night and into Friday.

The Met Office has issued  flood warnings and  alerts across England. Temperatures will reach highs of C today, after dropping to lows of C in parts of Scotland earlier this morning. Hurricane Lorenzo is currently south west of The Azores, where it is expected to pass with mph winds today. Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said: It could bring some very large swell by the end of the week to the UK as well as some heavy rainfall and we donapost need more rainfall. Risk of some strong winds, gales in places, some heavy rainfall as well, and some big seas. Parts of Ireland are expected to feel the worst of Lorenzoaposs impact with Met Eireann saying there will be signicant storm and wave surges around coastal areas.   Met Eireann has also warned some areas may experience thunderstorms which could lead to flooding, reports the Irish Mirror. The Met Office said there has been some uncertainty over its path, but it now looks like it will follow a north-easterly track towards the UK and Ireland. When it arrives in these latitudes some time on Thursday, it will have lost its hurricane strength, but will still mean another wet and windy battering for the west of the country. Chief meteorologist at the Met Office Dan Suri said: There has been considerable uncertainty over the potential track of Lorenzo after it passes The Azores. However, we are now increasingly confident the remnants of Lorenzo will move towards the UK, bringing a spell of wet and very windy weather to western parts on Thursday and Friday. Mr Suri said the strongest winds are expected in western Ireland, with a risk of coastal gales developing in Northern Ireland and western Scotland on Thursday and Wales and south-west England on Friday.    He said ex-Lorenzo will also bring spells of heavy rain to north-western parts of the UK through Thursday and Friday, particularly in Northern Ireland, western Scotland, central England and Wales. Mr Suri said: Our advice is to pay close attention to the weather forecast over the next couple of days and to keep an eye out for any weather warnings that may be issued in your area.

Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said: It could bring some very large swell by the end of the week to the UK as well as some heavy rainfall and we donapost need more rainfall. Risk of some strong winds, gales in places, some heavy rainfall as well, and some big seas.    Here are where flood warnings have been issued for: River Aire at West Haddlesey, Chapel Haddlesey and East Haddlesey River Anker at Mancetter, Witherley and Atherstone River Don at Thorpe in Balne River Mease at Clton Campville, Harlaston and Croxall River Ouse at Naburn Lock River Ouse at York - riverside properties River Ouse at York - St George`s Field and Queen`s Staith River Sence from Temple Mill to Sheepy Magna River Severn at Sandhurst and Maisemore River Soar at caravan park near Barrow upon Soar River Trent at Alkborough Flats River Trent at Beckingham Marsh River Trent at Catton, Barton under Needwood and Branston Water Park River Ure at Aldwark Bridge to Cuddy Shaw River Vyrnwy at Maesbrook River Vyrnwy at Melverley River Wreake for mills at Hoby, Thrussington and RatclfeOn Hurricane Lorenzo, the Met Office said: Currently to the southwest of the Azores, Lorenzo is the strongest hurricane to have been recorded so far east in the Atlantic. Lorenzo is expected to maintain Category winds as it passes close to the Azores today and Wednesday, before transitioning into a deep low pressure system as it follows a north-easterly track towards the UK and Ireland. Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, Dan Suri said: “There has been considerable uncertainty over the potential track of Lorenzo after it passes The Azores. However we are now increasingly confident the remnants of Lorenzo will move towards the UK, bringing a spell of wet and very windy weather to western parts on Thursday and Friday.  “At the moment the strongest winds are expected in western Ireland, with a risk of coastal gales developing in Northern Ireland and western Scotland on Thursday and Wales and south-west England on Friday.  Ex-Lorenzo will also bring spells of heavy rain to north-western parts of the UK through Thursday and Friday, particularly in Northern Ireland, western Scotland, central England and Wales.  “Our advice is to pay close attention to the weather forecast over the next couple of days and to keep an eye out for any weather warnings that may be issued in your area.

While remarkable teenager Greta Thunberg has become the face of global climate change protests, kids from all over the world have joined forces to defiantly say enough is enough.    The  filed a complaint against Argentina, France, Brazil, Germany and Turkey to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. All these countries have known about the dangers for years, but have failed to act, the Children vs Climate Crisis campaigners claim. If the UN rules climate change is a childrenaposs rights crisis, all five countries could be forced to commit to binding emission reduction targets. Here are the brave youngsters fighting this battle: Ridhima Pandey, , In spite of her tender years, Ridhima, from Haridwar, India, already has experience at taking on governments. In , aged just nine, she sued the Indian government for not doing enough to tackle climate change. She said: I want a better future. I want to save my future. I want to save our future. I want to save the future of all the children and all people of future generations. Deborah Adegbile, , Deborah, known as Debby, lives in Lagos, where longer rainy seasons have led to frequent flooding. Sometimes it gets so bad that her parents have to carry her because she cannot walk though the high waters. Debby said: “I will tell our world leaders to pay attention to the cries of their citizens about the effect of this climate change.” Catarina Lorenzo, , Catarina, from Salvador, dreams of becoming a professional surfer, and spends a lot of time on Brazilaposs beaches. But she believes adults are not doing enough to protect the environment. She said: “We will not permit them to take our future away. They had the right to have their future why don’t we have the right to have our own ”  Just eight years old, Ellen-Anne became involved in activism because she is worried about reindeer. Both her parents are herders from the Sami community, but increasing temperatures and rainfall threaten their way of le, with dramatic changes to the ecosystem. Her mum, Susanna Rikko, said: “Herding reindeer is our le. It’s everything. We live with, and we live off the reindeers, and I can’t even imagine a le without them.” Iris Duquesne, , Earlier this year avid surfer Iris, from Bordeaux, moved to Calornia in the US, and dedicated herself to raising awareness of climate change. She said the case has been filed “to makeunderstand that there is a real emergency.” Raina Ivanova, ,   German schoolgirl Raina, from Hamburg, leads by example in her desire to address the climate change crisis. Every Friday she takes part in Fridays for the Future, an initiative which sees children skip school to raise awareness. The teenager told the UN: I’m here today because the climate change is not just affecting all of us, it’s affecting every single person in this room and every single human being on our planet. And I want you to take your responsibility and make decisions today you can still be proud of in  years. David Ackley, III, ,   David, from capital Majuro, said rising sea levels have been pronounced over the past five years. The teenager said: “I feel lost. I like to keep my mind off [climate change] because it scares me, but it still pops up a couple of times a day.” Ranton Anjain, ,   Rantonaposs family home was destroyed in a storm in , and he said seawalls built to protect the population have proved to be useless. Increasing heat has been blamed for an outbreak of dengue, and said climate change is threatening his way of lfe. He said: “I don’t want to be underwater. I want future generations to experience what I experience, I want them to experience living on Ebeye. It still saddens me – I want them to experience the same things I did.” Litokne Kabua, ,   The teenager told the UN that the ocean has crept up on his family home in recent years because of climate change. He said: I am here because I am going to speak on behalf of my people, because we are on the frontline of climate crisis. And I am here to stop that. Carlos Manuel, , from Palau    Carlos has lived in Palau for the last nine years, and saw the devastation caused by super typhoon Haiyan, which struck in November . The teenager said world leaders should be taking note of rising sea levels, temperature increases and more extreme storms. He said: “We all have the right to enjoy our planet and we should all protect that right. Our generation is trying to prevent climate change for future generations.” Ayakha Melithafa, , from South Africa    Ayakha, from the outskirts of Cape Town, has endured droughts, which have affected crops and livestocks on her familyaposs farm. She said in a statement: “People who are older aren’t paying as much attention because they will not be as affected. They don’t take us children seriously, but we want to show them we are serious.” Greta Thunberg, , from Sweden    One of the best-known activists in the world, Greta needs little introduction. After seeing a video about climate change when she was eight, she stopped eating and speaking before turning to activism. She said: “The climate crisis is not just the weather. It means also, lack of food and lack of water… places that are unlivable and refugees because of it. It is scary.” Raslene Jbeili, , from Tunisia  In recent years the climate in Rasleneaposs coastal town of Tabarka has changed dramatically. Where it previously experienced mild and dry summers and cold winters, recently it has become increasingly hot, with more wildfires. One such fire claimed the homes of his neighbours. Raslene said: “It is our duty as children to do anything no matter the cost to save our planet and to live in a safer world.” Carl Smith, , from the USA    Carl, a member of the indigenous Yupiaq community, has noticed warmer temperatures are affecting the tribeaposs ability to hunt and gather berries. He is worried that his family will not be able to live off the land in the future, as they have for generations. The teenager said: “If the world leaders listen to us, children can make a dference in this world, because we’re the ones that are going to be affected.” Chiara Sacchi, ,   The teenager, from Buenos Aires, is furious about extreme weather in her home, and fears for the future. She said: I’m truly mad. It’s not like ‘Oh, I’m sad.’ I’m angry! We are alone here and there aren’t a lot of people that will take action. I’m mad.

Footage shows the animal aggressively snapping at the roadside in the state of Telangana, southern India. Police and forest officials eventually called in a JCB to move the crocodile off the side of the road. They used the machinery to pin the animalaposs tail before safely restraining it. Officials then tie its jaws with bright yellow ropes, bagging its head, as a crowd of villagers gather to watch the scene.    After being examined for injuries, the reptile was released back into the river Godai. It is believed the large animal clambered onto land after water levels rose during the monsoon season. A forest official confirmed the crocodile was reportedly affecting the movement of traffic on the highway. He said: The Godai river flowing close to the village had turned turbulent and muddy, apparently forcing the crocodile to wade out of the fast-flowing river.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

Sheep can be used in so many ways to benefit the environment and naivety from mainstream media risks increasing our environmental footprint.’Livestock is also widely criticised for its methane emissions which NSA say is, again, misleading.Mr Stocker added: ‘Methane shouldn’t be ignored it is an emitted gas that has an impact on global warming.

That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  Nothing like a dame to perk up this panto","story":"The Andrew Marr Show chose the latter strategy. It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week. On Marr, Helen Mirren said Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, once advised that it was best to praise in a loud voice and scold in a whisper. How wise. It was worth having the grand dame on after all."},{"url":null,"title":"politicians-end-brazen-disregard-women","story":"After initially declining to comment, a No  spokesperson eventually issued a response saying: ldquoThe allegations are untrue.rsquorsquoAs his colleagues took to the airwaves to stand by their man, you got the sense that their hearts werenrsquot really in it.

Far more concerning for Number  will be the questions about his ldquoclose friendshiprsquorsquo with tech entrepreneur Jenner Arcuri and whether he used his influence as Mayor of London to help secure funding for her business.Because they know - and we know - that non-consensual touching wonrsquot provoke as much public anger as the suggestion that tax-payersrsquo money might have been used improperly.The naked partisanship on display whenever we see women making allegations about powerful men in politics are as predictable as they are distasteful.The warm words and grave expressions that we saw in the wake of the Westminster harassment scandal have been replaced ndash as many women at the time predicted they would be ndash with knee-jerk politicking and spin.The power dynamics which underpin these tales of impropriety and sexism are cast to one side as political parties close ranks to protect one of their own.

But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"headline","story":"The charity Alzheimer Scotland says dementia is not treated as an illness with progressive and complex physical and cognitive symptoms and needs are assessed as social care rather than healthcare, which leaves iniduals and their families facing ldquodisproportionate charges.A campaign launched today by The Herald and our sister title the Evening Times backs the charityrsquos call to the Government to ensure all patients with advanced dementia can access specialist nurses, palliative care and consultant geriatricians at no cost in the final months or years of their lives.Carers groups say being asked to pay for nursing costs comes as a ldquoshock to many families ndash weekly care home costs with -hour specialist nursing can reach pound,.Alzheimer Scotland will launch a new documentary today in Glasgow, as part of its campaign push, which aims to highlight the ldquounfair disparity of dementia care costs, featuring former STV anchor Mike Edwards whose mother was diagnosed with vascular dementia in .Estimates suggest around , Scots are living with advanced dementia.ldquoThe Governmentrsquos callous dismissal of the plight of these sick and dying people makes me feel angry and sad that my country has abandoned them, my husband and me, for the sake of money.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Fair Care dementia film\",\"description\": \"Fair Care dementia film\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ihGQsNb poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ihGQsNb.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Henry Simmons, chief executive of Alzheimer Scotland, said: ldquoThe nature of dementia is that you could be living well for many years and enjoying a good quality of le but your needs will start to change and you will require more support.ldquoPatients are in a social care assessment situation and have to pay for elements of their care as a result of that, but the problem is there is not a reassessment from when their needs change from social care to almost entirely healthcare.ldquoIf they go into a residential care setting, someone with advanced dementia requires -hour nursing care, help to eat, to toilet, to bathe. All of which would be described as NHS healthcare needs.ldquoHowever, there is no definition within our current policy for advanced dementia. This person has now progressed and at that point they need healthcare and it should be free.ldquoThe model would be that an advanced specialist team will come in to allow that person to remain where they want to remain be that at home or in a care home which could be specialist geriatricians, palliative care, nursing care.ldquoThis is all readily available but you donrsquot see that being brought to the person where they are. The cancer specialists we see are clear that the level of support is far better than what they experience in their own personal lives with regard to dementia.ldquoWith dementia there is also loss of capacity, soyou think about it we are still taking thousands of pounds out of their bank account for care which we would argue is healthcare. Thatrsquos where the injustice lies. Itrsquos a huge amount of money for some people. These are people who have paid into our system their whole lives, who have built our societies. For us to say, we canrsquot afford that, itrsquos unjustiable.Alzheimer Scotland is also campaigning for improvements in the support offered to people with dementia and their families.The Scottish Government says every person diagnosed with dementia is entitled to a year of post-diagnostic support.However, according to the charity less than half of those diagnosed are referred because of a shortage of dedicated link workers, who may be mental health nurses, occupational therapists or social workers.Mr Simmons said: ldquoA link worker costs around pound, per year per person. The evidence is that it can delay admission to a care home for two to three years.The Scottish Government has said it is considering the findings of a report by the charity, Delivering Fair Dementia Care for People with Advanced Dementia.The report says residential care-charging policies are confusing and can result in signicant costs, particularly for those classed as self-funding.The charity estimates that  per cent of funds are going towards care.Mr Simmonds said: ldquoThe question is not so much how do we pay for this, itrsquos do we want to pay for it  My problem isnrsquot to raise taxes and decide how we spend it, my problem is to represent those iniduals who donrsquot have a voice.ldquoWe have a duty to inform the policy makers and the public that this is an injustice and an inequality.ldquoThe response we have had from political parties, there are very few people who have said this is wrong. Irsquom not saying it can be fixed overnight.ldquoIn the society we want to live in which is a fair and inclusive one, we have a section of our population who will develop advanced dementia and require round-the-clock nursing care and itrsquos not right that we charge them for the privilege of that when no other condition is treated in that way.ldquoWersquove seeing some good progress, wersquove got all the models, all the research and itrsquos not all about massive amounts of money. We are inundated from people from America and Japan all wanting to use our models. Our models are about transforming the system without too much cost.

What we are saying is that when people reach that point, they should no longer be subject to care charges.ldquoYou might be in a residential care home.

People were particularly fascinated, it seemed, in her arresting collection of jewelled insect brooches. Yet what has struck me is her advice on how a woman can reach the top of her profession.Lady Hale offered her hard-won guidance at the launch of a group called Cambridge Women in Law. A graduate of Girton College, she told those following in her footsteps that few females can reach the upper echelons of the male-dominated legal world entirely by their own efforts. For starters, they will be battling against an engrained masculine sense of entitlement that puts them at an immediate disadvantage. Even more signicant, however, is their domestic situation. ldquoProbably the most important thing when you are making your way as a woman in the law is to choose the right partner, she said, doubtless making some of her listeners delete their last text message demanding to know what time theyrsquod be home to make dinner.:Boris Johnson cant remember grope allegation eventTwice married, Hale was quick to note that her first husband as well as her second had been completely supportive. Despite all her intellectual and emotional capabilities, which in a perfect universe would catapult her and those like her to stardom whatever their personal circumstances, she was unequivocal. The choice of whether to have a le partner, and who that partner is, will prove vital to a womanrsquos advancement. Clearly, what holds for the law is equally true for other walks of le. Facebookrsquos chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote, ldquoI donrsquot know of one woman in a leadership position whose le partner is not fully ndash and I mean fully ndash supportive of her career.You need only think of Philip May, acting discreetly behind the arras as Theresa Mayrsquos unofficial consigliere to see this principle borne out. While the PM negotiated the most dficult job in Europe, grafting into the small hours, and on call night and day, he provided the psychological underpinning, or scaffolding, on which she stood. That ultimately her plans imploded does not diminish the fact that without his bolstering presence, his enabling faith in her ability to carry on, she would not have had the mental strength to persevere to the bitter end.Finding a partner who will be wholly encouraging isnrsquot easy. Too often the romantic knot has been tied long before the pressures of a womanrsquos career begin to escalate. If by then a couple have children, it takes deep pockets to pay for household help and childcare while two demanding vocations are conducted at full throttle, or an unusually far-sighted and self-abnegating companion prepared to put their own job, and ego, into cold storage for a few years.Such iniduals do exist, but finding him or her, while in the first flush of youth, takes greater maturity than most possess. Conversely, by the time a woman is older, wiser, and more established in her role, the biological clock can be ticking so loudly it drowns out common sense when getting hitched. Add to this the fact that women in all-consuming careers, such as medicine, law or the media, tend to get involved with those in equally full-on occupations, with similarly vaulting ambitions.:Boris Johnson to make final offer to EU on BrexitLady Halersquos comments will have struck a nerve with many working women. You can picture them, conducting a silent audit on their partners over the toast and marmalade, wonderingthey fall into the category of clinging ivy or storm-proof trellis. Yet the evidence of those who reach the top has been there all along, and what this high-flying judge says should come as no surprise.As far back as the s the brilliant mathematician Mary Somerville flourished because her second husband recognised her talent and gave her space to pursue her ideas. She still had to make sure the children were cared for, and was obliged to drop everything when guests unexpectedly called, but by the standards of the day her spousersquos attitudes were truly enlightened. Pierre Curie was another such enabler, while closer to our own times there has been no more devoted partner than Denis Thatcher or George Clooney, each treating his other halfrsquos ambitions with absolute seriousness.Weary of being an invisible launch-pad, some women like to quip: ldquoBehind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. Yet one of the questions Halersquos speech raises is whether or not men who aspire to be top dog are equally reliant on a partnerrsquos support. Could it be that, even in these more egalitarian times, women are more in need of a human coat of armour than men Like it or not, a high-powered position is not easy to sustain, whether yoursquore male or female. The toll on those at home is heavy. For true harmony, a household has room for only one stratospheric performer. Yet the back-up and moral support essential to someonersquos professional success is not the mundane business of stocking the fridge or doing the laundry, necessary though these are. Five-star house-keeping alone is not enough.If a partnership s like a Swiss watch, each cog performing its assigned role and never missing a beat, itrsquoll soon run into troublethere isnrsquot something more nourishing keeping it ticking. Surely itrsquos the deep emotional connection with a loved one, and the intellectual stimulation essential to a good relationship, that help a person achieve their best I will concede that most women probably need more overt confidence-boosting. Yet given the dearth of us at the pinnacle of whatever profession you care to name, itrsquos far too soon to know whether those who reach the uppermost rungs need more unconditional back-up from their partners than men. Personally, I canrsquot see why there would be much dference. For the moment, though, you could say that on this subject the jury is still out."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10490705.jpg?type=article-full","title":"twitter-tweetdeck-dms-impacted-service-outage","story":"Reports show a major outage across the globe with the social media giant investigating the issue.As part of the system outage, Tweetdeck and DMs were also down.Twitter confirmed: \"Weve been experiencing outages across Twitter and TweetDeck.

to clary points raised in the last consultation - on the business, environmental and regulatory aspects of the technology.Mr Wheelhouse said at the time that the government wanted to set out its position ldquoas soon as possible after this process is complete, but failed to put any timetable on it.The website blunder also reveals  responses were received to the last consultation.It said: ldquoThe responses to this consultation, along with the  Talking Fracking consultation and  consultation on statutory and other assessments, were considered in detail by Ministers prior to the finalisation of this policy.Scottish Liberal Democrat energy spokesperson Liam McArthur MSP said: ldquoThe Scottish Government appeared to have confirmed their position on fracking via documents published accidentally online, rather than by announcing it to Parliament more than three years ago when Liberal Democrats pressed them to introduce a ban.ldquoAcross Central Scotland communities sat on or near sites potentially earmarked for fracking have been living in fear of what the Scottish Government might decide.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is the show that is put on by graduating students, and is an opportunity for the public to see what art students have been up to. It has also traditionally been the time when the owners of galleries might call in to seethe next David Hockney might be lurking in the fresh crop of graduates.The friend who accompanied me to the Edinburgh show is himself an artist, a graduate of a Scottish art college. His technique is painstaking and his art extremely sensitive. He takes a long time to finish a painting, and will worry about the tiniest detail. I remember another Scottish painter, the much admired Jim Howie, who used to labour in a similar way on his gorgeous, luminescent abstracts, scraping off layer after layer of paint, to replace it, and then rework that new layer after a while. Gradually from this process there emerged paintings that glowed with light. His paintings haunt the walls they hang upon.: Hockney tears a strip off Hirst ahead of exhibitionFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereElizabeth Blackadder studied here\u2028So off we went to the Art College, that splendid building with its high windows intended to claim the northern light so beloved of artists. It is a building of rich artistic associations: here Robin Philipson was Principal in these echoing studios artists such as Elizabeth Blackadder, William Gillies and Anne Redpath all learned how to paint. It is now no longer an independent college, but has had the good fortune to become part of the University of Edinburgh, which has opened up a lot of possibilities for it.I have been going to the degree shows for a long time, although I have hardly been to any in the last ten years. The reason for this was that they began to depress me. On the grounds that one should be prepared to reconsider things, I thought I might take a fresh look.Resisting the temptation to look at the intriguing displays of textile work, we went straight to the painting studios. There was some painting on display, but there was also a lot of conceptual work – installations of folded paper, old chairs etc. That raises other issues, but on the painting to begin with... I looked at my artist friend. His disappointment was obvious. I wonderedhe was asking himself whether painting was only acceptableit was being done ironically. We moved from room to room. Nothing was said. In large part, the work on display failed to excite. There seemed to be a prevailing blandness about it and, what was particularly diappointing, not a great deal of evidence of skill in painting or drawing. Now, painting and drawing used to be the building blocks of artistic ability, and they were taught with rigour. David Hockney is an example of how a thorough training in drawing makes a great artist. Of course, it seems that there has been a strong reaction against tradition, and art colleges do not emphasise these skills as they did in the past – hence the dissident schools that have been set up to make up for the lack of interest in the art colleges.: Generation shows off Scots modern art’s ersity: Ones to watch in : Katie Paterson, artistArt students seeking private helpAnd that lack of interest is widespread: I know a highly regarded Scottish artist who told me he has had art students coming to him privately, asking him to teach them the skills that they were just not getting at college, where such things have been relegated or dropped. Nobody wants to downplay the efforts of our art colleges or the creative impulses of their students.There are many talented students at the colleges who will be served by supportive artist tutors. The problem is that the situation seems to be somewhat unbalanced, with so little room being given to the traditional skills of painting and drawing.Escape from the exhibition was achieved by dodging ious installations – ropes and the like which might otherwise detain the visitor. Installation art has its possibilities, and it could be argued that all art is conceptual. The problem is that much contemporary installation art occupies a very small – and often opaque – intellectual space, frequently fails to rise above the banal, and is often impenetrably personal. Such art will be forgotten, with the rare exception of the odd decaying shark, Marcel Duchamps’ pissoir that started it all, and perhaps the occasional unmade bed or pile of bricks. For the rest, it’s all been done.Still, though, there are in our midst artists of signicance – those who have something to say about the human predicament, those who expose us to beauty or profound emotion, those who make us look at the world with new eyes: they are still there, and their innate skill has asserted itself. The danger is that they will be condescended to, as is often the fate of those who question the prevailing artistic orthodoxy, which currently seems excessively focused on identity issues – on looking in rather than reaching out.Painters survive in spite of the fact that all the glittering prizes are reserved for conceptual art. Could the art colleges not encourage – or enable – their students to be these people  Perhaps the answer is that which applies in so many other contexts: back to the drawing board.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"an accountant s guide to scotland s future prosperity craig vickery","story":"After Brexit, Scotland will need to find new ways to attract skilled migrants, improve the skills of its own workforce, build the infrastructure a modern economy requires and make better political decisions, writes Craig Vickery.The aim of the annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandstatistics is to “enhance public understanding of fiscal issues”.Whoever is in office at Holyrood will decide the expenditure of the country. And what should unite our political parties is the need to enhance national income and taxation revenue, to train and attract skilled people and bring high income jobs to Scotland.Growing the economy and making Scotland an even more attractive place to live, work and study is the paramount goal of our policymakers.But there are challenges ahead, first of which is the current status of Brexit negotiations. Recent statistics also show that unemployment has risen, while the number of Scots in work has fallen. The job market of the future requires a erse and broad range of skills to be successful and to be relevant in a fast-moving world. Firstly, we know that skilled migration in particular is needed to continue the growth of our population, and our economy. Those coming from overseas to make Scotland their home tend to be younger, but we can do more to encourage people to stay for longer or settle in remoter rural and island areas. And we can do more to retain the local population too. Local economies and small businesses are particularly reliant on the accounting profession, which will be of vital importance in exports in the future and be part of the ingredients of success for tomorrow’s Scotland.Secondly, with the economy virtually at full employment, the question of how Scotland will retain and continue to attract talent post-Brexit, particularly in the financial, hospitality and agriculture sectors must be answered. We must also embrace the need to upskill and retrain people already in employment. : Scotland could prosperindependent, says Finance Secretary, as £. billion financial ‘black hole’ emergesFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereHere at accountancy body ACCA, we’re evolving our continuing professional development and mentoring programmes to help the accounting profession to adapt – recognising that the accountant of the future requires a erse and broad range of skills to be successful and to be relevant in a fast-moving world. Our career patterns and pathways are evolving – the certainties of a few years ago are replaced by organic and stimulating opportunities. Ensuring that we develop and maintain the relevant accountancy skills and knowledge is essential. Through our ‘accelerate’ internship programme we have helped students from Glasgow Caledonian University and the University of the West of Scotland secure internships and paid employment with local employers – including a former forklt driver and Greggs baker who made a career change after  years!We are also piloting a Scotland-wide apprenticeship programme with Robert Gordon University, enabling people to get a degree and qualy while in employment.The value of international studentsThe UK Government’s positive announcement last month on extending the visa stay of international students post-graduation is welcome, and a step towards recognising the tremendous value international students bring to our society, economy and universities.This move enhances the attractiveness of the UK, and Scotland, as a place to live, work and study – with our world-leading universities – as well as opening up routes into the highly skilled roles that enrich our local economies. The accountancy profession is committed to providing access to education so that anyone with the ability has the opportunity to become a finance professional – wherever they are from around the world.Lastly, our MSPs need to continue to examine how we can be even more connected – how business and government can work together to develop innovative solutions and build the infrastructure required to support a more modernised Scottish economy.: GERS report  Recap: All the political reaction: Scottish Independence: report warns austerity looming outside the UKWhether it is full-fibre broadband connectivity or renewable energy projects – Scotland must adapt to rapidly changing climates and demographics to deliver quality, strategically important infrastructure.Modernising the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail link or dualling the ‘spine of Scotland’ A road will be substantial steps towards securing Scotland’s economic and social development, and laying the very foundation on which our national well-being will be built.But it is a challenge to complete large projects on time and on budget. Clear decision-making, innovative funding mechanisms, proper monitoring and oversight are critical to providing taxpayer value for money.Offshore energy boomInnovation in public spending was the subject of a recent report from ACCA and Chartered Professional Accountants Canada, and it found a lack of political leadership was the single biggest barrier to meeting infrastructure needs. This absence leads to the prioritising of new projects over necessary maintenance. To mitigate this, the UK and Scottish governments should collect data on the potential of existing assets and the performance of previous projects.Next year Glasgow will be the proud host of the international climate change conference, COP. This will see Scotland taking centre stage and leading the global conversation on climate change.To combat the global tide of rising emissions and sea levels, Scotland has invested billions more into offshore energy – as Scottish renewable electricity reached record levels in the first quarter of , enough to power around  per cent of Scottish households for a year.Scotland’s renewable energy sector in particular continues to go from strength to strength.

This target is more ambitious than that set for the UK by some five years. In addition, an ambitious interim target of  per cent by  was also agreed.All this puts Scotland at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Encouragingly, there was a broad consensus across the Holyrood Chamber that this was the right thing to do, although, bizarrely, the Scottish Green Party MSPs abstained in the final vote, refusing to support the Bill which everyone  agreed to.The ambitious targets set last week don’t go far enough for some. I met a number of youth climate strikers outside Holyrood on Thursday, who were both articulate and passionate about their subject. Groups like Extinction Rebellion have certainly helped put tackling climate change at the centre of the political agenda, but on the fringes there is the whf of an end-of-times apocalyptic cult about some of their members.The measures that we are taking to reduce CO emissions are guided by the advice of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If their considered view on what needs to be done changes, then that is the time to take further action.: Why Holyrood must not betray Scotland’s climate strikers – Dr Richard DixonFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereOffshore wind getting cheaperIt also needs to be remembered, in all this debate, that Scotland amounts for a fraction of one per cent of global CO emissions. Meeting our climate change targets will come at a cost, both economically and socially, but the overall impact will do nothing to help save our planet unless the lead we are taking is followed by countries across the world.The point was fairly made in last week’s debate that the setting of targets, however robust, is the easy part what is harder is actually implementing the policies to ensure these targets are met. In the fields of energy, and transport, in particular, we will all have to make dferent choiceswe are to meet the targets we have set.Technological advances will be vital here. Last month saw the award of the latest Contract for Dference by the UK Government, demonstrating another substantial reduction in the cost of electricity generated by offshore wind. Nuclear power, while now relatively more expensive in terms of its unit cost, provides a reliability that other, intermittent, forms of low-carbon electricity generation struggle to meet.In the area of transport, we need to see a modal sht away from petrol and diesel-powered vehicles both to public transport and to inidual vehicles powered by low-carbon sources. Electric cars are still limited in range due to battery size, but as the technology improves costs will reduce, and they will become more attractive.In all this, we do have to be aware of the potential impact of any policy changes on social justice. The fuel duty escalator introduced by the previous Labour Government has now been frozen for eight years running. While it is perfectly possible to make an argument in terms of reducing carbon emissions that the escalator is a valuable policy tool, in practice it is a regressive tax that hits hardest on the poorest households.: Brexit and climate change leave farmers struggling – Alan White:  terrying ways climate change could affect your le in ScotlandUnfair taxes dressed up as ‘green’ policiesIn similar fashion, the SNP’s Workplace Parking Levy or “Car Park Tax”, which could hit those parking at their place of work with an annual charge of up to £, might well be dressed up as a “green” policy, but will hit hard at those who have no alternative but to use their private cars to get to their pace of work.Similarly, low-emission zones in city centres can be got around by those wealthy enough to buy more modern, low-emitting vehicles, but those who can only afford to buy a ten-year-old diesel car will find themselves effectively excluded from city centres. Raising the cost of aviation will mean that the wealthy can still travel by air, while pricing out those who simply want an annual family holiday to the Mediterranean.All this demonstrates why government policies are a blunt instrument which can often have unintended and negative consequences. And it illustrates why inidual responsibility, and personal choices, are as important in the fight against climate change as any legislation that might be passed.Because,we are serious about reducing CO, we will all need to be prepared to live our lives dferently. That means making choices that come at personal cost to ourselves: using the car less, flying less often, turning down the heating, and wasting less food.To give just one example: people will often make the claim thatonly public transport were better, they would make less use of their cars. And yes, public transport can and should be better, but the reality is that evenwe had the world’s best public transport in Scotland, it is still never as convenient as using your own vehicle. The best bus or train system in the world will not pick you up from your front door, and deliver you precisely to your exact destination, by your own preferred route. Using public transport as an alternative to a private car will always mean a sacrice, and it is simply a cop-out to say that we need better public transport before we can make that choice.We don’t need to be Greta Thunberg to realise that we need to take the threat of climate change much more seriously than we have done in the past. The Scottish Parliament has taken a signicant step forward with the legislation passed last week, but on its own it simply won’t be enough. We are all going to have to change our behaviours, and that is going to come at personal cost.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sought advice on sacking prime minister source claims","story":"The monarch reportedly asked aides for first time in her reign just how and when should could dismiss a PM.The Queen sought advice on the circumstances in which she could sack a prime minister ahead of Tuesday’s incendiary Supreme Court ruling, i has been told.A source claims that the monarch asked her aides for the first time for clarication on just when and how she could dismiss a prime minister who refuses to step aside.The alleged consultations reinforce suggestions that the monarch and her most senior aides had deep concerns about Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, even before the country’s most senior court was asked to declare the move unlawful.It was reported on Sunday that Mr Johnson phoned the Queen to personally apologise for the embarrassment caused by the crushing Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully when he advised the monarch to suspend Parliament for five weeks - advice which she was obliged to accept.: Johnson refuses to confirm he apologised to the Queen​ Constitutional crisisi has now been told that the Queen personally asked for advice on the constitutional circumstances in which she can effectively sack a prime minister.Under the rules of the British constitution the Queen can only \"advise, encourage and warn\" ministers. It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm. The yard went into administration in August following the collapse of its Norwegian parent company.InfraStrata said it will retain the  workers who are still employed.Trade union Unite says it expects people toto work as early as this week. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology.

The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

Unplanned is based on the memoir of Abby Johnson, formerly a pro-choice advocate who is now opposed to abortion. It was the fourth-highest grossing film in the US on its opening weekend and it took in m at the box office in its first fortnight. It tells the story of Johnson, who, for eight years, had worked for Americas leading reproductive health organisation Planned Parenthood. She experienced a dramatic change of heart after witnessing a medical termination. In a statement, a spokesperson for Stanton Healthcare NI said: \"We are delighted that this movie will hit the cinema screens across the whole of Ireland, north and south. We have invited many political leaders across Northern Ireland to our special screenings in Belfast, Cookstown and Strabane.\"There is a huge public demand to see this movie, and the cinemas have responded - the people have been heard. At this moment in history, the public have the right to see the truth behind the abortion industry, and the harm it causes to both the mother and the baby. This is exactly what Unplanned unveils. No matter which side of the fence you’re on, no one will leave this film unmoved by Abby’s journey.  \"This personal drama of le-and-death encounters, speaks hope and compassion into the political controversy that surrounds the issue of abortion, especially at this time when abortion is looming over Northern Ireland. The film has been endorsed by many high-profile figures including Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Ted Cruz, who was the runner-up for the Republican nomination in the  presidential election. In a letter to Brunswick Moviebowl in Londonderry seen by the Belfast , Alliance for Choice supporter Shannon Downey said: \"With the current situation in Northern Ireland meaning that decriminalisation of abortion will occur on st October , Brunswick Moviebowl is making a political statement by screening ‘Unplanned’ and therefore saying to the  women from our communities who travel to England for abortion care every year that their business is not welcome at Brunswick Moviebowl.\"In the scene that Abby Johnsons character describes as \"the moment that changed everything\", a -week-old foetus is shown \"twisting and fighting for its le\". \"In this scene the fetus attempts to ‘move away’ from the doctor’s medical instrument. This representation is grossly inaccurate and biologically impossible,\" said Ms Downey.  \"Both the American College and Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist affirm that a fetus does not have the capacity to perceive pain or possess sentience until at least  weeks gestation.\"\"In this film, Planned Parenthood is depicted as a for-profit abortion business. In fact, Planned Parenthood is a non-profit that provides a iety of sexual and reproductive healthcare to millions across the United States. Abortion makes up just .% of its services.\"Choosing to screen this film not only shames women but supplies dangerous myths and lies. I would urge you to reconsider showing this propaganda as it is endangering the women in your community,\" she said. The ODEON and Brunswick MovieBowl have been approached for a comment.   "},{"url":null,"title":"psni to seize uninsured cars as clampdown begins","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The PSNI - along with other police forces across the UK - embarked yesterday on a month-long operation to seize uninsured vehicles.During last years operation, the PSNI seized  vehicles during October and are hoping to achieve similar results this month.Meanwhile, Operation Drive Insured, developed between the MIB and the National Police Chiefs Councils National Roads Policing Intelligence forum , will aim for increased enforcement activity to help improve road safety and raise public awareness of the issue.The campaign follows climbing collision rates caused by drivers without valid insurance.Uninsured drivers also cause a disproportionately high level of fatalities with over  people killed by an uninsured or untraced hit and run driver in the UK each year, according to MIB figures.PSNI Inspector Rosemary Leech explained that during last years operation the force embarked on a sustained social media campaign to accompany their enforcement actions.\"The PSNI recognise there is a well proven link between uninsured vehicles and other forms of criminality,\" said Inspector Leech. \"Thats why this year weve already seized over , vehicles, thereby denying uninsured drivers the means to perpetuate this offence and prevent other illegal behaviour. \"Removing such vehicles reduces the risk to communities and helps us to keep people safe on our roads.\"She added that last years PSNI social media campaign prompted the MIB to comment that their coverage on #opdriveinsured was leading the way nationally with more coverage than ever thought possible.\"The PSNI have access to the industry database of uninsured vehicles which alerts us to the presence of such vehicles, thereby allowing us to focus in on this offending,\" added Inspector Leech. \"The driver will be offered a roadside fixed penalty of £ plus six penalty points as an alternative to court, plus the release fee of £ once they have proved their vehicle is now insured.\"According to MIB, the economic impact of collisions caused by uninsured hit-and-run drivers is considerable.UK-wide government figures for the average value of prevention of road traffic injuries compared against MIBs recorded rates indicate an annual economic cost of over £.bn.This includes costs for emergency services, medical care, loss of productivity and property damage.The economic impact of uninsured driving to the insurance industry comes to around £m each year which is ultimately funded by those motorists who pay insurance premiums.Anna Fleming, chief operating officer of MIB, said the organisation will continue to campaign to reduce the numbers of uninsured drivers. \"Having valid motor insurance is more than a legal requirement, it is designed to protect victims of road traffic collisions by providing them with financial compensation,\" she said.\"We will continue our long standing partnership with UK police to ensure that everyone on the roads has insurance and to make uninsured driving socially unacceptable.\""},{"url":null,"title":"queens university regrets past use of gay aversion therapy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

David started working as an apprentice electrical engineer at the firm last September and now faces the prospect of being kicked off his Northern Regional College course.\"I need to find a placement within four weeks,\" he explained.\"There seems to be a couple of openings, but evenI do get something Im not sure it will be sorted within a month.\" Both men praised Mid and East Antrim Council which rallied more than  employers with , vacancies to the jobs fair. Over  jobseekers arrived at the venue within  minutes of the doors opening - with some companies interviewing applicants on the spot. Davids dad, who worked as a production operator at the failed firm for eight years, still left with concerns.\"He doesnt drive - so hes limited as to where he can accept work,\" Mr Millar said.The married father-of-four and former joiner is also worried about his own career prospects, but expressed relief that he made his final mortgage payment just a few months ago. \"I left the construction industry when it went bad, but Ill probably try and move back into it now, but who knows what will happen. \"My we works part-time and weve no mortgage payments now.\"Ex-production manager William Neillleft feeling optimistic. \"There are plenty of jobs here,\" he said. \"I might not get something doing exactly what I was doing or with the same salary, Ill just have to take whats going.\" One elderly man who was at the job fair to support his son was less optimistic. \"My son has five kids, including a newborn who just arrived three weeks ago,\" he said. \"His we has just started maternity leave.\"The pensioner said his son, who has worked at the firm for  years, is trying to remain hopeful. \"He started when he was  and just out of school,\" he added.\"Its heartbreaking - I could break down and cry, but what good would that go \"This is a great response from local employers and hopefully some good comes from it.\" One newly unemployed family man who has just paid his mortgage payment for this month admitted he has no idea where the money for next months payment is coming from as he left with a handful of application forms. Married father-of-two Timothy Reidwas browsing the dozens of employer stands with his one-year-old daughter Halle. The spray painter has spent six years at Wrightbus, but as some of that time was through an agency he is only entitled to three years redundancy payments. \"I got a contract in October  which means I miss out on an extra year of redundancy by one month.\"Mr Reid, whose we works part-time, is worried about future mortgage payments. He expressed concern for the mental health of his former colleagues and questionedspecial welfare provisions will be put in place for those under pressure. He also made a desperate plea for potential buyers to look to take a good look at the hundreds of protesters who gathered outside Green Pastures Church on Sunday. \"Thats wasnt just a protest, it was a loyal workforce standing in solidarity,\" he said.\"It was men and women who brought their own tools to finish the job when things became grim inside the company. \"The same respect they show to William Wright is hard to find but it can be earned by a new buyer who treats them right.\"Married father-of-two Phil McIlvennahas been with Wrightbus since he left school over  years ago.The coach builder, who started as an apprentice, has spent the last week wondering what hes going to do. \"The longer you sit and dwell on this it gets harder to lt your head but today has given me hope,\" he said. \"I didnt know there were so many jobs out there and that I can transfer my skills.\"Mr McIlvenna praised the Department for Communities and the local council, which has also ensured people have information about CV design and retraining opportunities. Ashley Henderson , who worked in the customer care department until last week, is quietly optimistic about the future. \"We are all devastated - we were like one big family and now we are here competing for the same jobs,\" she said. \"But going by today there seems to be plenty out there.\"However, the newlywed, who recently carried out major renovations on a recently purchased home, is worried about finance commitments. A council spokesperson welcomed the huge response from dozens of companies including those who were unable to get into the venue and confirmed it is considering hosting a similar event next week.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: DCSDC Health and Community Committee and UNISON Community Branch Activists."},{"url":null,"title":"newtown volunteers working around clock look kittens","story":"There are more kittens to be adopted in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection is looking for people to adopt kittens.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensMore kittens are in need of adoption in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensOne of the kittens up for adoption Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection staff are hoping to see more kittens adopted.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensCats protection logo.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"newtown youngsters strike climate change","story":"Climate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Pictured left to right, Kylie DaviesSophie WeaverRuby White, Lyssie Jarvisalt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"unique mix entertainment offer bishops castles michaelmas fair","story":"Barrel organ player, Dave Hill entertains crowds at this year#s Michaelmas Fltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtair.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class. In ,  children attended the school.The writing on the wall came when a proposed merger with nearby Annsborough Integrated Primary School to create a controlled integrated school was abandoned in the face of falling pupil numbers.In May the Education Authority issued a document in which it stated that Castlewellan Primary would close and Annsborough Integrated would be retained.The document said numbers at Castlewellan Primary had declined ldquoto a point where the potential establishment of a controlled integrated primary school was no longer viable.The closure will mark the end of controlled education in the town. Castlewellan High School closed in  when it merged with Killyleagh and Quoile high schools to form Down Academy mdash now Blackwater integrated College mdash in Downpatrick.Mr McLean said staff would continue to give pupils ldquothe best possible education until the school closes its doors for the final time.ldquoI have been here for  years.

Several of them would be subjected to severe political pressurethey made a decision to close on Monday.At the outset of the discussion the boardrsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, said he did not wish to open debate on the already widely discussed issue. The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake. In her view, it might have been quite proper for the Roman Catholic maintained schools take one of their ten optional days holidays to see their spiritual leader of their church.In all but one of the controlled schools in her area good sense had prevailed and those schools would remain open on Monday.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision.

In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town.

It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings.

a period of  days.However, the Northern Ireland Officehas confirmed during that time she spent just  nights in Northern Ireland.Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the NIO said:“According to our records, Karen Bradley spent  nights in Northern Ireland while Secretary of State.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button By contrast, it is understood that Mrs Bradley’s successor in the role, Julian Smith, has spent about half of the working week in Northern Ireland since his appointment in July.In March, Mrs Bradley responded to criticism of how little time she was spending in Northern Ireland by saying that she tried to spend one day a week in the Province.She argued that the number of tight Commons votes - a consequence of a hung parliament - meant that she needed to be in Westminster more than her predecessors.However, while on some occasions Mrs Bradley was required to be in London for votes, she found time for other pursuits.While secretary of state, she personally accepted more than £, in gts, including corporate FA Cup Final tickets, tickets to a music festival, high-end Formula  tickets, Alton Towers tickets and Premiership tickets with hospitality.Last week the Institute for Government proposed a solution to the problem of the secretary of state having to stay in London for long periods due to parliamentary business.The think tank said: “It is also important that the proposed secretary of state should be able to spend a signicant amount of time in Northern Ireland – however tight the parliamentary arithmetic and demands in Westminster may be.“The two major UK parties should agree automatic pairing for the NI secretary to allow that to happen.”Pairing is the Commons system wherebyan MP cannot attend the chamber for serious reasons - such as a bereavement or serious medical condition - the whips agree on a cross-party basis that someone from the other side will not vote, so as to neutralise the effect of their absence.IRA ‘realised it had so many informers it couldn’t kill them all’Boris Johnson gets hero’s welcome at DUP reception, shortly before his Brexit plan for Northern Ireland is reported Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The report also implicitly criticised the calibre of some recent secretaries of state.It said: “The Northern Ireland secretary is an important job in the UK government – but prime ministers do not always treat it as such.“Prime ministers should consider carefully who they make their Northern Ireland Secretary.“It should be regarded as a role for asenior secretary of state who is able to command respect across the political and civil society spectrum in Northern Ireland, and able to fairly represent their views back in London.“Appointments must be made with regard for the interests of Northern Ireland, not just who the Prime Minster needs to accommodate in Cabinet.”try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when asked how he felt about the firm going into administrationHeartbreaking tributes paid to young N.I. woman who died suddenlyWright family deny claims that Wrightbus bidders were put off after being asked too much money to lease the propertyIts official -

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

killed in a crash after her car, driven at speed by a drunk chauffeur, was chased through the streets of Paris by the paparazzi. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Princess of Wales with Harry in Hyde Park in   --Soon after he began dating American actress Meghan Markle, Harry attacked the media over its ldquoabuse and harassmentof his girlfriend, with Kensington Palace warning on his behalf: ldquoThis is not a game ndash it is her le.In , Harryrsquos brother and sister-in-law the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgelaunched legal proceedings against French magazine Closer to stop it re-printing topless photographs of Kate taken while the couple were on holiday.The publication of the images prompted a fierce reaction at the time, with a statement issued by St Jamesrsquos Palace stating they were ldquoreminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the le of Diana, Princess of Wales.A court in Paris banned Closer, which is separate from the UKrsquos Closer magazine, from printing any further images. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were on a Jubilee tour of the Far East when the images were published  --After a trial in ,six people were convicted of charges relating to the taking and publication of the images, and the duke and duchesswere awarded more than , euros in damages for breach of privacy.Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, is not the first member of the royal family to take legal action over breach of .She is suingthe Mail on Sunday and its parent company Associated Newspapers for alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act  after allegations the newspaper unlawfully published a letter she wrote to her father.A spokesman for the newspaper said they stand by their story and will defend the case vigorously. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Duchess of Sussex on the final day of the royal tour to southern Africa  --In , the Prince of Walestook legal action against Associated Newspapers over breach of his confidentiality andfollowing the publication of details from one of his private journals.The duchessrsquos case was announced alongside a y, highly personal and scathing statement from Harry attacking the British tabloid press.But confirmation of Charlesrsquos legal action at the time was followed only by a brief, factual statement from the future kingrsquos then private secretary setting out the case.Charles took the decision reluctantly after extracts from his journal appeared in the Mail on Sunday.His account of the  handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese ndash entitled The Handover of Hong Kong or The Great Chinese Takeaway ndash stretched to , words and included one comment branding Chinese diplomats ldquoappalling old waxworks. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Prince of Wales and the British Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten raise their glasses prior to the handover to China in   --In a High Court ruling, it was found that the newspaper breached the princersquosand confidentiality in publishing extracts.Charles did not give evidence, but had to endure worldwide publicity when a witness statement by his former aide, Mark Bolland, stated that the prince saw himself as a ldquodissidentworking against current political opinion.He was awarded % of his legal costs, and damages, which would have been given to charity, were assessed.Queen Victoriarsquos consort Prince Albert also fought his ownbattle in the courts.He took exception to a printer who published copies of drawings he and Victoria had made of their children as part of a Christmas game.Prince Albert was not amused and sued for breach ofand privacy.The incident which sparked the Prince Albert v Strange case in  was described by the judge as an exercise of ldquosordid

etchings for a proposed exhibition.But Prince Albert successfully obtained an injunction.It still remains rare for the royals to become embroiled in legal action, but others have taken the unusual step.In , Charles obtained an injunction after his former Highgrove housekeeper Wendy Barry brought out a book about his le with Diana, Princess of Wales.The Housekeeperrsquos Diary: Charles And Diana Before The Break-up was published in America.St Jamesrsquos Palace obtained an injunction that entitled Charles to all profits and in effect banned Mrs Berry from living in Britain by threatening her with jail for contempt of court.Concerns over royal privacy involving the Queen started as early as  when her former nanny, Marion ldquoCrawfie Crawford, published the memoirs of her time with Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret with their nurse Marion Crawford on a trip down a river  --Crawfie was shunned from royal circles and the

against The Sun over its publication of the full text of the annual Christmas broadcast two days before its transmission. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen recording her annual Christmas Day message  --The palace declared it was a breach of her .The matter was settled when the paper published a front-page apology to the Queen and offered to donate pound, to the Save the Children Fund.Diana settled out of court over ldquopeeping tom photographs of her working out in a gym.In November , the Queen launched a legal bid to prevent the Daily Mirror from publishing further revelations about journalist Ryan Parryrsquos employment as a footman at Buckingham Palace. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Queen launched legal action after a journalist got a job as a footman at the palace  --The legal row was settled in the High Court when the newspaper agreed to a permanent injunction banning it from publishing further material.The Daily Mirror had to contribute pound, towards the Queenrsquos legal costs.After that security breach and the publication of an autobiography by Paul Burrell, the former butler to Diana, the palace introduced tighter confidentiality contracts to plug loopholes that have made previous agreements dficult to enforce.George V is the only other monarch to have sued in the past  years.In , he successfully won a libel action against a journalist who had published a story claiming the

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.
